HOMOEOPATHIC MATERIA MEDICA 
by William BOERICKE, M.D. 


PREFACE TO THE NINTH EDITION 


In preparing the ninth edition of this work, I have 
followed the lines laid out for all the previous editions, 
namely, to present in a condensed form the homceopathic 
Materia Medica for practical use. 


The book contains the well known verified characteristic 
symptoms of all our medicines besides other less important 
symptoms aiding the selection of the curative remedy, All the 
new medicines and essentials of the published clinical 
experience of the school have been added. In its present 
compact form it contains the maximum number of reliable 
Materia Medica facts in the minimum space. 


I have tried to give a succinct resume of the 


William Boericke ss ae . 
1849-1929, US symptomatology of every medicine used in Homeopathy, 


including also clinical suggestions of many drugs so far not yet 
based on provings, thus offering the opportunity to experiment with these and by future provings 
discover their distinctive use and so enlarging our armamentarium. 


I am aware that there is a difference of opinion about the advisability of further 
introduction of remedies, especially of such as seem obsolete or to some minds illusory. But it is 
not for the compiler to leave out information about any substance that has received the clinical 
endorsement from a reliable source. 


Our Materia Medica must include all substances which have been proved and which have 
been used with apparent efficacy. It rests with the individual student to judge for himself the 
accuracy and, reliability of such observation. In this connection, I cannot forego to avail myself 
of the high authority of that master of Homoeopathy, Dr. Constantine Hering, favoring the 
introduction of all remedies capable of producing reactions in the body that may guide to their 
medicinal employment. "Homeopathy is essentially not only many-sided but all-sided. She 
investigates the action of all substances, whether articles of diet, beverages, condiments, drugs or 
poisons. She investigates their action on the healthy, the sick, animals and plants. She gives; a 
new interpretation to that ancient, oft quoted saying of Paul, Prove all things--a new meaning, a 
new application that acts universally. Elimination of the useless may gradually take place with 
the growth of accurate physiological and pathological knowledge." 


Again, imperfectly proved remedies necessitate the use of names of diseases at times 
instead of the component symptoms that alone are the legitimate guide to the choice of the 
curative remedy. Here, too, I have Hering as pioneer guide for the ligitimacy of this method, 
which he also followed in his great work, the Guiding Symptoms. He said that he used the 
disease designations not for the purpose of recommending the particular remedy for that disease, 
but to show the great variety of remedies that may be used for any form of disease when 
otherwise indicated. For the same reason I have included nosological terms in the 
symptomatology and Therapeutic Index, as this is a practical handbook for every-day service, 


and any aid for finding the curative remedy ought to be utilized. As Dr. J. Compton Burnett 
expresses it: 


"The fact is we need any and every way of finding the right remedy; the simple simile, the 
simple symptomatic similimum and the farthest reach of all-the pathologic similimum, and I 
maintain that we are still well within the line- of Homceopathy that is expansive, progressive, 
science fostered and science fostering." 


The dosage needs some apology. It is, of course, suggestive only; more often to be wholly 
disregarded. I have followed the lines of the earlier Homceopathists in this regard, and given 
what was then considered the usual range of potency, to which I have added my own experience 
and that of many observing practitioners. Every teacher of Materia Medica is constantly 
importuned by students to suggest the potency--something to start with at least. 


The book is in no sense a treatise, and must not be considered or judged as such. It is as 
accurate and reliable a compilation and the fullest collection of verified Materia Medica facts and 
clinical suggestions as it is possible to obtain within the compass of the volume. It supplements 
every other work on Materia Medica, and if used as a ready reminder of the essential facts of our 
vast symptomatology and as an introduction to the larger books of reference and record of 
provings, it will fulfill its purpose and prove a useful aid to the student and general practitioner. 
As such it is again offered with much appreciation of past endorsement to his professional 
brethren. 


I have been aided in seeing this edition through the press by the efficient help of Mr. F. O. 
Ernesty, who has lightened the labor of making the manuscript more acceptable to the printers, 
and I desire to express my hearty appreciation of this kind and helpful service.

ADRENALINUM 


An Internal Secretion of Suprarenal Glands 
(ADRENALIN) 


Adrenaline or Epinephrine, the active principle of the medulla of the suprarenal gland, (cortical 
secretion not as yet isolated), is employed as a chemical messenger in the regulation of the 
activities of the body; in fact, its presence is essential to the activity of the sympathetic nerve. 
Adrenaline action on any part is the same as stimulation of the sympathetic nerve endings 
thereto. Local application (1: 1,000 solution) to mucous membranes promptly induces transient 
ischemia, seen in a blanching, persisting several hours from conjunctival instillation. Its action is 
very prompt, efficient, evanescent, owing to rapid oxidation and therefore practically harmless, 
unless too frequently repeated, when atheroma and heart lesions--myocardial--in animals have 
been reported. Arteries, heart, supra-renal bodies and vaso-motor system are prominently 
affected. The main action of Adrenaline is stimulation of the sympathetic endings, notably the 
splanchnic area, causing constriction of the peripheral arterioles, with resulting rise in blood 
pressure. This is especially observed in stomach, intestines; less in uterus, skin; nil in brain and 
lungs. Furthermore, is noticed, s/owing of pulse, (medullary vagus stimulation), and 
strengthening of heart beat (increased myocardial contractility), resembling Digitalis; increased 
glandular activity, glycosuria; depression of respiratory center; contraction of muscular tissue of 
eye, uterus, vagina; relaxation of muscular tissue of stomach, intestines, bladder. 


Uses.--Its chief therapeutic use depends on its vaso-constriction action; therefore a most 
powerful and prompt astringent and hemostatic; and invaluable in checking capillary 
heemorrhages, from a// parts, where /ocal or direct application is feasible: nose, ear, mouth, 
throat, larynx, stomach, rectum, uterus, bladder. Hemorrhagic condition not due to defective 
coagulation of the blood. Complete b/oodlessness, ischemia, may be induced with impunity. 
Locally, solutions (1: 10,000-1: 1,000) sprayed or applied on cotton have been very efficient in 
bloodless operations about the eye, nose, throat, and larynx. 


Congestions of the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, also hay fever, have been markedly alleviated 
by warm spray of Adrenaline chloride, 1: 5,000. Here compare, Hepar 1x, which will start up 
secretions and so facilitate drainage. Werlhoff's disease, hypodermically, 1: 1,000. Externally, it 
has been used in neuritis, neuralgia, reflex pains, gout, rheumatism, as an ointment, 1-2 m of (1: 
1,000) solution, along the nerve trunk at point of skin nearest its origin which could be reached 
(H. G. Carlton). 


Therapeutically, Adrenaline has been suggested in acute congestion of lungs, Asthma, Grave's 
and Addison's diseases, arterio-sclerosis, chronic aortitis, angina pectoris, hemophilia chlorosis, 
hay fever, serum rashes, acute urticaria, etc. Dr. P. Jousset reports success in treating, 
homeopathically, cases of angina and of aortitis, sub-acute and chronic, when Adrenaline has 
been prescribed per os and in infinitesimal dose. The symptom guiding to this is, Sensation of 
thoracic constriction with anguish. This, with vertigo, nausea and vomiting have been produced 
by the drug. Abdominal pain. Shock or heart failure during anzesthesia, as it causes very prompt 
rise of blood pressure by its action on nerve endings in the vessel wall. 


Dose.--Hypodermically, 1-5 m (1: 1,000 solution, as chloride) diluted in water. Internally, 5-30m 
of 1: 1,000 solution. 


Caution.--On account of its affinity for oxygen, the drug easily decomposes in watery and dilute 
acid solutions. The solution must be protected from air and light. It must not be too frequently 
repeated, owing to cardiac and arterial lesions. For homeopathic use 2x to 6x attenuation.

AGARICUS MUSCARIUS 


Toad Stool-Bug Agaric 
(AGARICUS MUSCARIUS-AMANITA) 


This fungus contains several toxic compounds, the best known of which is Muscarin. The 
symptoms of poisoning do not develop at once, usually twelve to fourteen hours elapse before 
the initial attack. There is no antidote, treatment, entirely symptomatic (Schneider). Agaricus acts 
as an intoxicant to the brain, producing more vertigo and delirium than alcohol, followed by 
profound sopor with lowered reflexes. 


Jerking, twitching, trembling, and itching are strong indications. Incipient phthisis; is related to 
the tubercular diathesis, anzemia, chorea, twitching ceases during sleep. Various forms of 
neuralgia and spasmodic affections, and neurotic skin troubles are pictured in the 
symptomatology of this remedy. It corresponds to various forms of cerebral excitement rather 
than congestion. Thus, in delirium of fevers, alcoholism, etc. General paralysis. Sensation as if

2. More decided intoxication-great mental excitement and incoherent talking, immoderate gaity 
alternates with melancholy. Perception of relative size of objects is lost, takes long steps and 
jumps over small objects as if they were trunks of trees-a small hole appears as a frightful chasm, 
a spoonful of water an immense lake. Physical strength is increased, can lift heavy loads. With it 
much twitching. 


3. Third stage produces a condition of furious or raging delirium, screaming, raving, wants to 
injure himself, etc. 


4. Fourth stage-mental depression, languor, indifference, confusion, disinclination to work, etc. 
We do not get the active cerebral congestion of Belladonna, but a general nervous excitement 
such as is found in delirium tremens, delirium of fevers, etc.

Relationship.--Compare: Muscarine, the alkaloid of Agaricus (has much power over secretions, 
increasing lachrymal, salivary, hepatic, etc, but diminishing renal; probably neurotic in origin, 
stimulating the terminal fibers of the secretory nerves of all these structures, hence salivation, 
lachrymation and excessive perspiration. Atropin exactly opposes Muscarine. Resembles 
Pilocarpin in action). Amanita vernus-spring mushroom-a variety of Agar Phalloides-Death cup- 
active principle is Phallin, active like Muscarine. Amanita phalloides (Death Cup-Deadly 
Agaric). The poison is a toxalbumin, resembling the poison in the rattle snake and the poison 
excreted by the cholera and diphtheria germs. It acts on the red blood corpuscles, dissolving 
them so that blood escapes into the alimentary canal and the whole system is drained. The 
amount of this toxic principle is small, even handling of specimens and breathing of spores 
affects some people unpleasantly. The poison is slow in development. Even 12 to 20 hours after 
taking it the patient feels all right, but vertigo violent choleraic symptoms with rapid loss of 
strength with death the second or third day, preceded by stupor and spasms. Fatty degeneration 
of liver, heart and kidneys, hemorrhages in lungs, pleura and skin (Dr. J. Schier). Vomiting and

AURUM METALLICUM 


Metallic Gold 


Given full play, Aurum develops in the organism, by attacking the blood, glands, and bone, 
conditions bearing striking resemblance to mercurial and syphilitic infections; and it is just for

A Maceration of a Typical Tuberculous Lung introduced by Dr. Burnett 
(BACILLINUM) 


Has been employed successfully in the treatment of tuberculosis; its good effects seen in the

forms of chronic non-tubercular disease are influenced favorably by Bacillinum, especially when 
bronchorrhoea and dyspneea are present. Respiratory pyorrhea. The patient expectorates less. 


Bacillinum is especially indicated for lungs of old people, with chronic catarrhal condition and 
enfeebled pulmonary circulation, attacks of suffocation at night with difficult cough. Suffocative 
catarrh. Tubercular meningitis. Favors falling off of tartar of teeth. Constant disposition to take

Often relieves congestion of the lungs, thus paving way for other remedies in Tuberculosis. 


Skin.--Ringworm; pityriasis. Eczema of eyelids. Glands of neck enlarged and tender. 
Modalities.--Worse, night and early morning; cold air. 


Relationship.--Antimon iod; Lach; Arsenic iod; Myosotis. Levico, 5-10 drops, follows as an

tubercular diathesis before phthisis had developed. In the early stages of tubercular disease of 
glands, joints, skin and bones. Psorinum. Seems to be its chronic equivalent. Bacillin testium acts 
especially on lower half of the body. 


Dose.--The does is important. Should not be given below the thirtieth and not repeated 
frequently. One dose a week often sufficient to bring about reaction. It is rapid in action, and 
good results ought to be seen, otherwise there is no need of repetition.

Hahnemann says: "The action of this substance is very puzzling and difficult of investigation, 
even in the healthy organism because its primary action, more frequently than with any other

organism. On this account it is often difficult to determine what belongs to the vital reactions of 
the body and what to the alternating effects due to the primary action of the camphor."

doses 6 grs each daily (C. Harlan Wells). Paroxysmal tachycardia. Establishes normal heart 
rhythm at least temporarily, less in valvular lesions). 


Dose.--The third to thirtieth attenuation will bring about reaction when the drug is 
homeopathically indicated; but for palliative purposes the physiological dosage is required. For 


this purpose, the tincture made from the fresh plant, in doses of five to twenty drops, when the 
cardiac stimulation is desired, or the infusion of | 1/2 per cent. Dose, one-half to one ounce if the 
diuretic action is wanted. The tincture may be given on sugar or bread, and nothing liquid be 
taken for twenty minutes before or after its administration. Of the powdered leaves, 1/2 to 2

corresponding to the 3d and 4th centesimal. In prescribing it for varicose veins, polypi, catarrh, 
Dr. J. H. Clarke orders an ounce or two of a solution of Formic acid in the proportion of one part 
of the acid to eleven of distilled water. Of this one teaspoonful is taken in a tablespoonful of 
water after food once or twice daily. Pain in aponeurosis and muscles of head, neck and 
shoulders before a snowstorm). Rhus; (Dulcam, Urtica and Juniperus contain Formic acid), 
Wood alcohol, when taken as a constituent of a beverage so common in these prohibition days, is 
not eliminated easily and is slowly converted into Formic acid, attacking the brain and causes 
death or blindness. 


Dr. Sylwestrowicz of the Hering Research Laboratory of Hahnemann College, Philadelphia 
contributes his experience with Formic Acid, as follows: 


"The best field for the formic acid treatment are cases of atypical gout. Under this classification 
are to be mentioned disturbances in the muscles such as myositis, periostitic processes of the 
bones in form of doughy swellings, changes of the fascias such as Dupyutren's contraction, skin 
troubles such as chronic eczema, psoriasis and loss of hair, kidney disturbances such as subacute 
and chronic nephritis. In these cases formic acid in 12x and 30x, hypodermically 1 cc is indicated 
at intervals of 2-4 weeks. Eight till twelve days after the first injection an aggravation is often 
noticed. 


In acute rheumatic fever and acute gonorrheeic arthritis formic acid 6x, every six days | cc, 
sometimes 12x in sensitive patients shows often splendid results abolishing the pains and 
preventing reoccurrence. 


Chronic arthritis needs a special discussion. Clinical experiments of the Hering research 
Laboratory of the Hahnemann Medical College of Philadelphia on a great number of cases of 
arthritis with formic acid showed that it preferably acts on the ligaments, capsula and bursa of 
the joints. Such kind of cases respond very readily to treatment. 


The prognosis depends to a large extent upon the etiology of the case. The most satisfactory 
cases are chronic arthritis in connection with gouty diathesis. Chronic arthritis following an 


attack of acute rheumatic fever shows also remarkable results although often pains of a neuralgic 
character persisting in certain spots are very stubborn. Finally chronic arthritis of traumatic 
nature can be cured by formic acid. In the latter case formic acid 6x showed quicker and better 
results than 12x or 30x which are indicated in the previous cases. In general the disappearance of 
the stiffness of the joint is the first sign of improvement. Then the pain and swelling cease 
gradually in 1-6 months time. 


The prognosis of the formic acid treatment is not so favorably in chronic arthritis in which 
deformans processes have already taken place on the articular surfaces. Such processes in the 
beginning can be checked completely, advanced cases frequently show an improvement. But 
there is always the possibility that this improvement is only temporary. This is particularly to be 
expected in the cases of the so-called arthritis deformans in which even the inflammations on the 
ligaments and capsula are of a very progressive character". 


Dose.--Sixth to thirtieth attenuation. 


FORMALINUM 


Aqueous Solution (35 per cent) of Formaldehyde Gas

power of contraction. We use, as a rule, the first dilution from 6 to 20 drops a day; if after a week 
no decided progress is visible, one drop of the tincture of Iodine is added to each hundred of the 
first dilution. In this way, the mucous tubercles, gummy deposits and ulcerations resulting 
therefrom in the larynx undergo a favorable termination in laryngeal syphilis. " When strictly

Potassium Permanganate for Morphine Poisoning.--Potassium permanganate is recognized as 
being the most effective chemical antidote in cases of morphine or opium poisoning, acting 
directly on the morphine and oxidizing it to less toxic substances. To be effective the 
permanganate must come in direct contact with the opium or morphine in the stomach; 
hypodermatic or intravenous injections are absolutely useless, as the salt would be decomposed 
by the blood serum at once. The approved treatment is administration of two to five grains of 
potassium permanganate in dilute aqueous solution as soon as possible after the poison is taken, 
this amounts to be increased if very large doses of the poison have been taken. Washing out the 
stomach with a quantity of 1 to 500 solution of permanganate is also recommended, using at 
least a pint of this solution either by a stomach pump or by enforced vomiting. Permang of

Epsom Salt 
(MAGNESIA SULPHURICA) 


The skin, urinary, and female symptoms are most marked. The purgative action of Sulphate of

Physiologic Dosage.--Magnes. Sulph is of diagnostic and therapeutic value in Gallstone colic. 
From 2 to 4 teaspoonfuls in glass hot water taken at onset of a colicky attack may abort or stop 
the colic. 


Epsom salt is one of the most active saline cathertics, operating with little pain or nausea, 
especially if pure. It has but little if any effect on intestinal peristalsis, its action causing a rush of 
fluid into the intestine, which by producing a distention of the bowel produces evacuation. It 
causes little or no irritation in the intestine. In common with the other salines, it is the classical 
evacuant to be employed in connection with mercurials and anthelmintics and in cases of 
poisoning. Epsom salt usually acts within from one to two hours, more quickly if taken in hot 
water and in the morning before breakfast. The ordinary dose as a mild laxative is a heaping 
teaspoonful; as a cathartic, two to four teaspoonfuls. The taste may be improved, if necessary, by 
the addition ofa little lemon juice and sugar. 


Besides its chief use as a saline cathartic, magnesium sulphate is used to a considerable extent 
externally in saturated solution as an antiphlogistic and antipruritic in erysipelas, ivy poisoning, 
cellulitis and other local inflammations. Use on compresses saturated with solution. 


Dose.--The pure salt to the third potency. Locally 1:4 in water in septic conditions, erysipelas,

Nux patient is rather thin, spare, quick, active, nervous, and irritable. He does a good deal of 
mental work; has mental strains and leads a sedentary life, found in prolonged office work, 


overstudy, and close application to business, with its cares and anxieties. This indoor life and 
mental strain seeks stimulants, coffee, wine, possibly in excess; or, again, he hopes to quiet his 
excitement, by indulging in the sedative effects of tobacco, if not really a victim, to the seductive 
drugs, like opium, etc. These things are associated with other indulgences; at table, he takes 
preferably rich and stimulating food; wine and women play their part to make him forget the 
close application of the day. Late hours are a consequence; a thick head, dyspepsia, and irritable 
temper are the next day's inheritance. Now he takes some cathartic, liver pills, or mineral water, 
and soon gets into the habit of taking these things, which still further complicate matters. Since 
these frailties are more yielded to by men than women. Nux is pre-eminently a male remedy. 
These conditions, produce an irritable, nervous system, hypersensitive and over-impressionable, 
which Nux will do much to soothe and calm. Especially adapted to digestive disturbances, portal 
congestion, and hypochondrical states depending thereon. Convulsions, with consciousness; 
worse, touch, moving. Zealous fiery temperament. Nux patients are easily chilled, avoid open air,

SACCHARUM OFFICINALE 


Cane-sugar 
(SUCROSE) 


According to the great Dr. Hering, a large proportion of chronic diseases of women and children 
are developed by using too much sugar. Sugar is an antiseptic. Combats infection and 
putrefaction; has a solvent action on fibrin and stimulates secretion by the intense osmotic 
changes induced, thus rinsing out the wound with serum from within outward, favoring healing. 
Leg ulcers. 


Sugar must be considered a sustainer and developer of the musculature of the heart and hence 
useful in failure of compensation and a variety of cardio-vascular troubles. Acts as a nutrient and

mechanical obstruction and delay is due to uterine inertia. 25 grammes dissolved in water, 
several times every half hour.

SAROTHAMNUS SCOPARIUS 


Broom 
(SPARTIUM SCOPARIUM - CYSTISUS SCOPARIUS) 


Spartein sulphate increase the strength of the heart, slows it and reduces the blood pressure. It 
continues the good effects of Veratrum and Digitalis without any of the undesirable effects of 
either (Hinsdale). 


The effect of spartein sulphate (the alkaloid of Broom) is to cause a /owering of the systolic and 
diastolic pressures of the provers. Sphygmograms also show a condition of lowered blood- 
pressure. It depresses the heart by poisonous action exerted on the myocardium and this, with the 
stimulating action of the drug upon the vagus, accounts for the lowered blood pressure and 
reduced pulse rate. It weakens the cardiac contraction. The total amount of urine is increased. 
The drug has, therefore, diuretic properties and is useful in dropsy.

Dose.--For non-homeopathic use (palliative as above), one to two grains t.1.d by mouth, exerts a 
definite action upon the kidneys that will enable them to relieve the distress upon the heart. It is a 
safe drug and prompt in its action. Hypodermically, not less than 1/4 ofa grain. Doses as high as

SERUM ANGUILLAE 


Eel Serum 
(SERUM ANGUILLAR ICHTHYOTOXIN) 


The serum of the eel has a toxic action on the blood, rapidly destroying its globules. The 
presence of albumin and renal elements in the urine, the hemoglobinuria, the prolonged anuria 
(24 and 26 hours), together with the results of the autopsy, plainly demonstrate its elective action 
on the kidneys. Secondarily, the liver and the heart are affected, and the alterations observed are 
those usually present in infectious diseases. 


From all these facts it is easy to infer, a priori, the therapeutical indications of the serum of the 
eel. Whenever the kidney becomes acutely affected, either from cold or infection or intoxication, 
and the attack is characterized by oliguria, anuria and albuminuria, we will find the eel's serum 
eminently efficacious to re-establish diuresis, and in rapidly arresting albuminuria. When during 
the course of heart-disease, the kidney, previously working well, should suddenly become 
affected and its function inhibited; and when besides we observe cardiac irregularities and a 
marked state of asystolia, we may yet expect good results from this serum. But to determine here 
the choice of this remedy is not an easy matter. While digitalis presents in its indications, the 
well-known symptomatic trilogy: arterial hypertension oliguria and edema; the serum of the eel 
seems better adapted to cases of hypertension and oliguria, without edema. We should bear in 
mind that the elective action of the eel's serum is on the kidney, and I believe we can well assert 
that if digitalis is a cardiac, the eel's serum is a renal remedy. So far, at least, the clinical 
observations published seem to confirm this distinction. The serum of the eel has given very 
small results in attacks of asystolia; but it has been very efficacious in cardiac urcemia. There, 
where digitalis is powerless, the serum of the eel has put an end to the renal obstruction and 
produced an abundant diuresis. But its really specific indication seems to be for acute nephritis a 
frigori (Jousset) 


Subacute nephritis. Heart diseases, in cases of failure of compensation and impending asytole. 
The experiments of Dr. Jousset have amply demonstrated the rapid heematuria, albuminuria and 
oliguria caused by it. In the presence of acute nephritis with threatening ureemia we should 
always think of this serum. Very efficacious in functional heart diseases. Mitral insufficiency, 
asystolia with or without cedema, dyspnoea and difficult urinary secretion. 


Relationship.--Great analogy exists between eel serum and the venom of the Vipera. 
Compare also: Pelias; Lachesis. 


Dose.--Attenuations are made with glycerine or distilled water, the lower 1x to 3 in heart disease, 
the higher in sudden renal attacks.

TUBERCULINUM 


A Nucleo-protein, a Nosode from Tubercular Abscess 


Tuberculinum is indicated in renal affections, but caution is necessary, for where skin and 
intestines do not perform normally even high potencies are dangerous. In chronic cystitis, 
brilliant and permanent results (Dr. Nebel Montreux). 


Of undoubted value in the treatment of incipient tuberculosis. Especially adapted to the light- 
complexioned, narrow-chested subjects. Lax fiber, low recuperative powers, and very susceptible 
to changes in the weather. Patient always tired; motion causes intense fatigue; aversion to work; 
wants constant changes. When symptoms are constantly changing and well-selected remedies 
fail to improve, and cold is taken from the slightest exposure. Rapid emaciation. Of great value 
in epilepsy, neurasthenia and in nervous children. Diarrhoea in children running for weeks, 
extreme wasting, bluish pallor, exhaustion. Mentally deficient children. Enlarged tonsils. Skin 
affections, acute articular rheumatism. Very sensitive, mentally and physically. General 
exhaustion. Nervous weakness. Trembling. Epilepsy. Arthritis. 


Mind.--Contradictory characteristics of Tuberculinum are mania and melancholia, insomnia and 
sopor. Irritable, especially when awakening. Depressed, melancholy. Fear of dogs. Animals 
especially. Desire to use foul language, curse and swear. 


Head.--Subject to deep brain headaches and intense neuralgias. Everything seems strange. 
Intense pain, as of an iron band around head. Meningitis. When critical discharges appear, sweat, 
polyuria, diarrhoea, exanthema, repeating the dose only when crises come on. Nocturnal 
hallucinations, awakes frightened. Plica polonica (Vinca). Crops of small boils, intensely painful, 
successively appear in the nose; green, fetid pus. 


Ears.--Persistent, offensive otorrhcea. Perforation in membrana tympani, with ragged edges. 
Stomach.--Averse to meat. All-gone, hungry sensation (Su/ph). Desire for cold milk. 


Abdomen.--Early-morning, sudden diarrhoea (Su/ph). Stools dark-brown, offensive, discharged 
with much force. Tabes mesenterica. 


Female.--Benign mammary tumors. Menses too early, too profuse, long-lasting. Dysmenorrhea. 
Pains increase with the establishment of the flow. 


Respiratory.--Enlarged tonsils. Hard, dry cough during sleep. Expectoration thick, easy; profuse 
bronchorrhcea. Shortness of breath. Sensation of suffocation, even with plenty of fresh air. Longs 
for cold air. Broncho-pneumonia in children. Hard, hacking cough, profuse sweating and loss of 

weight, rales all over chest. Deposits begin in apex of lung (Repeated doses). 


Back.--Tension in nape of neck and down spine. Chilliness between shoulders or up the back. 


Skin.--Chronic eczema; itching intense; worse at night. Acne in tuberculous children. Measles; 
psoriasis (Thyroid). 


Sleep.--Poor; wakes early. Overpowering sleepiness in daytime. Dreams vivid and distressing. 


Fever.--Post-critical temperature of a remittent type. Here repeat dose every two hours 
(MacFarlan). Profuse sweat. General chilliness. 


Modalities.-- Worse, motion, music; before a storm; standing; dampness; from draught; early 
morning, and after sleep. Better, open air. 


Relationship.--Compare: Koch's lymph (acute and chronic parenchymatous nephritis; produces 
pneumonia, broncho-pneumonia, and congestion of the lungs in tuberculous patients, and is a 
remarkably efficacious remedy in lobular pneumonia-broncho-pneumonia); Aviare-Tuberculin 
from birds--(acts on the apices of the lungs; has proved an excellent remedy in influenzal 
bronchitis; symptoms similar to tuberculosis; relieves the debility, diminishes the cough, 
improves the appetite, and braces up the whole organism; acute broncho-pulmonary diseases of 
children; itching of palms and ears; cough, acute, inflammatory, irritating, incessant, and 
tickling; loss of strength and appetite); Hydrast (to fatten patients after Tuberc); Formic acid 


(tuberculosis, chronic nephritis, malignant tumors; pulmonary tuberculosis, not in third stage, 
however; lupus; carcinoma of breast and stomach; Dr. Krull uses injections of solutions 
corresponding to the third centesimal potency; these must not be repeated before six months). 
Compare: Bacil; Psorin; Lach. Kalagua (tuberculosis; garlicky odor of all secretions and breath). 
Teucrium scoradonia. Compare: Thuja (Vaccinosis may block the way of action of Tuberculin- 
until Thuja has been given and then acts brilliantly (Burnett). 


Complementary: Calcarea; China; Bryon. 


Dose.--Tuberculin needs more frequent repetition in children's complaints than nearly every 
other chronic remedy (H. Fergie Woods). Thirtieth and much higher, in infrequent doses. When 
Tuberculinum fails Syphilinum often follows advantageously, producing a reaction. 


"The use of Tuberculinum in phthisis pulmonalis demands attention to the following points: In 
apyretic purely tubercular phthisis results are marked, provided the eliminative organs are in 
good order, but nothing below the 1000th should be used, unless absolutely necessary. With 
patients where streptostaphylo-pneumococci are in the bronchi; where also after washing the 
sputum, a pure "t b. " bacilli-mass remains, the same treatment is indicated. With mixed 
infection-found in the majority of cases-where the sputum swarms with virulent micro-organisms 
in addition to the "t b. ", other procedure is necessary. If the heart is in good shape, a single dose 
of Tuberculinum 1000-2000 is given, provided there are no marked indications for other 
remedies. With due attention to temperature and possible excretions, the dose is allowed to work 
until effects are no longer observed, eight days to eight weeks. Usually a syndrome then presents, 
permitting the accurate choice of an antipsoric Silica, Lycopodium, Phosphorus, etc. After a 
while the picture again darkens and now a high potency of the isopathic remedy corresponding to 
the most virulent and prominent micro-organism found in the sputum is given: Staphylo-Strepto- 
, or Pneumococcin. The accurate bacteriological analysis of the sputum is absolutely essential; 
the choice of the ison again clears the picture, and so, proceeding on the one side etiologically 
(where these isopathica have not yet been proved); on the other side symptomatically with 
antipsoric remedies, the disease is dominated. 


My own experience warns, in the case of mixed infection, against the use of Strepto-, Staphylo-, 
or Pneumococcin below the 500th. I use them only from 2000 to 1000, having seen terrible 
aggravations from the 30, 100, 200, with a lowering temperature from 104 to 96. Hence the 
admonition, which need not concern scoffers, but those alone who wish to avail themselves of a 
potent weapon. The toxins used as remedies are, like Tuberculinum, prepared from pure and 
virulent cultures. 


And cases, seemingly condemned to speedy death, are brought in a year or two back to normal 
temperature, though, of course, sacrificing a large portion of lung tissue. This result is sure when 
the patient can and will take care of himself, where the heart has withstood the toxin and the 
stomach and liver are in good function. Further, climatic variations must be avoided. With the 
great mineral metabolism of the phthisic, diet regulation is imperative, and should be 
preponderately vegetable, together with the addition of physiological salts in low potency, 
Calcarea carb, 3x, 5x, Calcarea phos, 2x, 6x, and intercurrently according to indications organ- 


remedies as Cactus Tr. 30, Chelidonium Tr. 30, Taraxacum Tr, Nasturtium Tr, Urtica urens Tr, 
Tussilago farfara Tr, Lysimachia numularia Tr, for short periods. 


The first dose of Tuberculinum in any difficult case is, however, the most weighty prescription. 
The remedy should not be given without a most careful cardiac examination. As the surgeon 
before the anzesthetic, so must the physician know the heart before administering this drug, 
especially to children, and seniles-and to young seniles. He who observes this rule will have 
fewer clinical reproaches on his conscience. When Tuberculinum is contraindicated, recourse 
must be had to the nearest antipsoric. 


The above caution applies also to asthma, pleuritis, peritonitis in scrofulous (tuberculous) 
subjects. " (Dr. Nebel Montreux)

Preface to the Ninth Edition (Boericke) 


In preparing the ninth edition of this work, I have followed the lines laid out for all the previous 
editions, namely, to present in a condensed form the homceopathic Materia Medica for practical 
use. 


The book contains the well known verified characteristic symptoms of all our medicines besides 
other less important symptoms aiding the selection of the curative remedy, All the new 
medicines and essentials of the published clinical experience of the school have been added. In 
its present compact form it contains the maximum number of reliable Materia Medica facts in the 
minimum space. 


I have tried to give a succinct resume of the symptomatology of every medicine used in 
Homeopathy, including also clinical suggestions of many drugs so far not yet based on provings, 
thus offering the opportunity to experiment with these and by future provings discover their 
distinctive use and so enlarging our armamentarium. 


I am aware that there is a difference of opinion about the advisability of further introduction of 
remedies, especially of such as seem obsolete or to some minds illusory. But it is not for the 
compiler to leave out information about any substance that has received the clinical endorsement 
from a reliable source. 


Our Materia Medica must include all substances which have been proved and which have been 
used with apparent efficacy. It rests with the individual student to judge for himself the accuracy 
and, reliability of such observation. In this connection, I cannot forego to avail myself of the high 
authority of that master of Homceopathy, Dr. Constantine Hering, favoring the introduction of all 
remedies capable of producing reactions in the body that may guide to their medicinal 
employment. "Homeopathy is essentially not only many-sided but all-sided. She investigates the 


action of all substances, whether articles of diet, beverages, condiments, drugs or poisons. She 
investigates their action on the healthy, the sick, animals and plants. She gives; a new 
interpretation to that ancient, oft quoted saying of Paul, Prove all things--a new meaning, a new 
application that acts universally. Elimination of the useless may gradually take place with the 
growth of accurate physiological and pathological knowledge." 


Again, imperfectly proved remedies necessitate the use of names of diseases at times instead of 
the component symptoms that alone are the legitimate guide to the choice of the curative remedy. 
Here, too, I have Hering as pioneer guide for the ligitimacy of this method, which he also 
followed in his great work, the Guiding Symptoms. He said that he used the disease designations 
not for the purpose of recommending the particular remedy for that disease, but to show the great 
variety of remedies that may be used for any form of disease when otherwise indicated. For the 
same reason I have included nosological terms in the symptomatology and Therapeutic Index, as 
this is a practical handbook for every-day service, and any aid for finding the curative remedy 
ought to be utilized. As Dr. J. Compton Burnett expresses it: 


"The fact is we need any and every way of finding the right remedy; the simple simile, the 
simple symptomatic similimum and the farthest reach of all-the pathologic similimum, and I 
maintain that we are still well within the line- of Homceopathy that is expansive, progressive, 
science fostered and science fostering." 


The dosage needs some apology. It is, of course, suggestive only; more often to be wholly 
disregarded. I have followed the lines of the earlier Homceopathists in this regard, and given 
what was then considered the usual range of potency, to which I have added my own experience 
and that of many observing practitioners. Every teacher of Materia Medica is constantly 
importuned by students to suggest the potency--something to start with at least. 


The book is in no sense a treatise, and must not be considered or judged as such. It is as accurate 
and reliable a compilation and the fullest collection of verified Materia Medica facts and clinical 
suggestions as it is possible to obtain within the compass of the volume. It supplements every 
other work on Materia Medica, and if used as a ready reminder of the essential facts of our vast 
symptomatology and as an introduction to the larger books of reference and record of provings, it 
will fulfill its purpose and prove a useful aid to the student and general practitioner. As such it is 
again offered with much appreciation of past endorsement to his professional brethren. 


I have been aided in seeing this edition through the press by the efficient help of Mr. F. O. 
Ernesty, who has lightened the labor of making the manuscript more acceptable to the printers, 
and I desire to express my hearty appreciation of this kind and helpful service.

San Francisco, June, 1927. 


Prefatory Note to the Repertory (Boericke) 


With the advent of the incomparable Ninth Edition of the progressive pocket Materia Medica, its 
modest companion, the Repertory, has been completely remodelled and brought up to date, by 
embodying much of the newly incorporated material. Many of the Sections have been carefully 
rewritten, and, with appropriate expansion, offer a more trustworthy guide for the selection of the 
homeeopathic remedy. A few prefatory remarks, pertaining to the practical and expeditious use 
of the repertorial contents, may assist in clarifying a certain inevitable obscurity of plan. 


Firstly, in conformity with established repertorial methods, the division of the sections in 
somewhat the old Hahnemannian order is adhered to, and may be stated as follows: Mind; Head; 
Eyes; Ears, etc. 


Secondly, for the purpose of convenience, solely, headings and sub-headings and specific 
conditions or symptoms comprised under the latter are arranged in alphabetical order, and this is 
more or less consistently adhered to throughout the entire work. For example, under Mind the 
headings read, Awkward, brain-fag, catalepsy, etc.; likewise the heading Delirtum embraces its 
various phases in alphabetical order. 


Thirdly, all headings when extensive in scope -e.g., Headache, are presented under definite 
captions in the following order: Cause, Type, Location, Character of pain, Concomitants, 
Modalities -i.e., Aggravations and Ameliorations. It is to be observed that some headings include 
only a few, whereas others include all of these divisions. This method has been resorted to 
simply to facilitate the task of the use of the repertory. 


Fourth, to preserve uniformity, the technical names of diseases are bracketed, thereby assuming a 
subsidiary place, which is in strict accord with the homceopathic requirement, to prescribe for the 
symptoms of each specific case, and not for a mere name of a disease. Of course, being a clinical 


and not a truly symptomatological index (for which the practitioner and student are referred to 
the monumental works of Kent, Knerr and Clarke) technical terms are often selected as main 
headings, and when feasible, the more or legs complete symptoms constitute the sub-headings. 


Fifthly, the remedies are arranged in alphabetical order, and the italics indicate the more 
frequently verified clinical remedy. The abbreviations of the remedies are purely arbitrary and 
self-explanatory. 


A complete alphabetical Index, newly added, will surely offer much assistance to the busy 
practitioner, in the ready reference to the specific information desired. 


Lastly, it is only by the persistent use of one repertory, that its peculiar and intricate 
arrangements gradually crystallizes itself in definite outline, in the mind of the student of the 
same, and thus he attains the ready ease and practical insight of the collator, thereby rendering 
such a clinical bee-line well-nigh indispensable in our day of labor-saving devices.
