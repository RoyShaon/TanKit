Preface to First Edition
This course of lectures on the Homeopathic Materia Medica was delivered at the Post-Graduate School of Homoeopathics.
Some of them have appeared in the journal of Homoeopathics, but for this work they have been extensively revised.
Owing to the strong appeals of students, though against the author's inclination, the colloquial style has been permitted to stand.
The lectures are presented in the simple form to explain the author's plan of studying each remedy.
The speech of laymen presents all sickness to the physician's mind, hence the Materia Medica must be reduced from technicalities to simple speech. No two remedies are studied exactly alike. Each has its own requirement in order to bring before the mind what is characteristic.
Not all of the Materia Medica has been brought out, but the leading and fully proved remedies such as have strong characteristics have been presented for the purpose of showing how the Materia Medica must be evolved and used.
There are other methods of studying a remedy, but this seems to the author the most natural way of giving to the student a lasting idea of the nature of each remedy. It may be that it seems so because it is the only way the author could ever do it.
The numerous repetitions of characteristic symptoms may subject the work to criticism, but experience has shown that it is the only way of giving the beginner a lasting grasp of the remedy.
Hahnemann's Materia Medica Pura, Hering's Guiding Symptoms, and the Encyclopedia of Pure Materia Medica have been the works that have given the most help in these studies.
They are not offered as being complete digests of the various remedies, but simply as the examinations of some of the most salient points.
A complete digest would be endless. If some of the younger practitioners and students of the Materia Medica shall meet the assistance in this work they have been looking for, it is all that can be expected. There is no royal road to a perfect understanding of the Materia Medica.
It is tedious and drudgery at best, but no more so than any great science. Because of its greatness, many will fail to undertake it even when it is for the saving of life and lessening of suffering, yet many will not decline to offer their services to the people knowing full well and confessing ignorance openly that the methods they offer are inadequate, useless, and often destructive.
Some profess not to believe in this careful way of analyzing the symptomatology, but if some easy method is offered for a pretended mastery of it they wildly embrace it only to return to their primitive repulsive mental aversion crying out "sour grapes."
The Materia Medica can be learned by careful study and by using it. It can be understood but not memorized.
All who would memorize the Materia Medica must ignominiously fail. To be constantly at hand, it must be constantly and correctly used. The continuous study of the Materia Medica by the aid of a full repertory for comparison is the only means of continuing in a good working knowledge.
To learn the Materia Medica, one must master Hahnemann's Organon, after which the symptomatology and. the Organon go "hand in hand." The Organon, the symptomatology, and a full repertory must be the constant reference books, if careful homeopathic prescribing is to be, attained and maintained.
All who wish to make a more extensive examination of the reason for the methods used in the work are referred to the chapter on value of symptoms in the Lectures on Homoeopathic Philosophy.

Preface to Second Edition
These lectures were first published because of the numerous requests from pupils who had listened to them in classroom. Now comes a demand for a second editing which preserves its original colloquial style which was used by the lecturer in the classroom. Many remedies have been added and the whole work has been revised.
Many remedies are in a new and later form of presentation. While the "symptom list" is a most important form in the homoeopathic Materia Medica, yet it is hard to grasp the idea of the remedy from that form when it is listened to by students.
The author has adopted a quasi clinical method of stating and grouping symptoms in a manner to bring out an image of each remedy. This is done in order that pupils may understand a remedy as a whole and in parts rather than tire the memory which is always overworked in a medical college.
The "symptom list” will always remain the best form for a reference text, but it has been observed by long teaching that many pupils who fail to grasp the remedy from the list learn the Materia Medica well in the quasi clinical and colloquial form.
If these lectures shall enable some practitioners to more fully comprehend our polychrests then all that has been hoped for has been gained. It is believed that the human mind is only able to hold a general image of each remedy.
A specific consideration such as is often demanded in the management of a complex group of symptoms either in the office or at the bedside must always demand close repertory examination.

Abrotanum
Introduction: This a very valuable remedy should be more frequently used. It is indicated in such conditions as are cured by Bryonia and Rhus tox., but its symptoms mark out its own individual cases.
Rheumatic conditions with heart irritation; epistaxis; bloody urine; anxiety and trembling, when there has
been a history of diarrhoea. A suddenly checked diarrhoea will be followed by violent cardiac symptoms; it is much like Ledum, Aurum and Kalmia.
Marasmus: In marasmus of children it is a very useful remedy and not unfrequently indicated. The emaciation begins in the lower limbs and gradually spreads upward, so that the face is the last affected; that is the opposite of Lycopodium, Natrum mur. and Psorinum.
Chest: It has cured pleurisy after Bryonia, which seemed indicated, had failed. A woman lying in bed with dyspnoea, anxiety, cold sweat and pain in the heart was surrounded by friends to see her die.
It was learned that she had suffered for many months with a rheumatism in one knee, that she had used crutches to get about the house, and that she had recently been speedily cured (?) by a strong liniment only a few days before this attack. Abrot. restored her to health promptly.
It has caused and cured burning ulcerative pains in the stomach with suspicious vomiting. Metastasis: Metastasis is a marked feature in Abrot. The changing of one so called disease into another
always calls attention to Abrotanum. Inflammation of the parotid (mumps) changing to tests or mammae is generally cured by Carbo v. or Pulsatilla, but Abrot, has cured when these remedies have failed.
Suppression: A suddenly checked diarrhea followed by piles and acute rheumatism, with bleedings, as mentioned above, is further argument in favor of this idea.
The Abrot. patient is sensitive to cold air and cold damp weather. He suffers much from backaches, and his symptoms are worse during the night.
In boys it cures hydrocele.
Acetic Acidum
Introduction: There is either diarrhea or constipation; with the latter he is rheumatic, with the former he is at his best, as when the diarrhea slacks up he is full of suffering.
Generals: The diarrhea is his great relief, like Natrum sulph. and Zincum. Sharp pains here and there, but especially in ovaries and joints.
This remedy is, useful in complaints of pale, sickly people.
Patients who have been weak for many years, who have inherited phthisis, Emaciation, weakness, anaemia, loss of appetite, burning thirst and copious pale urine are a combination calling for Acetic acid.
Sensation of heat with pulsation coining and going, like orgasms; chlorosis in young girls; dropsical conditions in general; bad effects from stings and bites, have been cured by this remedy.
Vinegar is an old remedy for bad effects from chloroform. It is useful in the hemorrhagic constipation. Bleeding from various mucous membranes, nose, stomach, rectum, lungs and from ulcers. Sensitive to cold.
Mind: Confusion of mind does not know her own children; forgets what has recently happened attacks of anguish; constantly borrows trouble thinks something is going to happen; peevishness, complaining.
Fainting spells in weak, anaemic subjects; headaches; face pale and waxy; epistaxis; one cheek pale and the other red; diphtheria in throat or larynx, unquenchable thirst; sensitive stomach; vomiting blood, and all food taken; ulceration of stomach; hot, sour eructations; frothy vomiting; gnawing pain; distension of stomach, with a constant commotion; burning in stomach and abdomen, ameliorated by lying on the stomach.
Abdomen: In the abdomen there is great pain, distension, flatulence or dropsy, sore to touch; diarrhea, thin, bloody or pure blood; profuse bleeding from piles; chronic diarrhea.
Urines: Copious watery urine. It has cured diabetes, with sugar in the urine or without, where there is great thirst, weakness and pallor and loss of flesh.
Genital: Weakness with seminal losses; relaxed genitals and swollen feet. Uterine haemorrhage; copious menses, or watery menstrual flow scanty menses with chlorosis.
Larynx and chest: Weakness of larynx; croup; diphtheria. It has cured many cases of laryngeal diphtheria; hoarseness, with pale mucous membranes; chronic dry, hacking cough in sickly, pale persons, such as have inherited phthisis, with oedema of extremities, diarrhea and dyspnoea, or night sweats; haemorrhage from the lungs; burning in chest and stomach; rattling in chest; chronic bronchitis.
Extremities: Weakness and lameness in extremities, with swelling, rheumatic or oedematous; dropsy of limbs, with diarrhea.
It is a deep-acting, constitutional remedy, and when well studied will be very useful.
All substances abused as food become great remedies, such as vinegar, coffee, common salt, etc. We should look to them oftener than we do for the stubborn chronic cases.
Aconitum Napellus
Introduction: Aconite is a short-acting remedy. Its symptoms do not last long. It is a violent poison in large doses, either destroying life or passing away in its effects quite soon, so that if the patient recovers, the recovery is not delayed. There are no chronic diseases following it.
Like a great storm, it comes and sweeps over and passes away. By a little meditation we will discover what kind of sickness all this is like, and what kind of a patient is most likely to have that short, sudden sickness.
If we think a moment from experience and homoeopathic observation, we will remember that vigorous, plethoric individuals, when they take cold, come down violently, whereas feeble people, sickly people, come down and recover slowly from acute diseases, and do not become so violently and so suddenly sick.
From this, and from examining the sudden effects of Aconite, it will be easy to see that persons who come down with Aconite sicknesses are plethoric individuals.
Strong, robust people, rugged children and infants become sick, not a very slight cold, or from slight exposure, but from more violent exposure. From being exposed with deficient clothing; from (sudden, violent changes; from prolonged exposure to the cold, north, dry wind.
A vigorous person caught out with thin clothing, or remaining out in the cold, dry air of mid-winter, with its sudden, violent changes, comes down even before night with violent symptoms. This is the class of patients, the plethoric and vigorous, who have a strong heart, active brain, vigorous circulation, and come down suddenly from violent exposure, that need Aconite.
Aconite has in its nature none of the results usually following inflammation. The storm is over so quickly that it seems mostly to conform to the earlier condition. In these vigorous patients sudden congestions are likely to be thrown off by good reaction.
The patient seems to be threatened with a sudden and violent death, but recovery is quick. So, as was observed by Dunham, it is a great storm and soon over. Dunham's discussion of this remedy in his Materia Medica is very poetical and well worth reading.
Generals: Attacks come on suddenly from exposure to a dry, cold wind. In plethoric children we have an illustration of that in, the sudden congestion of the brain with intense fever, or with convulsions.
We get illustrations of its suddenness and violence in any organ of the body, the brain, the lungs, the liver, the blood, the kidneys. It is suited to the complaints that come on suddenly from the very cold weather of winter, or from the intensely hot weather of summer.
It has the lung and brain complaints of winter, and the bowel inflammations and stomach disorders of summer. We know how these plethoric individuals become suddenly overheated and become violently sick.
Their sudden attacks are frightful to look upon. All these inflammatory conditions are attended with great excitement of the circulation, violent action of the heart, a tremendous turmoil of the brain, a violent shock. with intense fear.
Mind: The mind symptoms that are nearly always associated with Aconite conditions stand out in bold relief.
The patient feels the violence of his sickness, for he is under great nervous irritation and excitement.
Fear is depicted upon his countenance, and the heart's action is so overwhelming the first thing he thinks of is that he must die; this must mean death, which he fears. It stands out upon his countenance.
He says:
"Doctor, there is no use; I am going to die."
Many times he actually predicts the moment or the hour of his death. If a clock is in the room, he may say that when the hour hand reaches a certain point he will be a corpse.
When we see this intense fear, this awful. anxiety, great restlessness, the violence and the suddenness of these attacks, we have a case, perhaps, that is dying from the poison of Aconite, or one who needs Aconite.
One who has a sickness resembling the poison of Aconite needs the smallest possible dose of Aconite. It is a very short-acting medicine, and that must be remembered.
It hardly matters what part of the body we are considering we will find inflammatory conditions. But regardless of the region or the locality of the inflammation, that which I have described is the appearance of the patient. Such are the symptoms that will stand out, that you will observe first - the appearance of the face, the mind symptoms, the restlessness, the intensity.
Now, there are many little mental symptoms that are of much less importance than this fear, this anxiety, symptoms that will be masked by these marked symptoms that indicate the patient. He has lost all affection for his friends. He does not care what becomes of them, he has not the slightest interest in them. It sometimes may be a state of indifference.
What I have brought out will enable one to readily see that this picture does not belong to all the remedies in the Materia Medica. In fact, it belongs only to Aconite. No matter what remedy you compare this with, you would find it only under Aconite.
You will find some of the features in the text under other remedies, but those which I have mentioned collectively will be found only under Aconite.
Take the mental symptoms, intensity marks every one of them. If it is a delirium, it is an intense delirium, with excitement, with fear, with anxiety.
Patients in delirium, with excitement and fear, will weep, as in great torment.
Great excitement, fear, fear of death. You wonder what she is weeping about. There are all sorts of moods intermingled also with the fear of Aconite.
There is moaning and irritability, anger, throwing things away, all attended. with the violence and anxiety. These features that I described as uppermost are intermingled with all the other symptoms.
"Screams with pain."
The pains are like knives, they are stinging, cutting, stabbing. The intensity of the Aconite suffering is wonderful, so that if the nerves take on neuralgic pains the pains are intense. It is the feeling that some awful thing must be upon him or he could not have such dreadful suffering.
It says in the text, "predicts the day of his death."
This to a great extent is the result of the awfulness that seems to be overwhelming him. And this mental
picture is always present, in pneumonia, in inflammatory conditions of any part of the body, in inflammation of the kidneys, of the liver, of the bowels, etc.
Vertigo: Dizziness prevails throughout all this symptom picture. "Vertigo, turning and whirling."
A woman out shopping runs up suddenly against a dog and becomes violently dizzy, she cannot even get to her carriage.
"Vertigo that comes on from fear, from sudden fear, and the fear of the fright remains." There is a remnant of that fear left, but it will lead you no more strongly towards Opium. "Complaints from fear. Inflammation of the brain from fear, dizziness from fear."
Even congestion of parts as a result of fear. A turmoil in the whole sensorium. Things go round and round.
Head: The headaches can hardly be described, they come with such violence. Tearing burning in the brain, in the scalp, attended with fear, with fever, with anguish; headache from taking cold, from suppressing catarrh in the nose.
Catarrh stops suddenly in plethoric people, from exposure, from riding in the dry, cold wind such as we have in this northern climate in winter.
"Violent headache over the eyes.
Congestion of the brain, with congestive headache, with anxiety, with hot face." Eyes: The symptoms that would lead you to give Aconite for affections of the eye are numerous.
Eyes take on sudden inflammation. Congestion of the eye. Blood red appearance of the eye.
Sudden inflammation of all the tissues; conjunctivitis, etc., from taking cold, from exposure to dry, cold winds.
There is a teaching that has long prevailed: give Aconite for the first stage of an inflammation. It is not good teaching, although it is recommended in all of our books. It does not say for what kind, of a constitution, or how it comes about.
Do not practice that way. Get all the elements for an Aconite case, if possible, or give a better remedy. Another practice has prevailed, viz., giving Aconite for fever. Aconite was the fever remedy of many of our early routinists, but it is a bad practice.
Aconite has an inflammation of the eyes that comes on so suddenly that one wonders how that inflammation came in so short a time.
The eyes take on great swelling without any discharge, or only very watery mucus. The sudden inflammations that come on with thick discharges would never be Aconite.
Fever and Chills: Aconite has no results of inflammation. Those conditions that are about to take on the results of inflammation will always indicate some other remedy. You are not to think of Aconite in fever unless the Aconite patient is present.
With the Aconite fever there will be sensitiveness to light. "Great restlessness with fever." Eyes staring, with pupils contracted, "violent aching and inflammation of the deep structures of the ball."
Give Aconite only when the symptoms agree. An inflammation that is about to run a prolonged course, to take on suppuration, or if it is mucous membrane to take on discharge of pus, will never show you the symptoms of Aconite.
Never give Aconite in blood poisoning, such as we find in scarlet fever, in typhoid fever, etc. We find nothing of the violent symptoms of Aconite in such conditions. The nervous irritation is never present, but the opposite, the stupor, the laziness, the purple skin - whereas Aconite is bright red.
Never give Aconite for any form of zymosis, for it has no zymotic history. There should be no thought of Aconite in the slow coming, continued fever. Aconite has no symptoms like the slow types of continued fevers.
The Aconite fever is generally one short, sharp attack of fever. It is in no way related to an intermittent fever, as it has no such symptoms.
You might find something that would deceive you in one attack of intermittent fever, but the very fact that there was a second one would shut out Aconite. Some remedies have periodically or waves, Aconite has no such a condition.
The most violent attack of fever will subside in a night if Aconite is the remedy. If it is not it is a pity that you made a mistake in giving it, for it will sometimes do mischief. All things that exist in a sickness must be taken into account, not only what the remedy does cover, but what it does not cover.
Aconite has inflammation of the eyes, with burning and sudden swelling; the lids swell so rapidly that they cannot be opened except with great difficulty, and when they are forced open by seizing the margins of the lids with a pair of forceps drops of hot water will fall out, but no pus.
This comes on rapidly from taking cold. Whenever there are inflammations of the mucous surfaces bloody water is apt to flow.
Suddenly the blood vessels become engorged and ooze, the blood vessels rupture and the capillaries ooze. Ears: Inflammation of the ear comes on just as suddenly. "Throbbing, intense, cutting pains in the ear."
The child comes home after being out in the cold north wind, and is not sufficiently clad, and now it screams and puts its hand to the ear. The attack comes on early in the evening, after being out in the daytime.
Fever and anxiety; child must be carried. The suffering is intense. Noise intolerable. Music goes through every limb, so intense is the sense of hearing.
Everywhere in the body will we find that same intense condition of the nerves. Wherever there are complaints they are intense, violent, and the patient is always in a state of anxiety and irritability.
"Stinging, burning, rending, tearing, cutting pains in the ear."
Coryza: Coryza if attended with violent headache, coming on in the night after exposure and taking cold during the day, suddenly, this short acting, very quick-acting remedy will be indicated.
The coryza that comes on from Carbo veg. comes on several days after the exposure. The coryza that comes on from Sulphur also develops several days after the exposure.
The Carbo veg. patient becomes overheated and takes cold by keeping on his overcoat when he comes into your office. In Aconite he goes out in cold air with his light clothing, and comes down, if he is a plethoric individual, before midnight.
But especially is it often indicated in the coryza of the rosy, chubby, plethoric baby. Not in the sickly or pale ones.
These sickly ones will come down later; their vital activities are so reduced that their complaints do not come on sometimes for two, or three days.
So that if you take a sickly one and a vigorous one in the same family and expose them both one will have croup tonight and need Aconite, and the other will have it the next morning and need Hepar.
Face: The symptoms likely to occur with coryza are nosebleed, headache, anxiety and fear. The anxious expression is one of the first things observed in the Aconite sufferer. The Aconite pneumonia will often show itself on the face.
Look at the face; there is great anxiety. It shows much of the proving of Aconite. You know there is much in the expression of the face that will enable one to read all that is going on in the body; it tells the story,
The pleasures and sadness, and the distress of the human family, much of which you can generalize, and see at a glance that some great thing has happened. You have only to guess once or twice before you hit it. Here you have the anxiety.
"One cheek red and the other pale” is in a good many remedies, but the anxious expression, and the fear, and the heat, and the restlessness, and the suddenness with which it comes on in a plethoric individual yesterday it was very dry and windy - and you will at once place this symptom with Aconite.
But it might be one of several other remedies, were other conditions present. "Neuralgic pains in the face, like hot wires running along either side of the face."
The individual rides in the cold, raw wind, and his face was exposed to the cold wind. He becomes numb, then pain sets in, intense pain.
He cries out and shrieks with the knife-like cutting pains. Aconite will relieve.
"Crawling, creeping like ants"; Aconite has that sensation along the course of the nerves. It has a sensation like ice water poured along the course of the nerves.
Sciatica when the sensation is felt down the nerve like ice water. "Creeping, tingling and crawling in the face, with or without pain."
There is intense heat intense fever in the face. The side of the face laid on will often break into a sweat, and if the patient turns over, that side will at once become dry, and the other side will at once break out in a sweat.
Mouth and teeth: Oh, what a comforting remedy it is for toothache.
It has been so useful in toothache that nearly every old lady nowadays knows enough to put a drop of Aconite on a bit of cotton and put it in the old hollow tooth. It will quite often palliate.
A dose of Aconite will act much better. But the violence of the toothache; again the same old story, from the dry, cold winds, plethoric individuals, with hollow teeth, pain intense, cutting, shooting pains in the teeth.
Sometimes these pains are in sound teeth and affect the whole row of teeth. Violent pains from exposure, such as riding in the wind. The pains are relieved and go away speedily after a dose of Aconite.
Disturbances of taste, disordered stomach. Everything tastes bitter, except water; and, oh, how the Aconite patient longs for water. It seems almost impossible for him to get water enough and it agrees well.
Burning is a symptom that runs all through the remedy, you will find it descriptive of all the pains. Burning in the head, burning along the course of nerves, burning in the spine, burning in fever, sometimes burning as if covered with pepper.
Throat, palate and tonsils: Aconite is a very useful medicine in inflammation of the throat, when there is burning, smarting, dryness, great redness of the tonsils, or the fauces, the whole throat.
Sometimes the soft palate is greatly swollen. A high grade of inflammation, acute inflammation of all that can be seen and called throat. But that alone would not indicate Aconite.
It cures that kind of case, it cures inflammation of the throat, but every homoeopathic physician knows that forty or fifty remedies could be selected just as well as Aconite from all that I have said.
I have only mentioned a nondescript case. No homoeopathic physician could prescribe upon that kind of evidence.
But you note the kind of throat - every physician must ask himself the question: "What would make that kind of a throat an Aconite case?" And then the question would come up, could he not prescribe for it as well if he had not seen, the throat?
The throat does not do much towards representing, to an intelligent physician, the patient.
If it was necessary to represent to the mind of the physician the inflamed part itself, how would he treat the liver?
He cannot see it. How would he prescribe for the stomach? He cannot see it. We are then compelled to fall back upon that which represents to the intelligent physician the very nature of the patient himself, and then at once we will see the reason for some of these things.
If you present and Aconite patient well before the mind you can prescribe. It would be well to see anything that is visible. If you could see, the liver, I would say look at it. If you could see the heart, I would say examine it.
What is it in this throat that really represents the patient?
Of course, any soreness of the throat makes it difficult swallow. I mean to infer that there is nothing in the soreness to represent to the physician the Aconite patient. If that individual were a plethoric individual, if he had been riding in a cold, raw wind a good part of the day, and he had wakened in the night with a violent burning, tearing sore throat, and he could not swallow, and the fever came on high, and he had thirst for cold water and he could not get enough of it, he was in an anxious, feverish state, you have then a
patient to prescribe for.
Many times will patients become intelligent enough under your observation to write just what some member of the family acts like. You know just what the patient looks like.
The black man will sometimes give the best kind of a description, better than the Vassar girl, who writes us:
"Doctor, will you please send the medicine have looked into the throat and it is red."
Stomach: With the stomach symptoms what an anxious patient we have! The pains are dreadful.
Burning pains, tearing pains, with anxiety, with restlessness, with fever, coming on from taking cold - not from overeating, but from taking cold, which has settled in the stomach; from exposure to an ice bath, or in
a very hot summer from intense heat, associated with an irritable brain in vigorous children.
Vomiting and retching, tearing, as it were, the very inside out by the awful retching. The vomiting of blood, bright red blood.
This is descriptive of the general stomach trouble. During this febrile state he craves bitter things, wine and beer, and brandy, but they will come up as soon as they reach the stomach.
He craves pungent things, nothing tastes bitter enough.
"If he could only get something bitter." And yet his food tastes bitter, everything he eats tastes bitter, everything except water.
The word in the text is a clinical word; it says "gastric catarrhs."
It is a very sharp, acute inflammation of the stomach. Retching, vomiting, of bile, vomiting of blood. Ineffectual urging to vomit, when there is nothing in the stomach.
With it there will be anxiety, restlessness, fear of death. The fear depicted upon the countenance makes an awful expression.
Aconite is a useful medicine in inflammation of the liver, when it comes suddenly. It is not very useful in repeated attacks, but in the first attack.
Liver: Violent inflammation of the liver, with violent tearing pains and much burning. Then comes the restlessness, the awful tortures of anxiety, moving constantly, fear of death, red face, glassy eyes, great thirst.
"Anxious restlessness” covers nearly all of these things.
Abdomen: In the abdomen there are shooting pains, burning, stinging pains, after exposure to cold, becoming chilled.
We will soon come to think that it does not make much difference where the disorder occurs, we must have the Aconite patient.
We also have inflammatory troubles of all the viscera of the abdomen. It may be a violent catarrhal inflammation. It may be a catarrhal condition of the lower portion of the colon, or a catarrhal condition of the rectum, when we will have a dysentery.
In dysentery, that which is found in the commode is almost pure blood, blood and a little slime. It seems impossible for him to leave the commode.
Vomiting a little blood and passing bloody mucus from the rectum. Always they will predict they will die tonight, or in a few hours. They look as if they realized the sensation of death.
The whole body is in a state of anguish, but the tenesmus and cramp, the urging to stool are simply terrible. It has a watery diarrhea, but that is not a very important symptom, although it is doubly marked in Hering.
But when pure blood is passed, and mucus, with tenesmus, or when a little green mucus is passed by infants with summer troubles, pure blood or grass-green discharges with fever coming on suddenly, in bright, rosy little ones, think of Aconite.
Most of the bowel troubles come on from intense heat, in the children. The infant takes on inflammation of the liver from the heat, and the stool becomes white like milk, of putty consistency. The child becomes yellow and screams with pain.
Urinary organs: It is useful in urinary troubles, bladder and kidney troubles. inflammatory conditions, and with bloody urine.
Scanty urine, suppressed urine, or retained urine. Retention from shock. This retention from shock makes it one of our best remedies for retention in the new-born.
The infant just born into the world has undergone a shock. At your next visit the nurse says,
"The child has not passed urine."
The functions of that little one are not yet established, because of the great shock the little one has gone through.
Inflammation of the bladder, with cutting, tearing pains. Burning pains with burning urine. Urine is hot, dark, colored red; red and clear, or bloody.
Retention from cold, especially in children, with crying and restlessness. With inflammatory conditions of the bladder, either in adults or in infants, there will be all the mental states representing the Aconite patient.
Genital: Aconite cures most violent cases of orchitis, which come on suddenly.
Orchitis from cold, from being chilled, in plethoric men. But in the common orchitis from suppressed gonorrhoeal discharges Aconite is useless.
The woman is a natural Aconite patient, with her sympathetic natural sensitiveness. She usually takes on complaints from nervous shock, from fear, and she naturally takes on complaints from causes other than those from which men take on sickness.
It is very seldom that fear will give a man inflammation, but fear is a common cause of inflammation of the uterus, and of the ovaries, in plethoric, vigorous, excitable women.
Fear will often cause abortion, but when Aconite is given early enough it will check the abortion that comes from fear.
We will have the stitching, burning, tearing pains of Aconite sometimes following fear or sudden emotion. Sometimes a pregnant woman will say,
"Doctor, there is no use your planning for my confinement.
I know I am going to die in that confinement."
If there is any one thing that is a really strong symptom to prescribe on it is that, A dose of Aconite, and then change the subject, she goes away, and in a few days you ask her about that fear and she says, "Oh, never mind that."
Many little things like that can be singled out. But that state of fear is a very peculiar thing, and really represents the whole nature and being of the woman.
She predicts the day of her death. The reason that Aconite is so often the infant's remedy is because the infant is so often made sick from fright.
"Inflammation of the genitals in plethoric women."
Aconite is more frequently indicated in women and children than in men. Sensitive, vigorous, excitable women.
It is indicated in men in inflammatory conditions from becoming chilled in dry, cold air, and it is wonderful how you can convince a patient who needs Aconite what wonderful things there are in Homoeopathy by
showing him how rapidly, with Aconite, you can put him in a sweat and break up a sharp fever when that is a recent and single attack.
"After tedious and difficult parturition. Violent after-pains. Shooting, tearing after-pains, with febrile conditions."
Uterine haemorrhage with bright red blood and fear of death. It is wonderful what Aconite will do in some cases arising from taking cold in the puerperal state, but do not mix that up with puerperal fever.
The first is a simple form, non-septic; perhaps the breast is involved, with soreness in the breast, suppression of the milk and febrile conditions; but if there is suppression of the lochia do not give Aconite.
New-born children, with difficulty of breathing, after the use of forceps, or from a tedious labor; the child is breathless, there is difficulty with the heart, and in a few hours fever comes on. Aconite is a very simple remedy.
The retention of urine in the infant is so commonly an Aconite condition that you will hardly ever need to use any other medicine.
The little one cannot yet talk, it cannot manifest very much, and, to a certain extent, the practitioner is compelled to be somewhat routine in these affairs, and the routine practitioners have been more or less successful with Aconite for the retention of the urine. Again, it is true that in many cases, of retention of the urine in the mother, it will disappear after a dose of Causticum.
Throat: Aconite is a great routine croup remedy, one that is misused; but it is indicated in all those cases of croup which come on suddenly in plethoric children, from exposure to dry, cold wind, having been out in the cold wind with the mother during the day.
The child is put to bed and rouses up from the first sleep, perhaps at 9 or 10 or 1 o'clock, grasps the throat, coughs violently, a croupy, choking cough, with hoarse bark.
Hardly any other remedy can correspond to that rapidity of action, taking cold in the daytime and developing itself so suddenly.
Croup that comes on from exposure today, and does not develop until tomorrow morning or tomorrow evening, may correspond to quite a number of other remedies but especially Hepar, which is slower in its pace.
And it is more suitable in children somewhat run down and subject to frequent attacks of croup.
Spongia is also similar, but it lacks many of the elements more likely to occur in run-down children, those always taking cold.
It would be a difficult matter to distinguish between the appearance of the Aconite and the Spongia croup so far as the croup is concerned, because both have all the anxious appearance found in croup.
The Aconite croup is a violent croup, inflammation of the larynx, and, at the same time, spasms of the larynx, coming on with great rapidity.
The Spongia croup is less inflammatory, the inflammation grows with the spasms; but while Spongia may rouse up at 1 o'clock at night, suffocating and choking, it has not the intense febrile excitement that belongs to Aconite, nor the anguish, although it has all the dryness that is found in Aconite.
Aconite conditions are dry as a usual thing, or there is only a little watery discharge.
Spongia is entirely dry; if there is an inflamed mucous membrane, it is dry. We have in the croup symptoms in Aconite: Larynx sensitive to touch.
"Croup, waking in first sleep, after exposure to dry, cold winds."
Lungs and respiration: Aconite is full of disturbances of respiration, dyspnoea from contraction of the smaller bronchial tubes, which we find resembles asthma.
It is indicated in that dyspnoea that belongs to capillary bronchitis, in that dyspnoea that belongs to cardiac excitement in plethoric persons, from taking cold, becoming exposed or from shock.
Dyspnoea from fear, such as occurs in nervous women, excitable, easily affected, nervous, plethoric women. Breathing short, labored, anxious, quick,
It is an asthmatic dyspnoea and there is usually dryness of the mucous membranes of the small bronchial tubes.
"Sits up straight and can hardly breathe."
Aconite has such a sudden violent cardiac irritation, pulse fluttering, weak, full and bounding; sits up in bed, grasps the throat, wants everything thrown off; before midnight, a hot skin, great thirst, great fear- everything is associated together.
"Anguish with dyspnoea. Sudden attacks of pain in the heart, with dyspnoea." All go together. "Great suffocation.”
From this fear and from anxiety he breaks out in profuse sweat; he is drenched with sweat - and yet he is hot.
When this anxiety passes off he becomes hot. So there is heat and sweat with this awful anxiety. Pulse like a thread.
"Better during expiration." The spasm of the larynx often comes on during inspiration.
"Worse during inspiration.
Constant short, dry cough.
Difficult breathing.
Breathes only with the diaphragm. Chest troubles, such as pneumonia."
Aconite produces a very rapid inflammation of the viscera of the chest, of the pleura, of the lungs, of the mucous membrane lining the air passages. In pneumonia we have this dyspnoea, the suddenness with which it comes on. If it spreads rapidly it may go into pneumonia.
Inflammation runs so high that the mucous membrane oozes blood, cherry red, or the mucus that comes up is white and heavily streaked with bright red blood.
You go to the bedside of broncho-pneumonia and you will find in the pan mucus streaked with bright red blood. Now, take the violence with which that comes on, the restlessness and anxiety of the individual - he predicts the hour of his death - that would be the case with the Aconite patient.
In the case of pneumonia where the lung is involved, it is likely to be the upper half of the left lung when Aconite is indicated.
Sometimes the whole mucous membrane, the visible throat, the larynx, trachea, the bronchial tubes, will all ooze blood, sometimes a mouthful of blood, so violent is the inflammation.
In these chest troubles there is much pain. Shooting, burning, tearing pains, and the patient is compelled to lie in a somewhat elevated position, on the back.
Cannot lie upon either side, but upon the back. Lying on the side increases the pain. The dry cold winds. Sudden shocks, in persons of good, strong, vigorous circulation. The Haemoptysis that is spoken of is not such as occurs in phthisis, but is involuntary; the blood comes up with a slight cough.
Some one might be deceived to give it in such cases in broken down constitutions in sickly patients; but it is not to be administered in such cases, we have much better remedies.
The patient does not always become a pneumonia patient, but inflammation of the small air passages may be all that is present.
"Dry cough, vomiting and retching, intense fever, spitting of blood." No expectoration except a little watery mucus and blood. It occurs a good deal in this way.
Dry cough, sensation of dryness of the whole chest, sensation of dryness in the larynx and throat. Pours down great quantities of cold water, and once in a while after a violent coughing spell he gets up a little blood. But the expectoration is generally mucus.
Pneumonia is generally attended with an expectoration looking like iron rust, as if iron rust had been mixed in with it. Such medicines as Bryonia and Rhus tox, and a few others have that expectoration as a common feature, as natural to the remedies themselves, but Aconite is the cherry - red, bright red expectoration. Its hemorrhages are bright red, and sometimes copious.
All these coughs in pneumonia, in croup, and chest troubles come on suddenly, and if he goes to sleep he will have spasm of the larynx, with dryness of the larynx. He goes to sleep and the larynx becomes dry and he wakes up and grasps his larynx; he thinks he is going to choke.
All these come on from cold winds. Vigorous persons get into a draft and get a chill that will bring on Aconite symptoms.
Aconite has in all inflamed parts a sensation as if hot steam were rushing into the parts, as if warm blood
were rushing into the parts, or "flushes of heat in the parts.” Along nerves, a sensation of heat, or sensation of cold.
The pulse in the highest form of the fever is full and bounding; strong, vigorous pulse. When the attack is first coming on and the awful anxiety and nerve tension are present the pulse is very small, but after the heart's action is well established, then the pulse becomes stronger.
"Tearing pains down the spine.
Painful, stiff neck.
Crawling in the spine like insects".
That is a peculiar feature, this crawling sensation; it comes from cold, from being suddenly chilled. Extremities: "Trembling of the hands" associated with these sudden acute attacks.
"Creeping pains in the fingers" associated with these sudden acute inflammatory attacks.
"Cold as ice. Feet cold as ice.
Hot palms."
Hot hands and cold feet are sometimes present. Rheumatic conditions of the joints. Those that come on as a first attack. Not old rheumatic and gouty attacks, but those that come on as acute rheumatism, those that come on from sudden exposure to cold, from long rides in a dry, cold wind.
They also are attended with fever, with anxious restlessness, with a critical state of mind so often described. "Trembling, tingling, convulsions of the muscles."
But the nerves are full of Aconite symptoms and Aconite sufferings. Aconite is a wonderful remedy for neuritis in plethoric persons.
Numbness along the course of the nerves, from cold, from exposure. Numbness and tingling, along the course of the nerves, especially those that run close to the surface.
"Inflammation of the nerve sheaths. Nervous excitability.
Excessive restlessness.”
Relations: Sulphur has a strong relation to Aconite. It has many Aconite symptoms. In many of the old chronic cases where Sulphur would be used in strong, vigorous constitutions Aconite will be suitable for a sudden attack, and Sulphur for the chronic.
In sudden attacks that Aconite conforms to, that is the whole attack, there may be left in that constitution a tendency to return of a similar attack.
Aconite has no power over that tendency, but Sulphur has. Of course, most of the symptoms must agree but it will seem to you frequently where Aconite has been suitable in the acute disease that Sulphur symptoms will follow, and many times a very violent attack leaves a weakness in the constitution which Aconite has no power to contend with. It has no power to keep off recurrent attacks. It does all that it is capable of doing, and that is the end of it. But it is not so with Sulphur.
After Aconite follow well Arnica and Belladonna. Sometimes it is true it will appear to you that Aconite is capable of coping with all there is in the disease.
But there seems to be a lingering something that holds on, and such medicines as Arn. and Bell., and Ip. and Bry., do have to come in to finish up the attack or sometimes Sulphur. Very commonly Silica. So we have to study the relations of medicines.
If you have administered Aconite in too many doses, or given it too strong, and your patient is slow in recovering from the attack, or your patient has taken Aconite himself unwisely, then Coffea or Nux will often put the patient into a better condition.
Actea Racemosa
Introduction: This remedy has been only meagerly proved, yet there are a few useful points in it.
From its proving we can perceive that it is similar to diseased states in the human family, and especially in women, namely, hysterical and rheumatic conditions.
The patient is always chilly, easily affected by cold, sensitive to cold and damp weather, which rouses the rheumatic state and develops a state of rheumatism not only in the muscles and joints all over the body, but also along the course of nerves.
In the general nervous disturbance there is a lack of will balance, or great disturbance in the voluntary system, which is the underlying feature of hysteria, the symptoms are intermingled with rheumatism.
With the pains we have soreness all over the body. Trembling, numbness, jerking of muscles.
Inability to exercise the will over the muscles of the body, turmoil in the voluntary system, with stiffness.
Tendency to take cold and thereby she takes on sensitiveness in the glands and larger organs, such as the liver and uterus.
Complaints in these organs come on from cold damp weather (Dulcamara) and from being chilled.
The patient is sensitive to cold in all parts except the head, and is aggravated from becoming cold both in parts of the body and in general.
The headaches, however, are better in the open air and from cold, which is an exception and a particular, for the general feature is aggravation from cold.
Mind: There is a terrible mental state that alternates with physical states. It is an overwhelming sadness or gloominess, she is bowed down with sorrow.
Sits and mopes in great sadness, like Psorinum and Pulsatilla.
This may pass off instantly, or be brought on and aggravated from motion, from fear, from excitement, from taking cold.
Very commonly there is muscular soreness, a bruised feeling all over, with drawing and jerking. This will let up very suddenly and leave a nervous, hysterical girl in a state of sadness, and she will sit and say nothing. When questioned perhaps she will break into tears or ex press in various ways the
overwhelming sadness.
With the headache there is marked sadness. Changeable moods. The physical and the mental are all the time changing. Other symptoms alternate and change.
The jerking has made physicians see the resemblance to chorea in these hysterio-rheumatic constitutions.
The rheumatisms will change in a day into chorea, and again the choreic movements will keep on with the soreness throughout the muscles of the body.
The jerking and soreness and numbness often keep on together.
There are certain features about the chorea that should be noted. Jerking of the muscles when in a state of emotion or from becoming chilled. If any part of the body is pressed upon jerking of the muscles of that part will take place.
One of these nervous, rheumatic, hysterical subjects may not have chorea constantly, but as soon as she retires at night the whole of the side lain on will commence to jerk and prevent her from going to sleep. If she turns on the back the muscles of the back and shoulders will jerk and prevent sleep.
She turns over on the other side, but after a little while the muscles pressed on commence to jerk. All this time she has become so restless and nervous that she is driven to distraction.
The mind is full of all sorts of imaginations and the body is full of all sorts of uneasiness, because she can find no place to rest upon.
Sometimes the muscles are so sore that they cannot be lain upon for any length of time; sometimes it is a numbness, sometimes a jerking.
These things are queer, but they belong to the patient, affecting not one part, but the whole economy.
Full of fear, anguish and restlessness. Fear of death, excitement, suspicious, "Will not even take the medicine because there is, something wrong about it" .
It has a mania such as occurs in nervous, hysterical women, and it has cured puerperal mania.
Puerperal mania from taking cold during or soon after confinement. The remedy belongs especially to women, because its symptoms are so commonly associated with the affections of women.
Mental states following the disappearance of rheumatism is a strong feature. The rheumatism gets better, but the mental state becomes worse.
Sometimes the rheumatism disappears in short order and the mind is not disturbed, but then it is because a diarrhea has come on, with great soreness and aching in the bowels, or because a flow from the uterus has given relief.
There must be some relief or a disturbance will take place like Abrotanum. Some flow must be established, and hence the menstrual flow or diarrhea gives relief; otherwise the mind takes on trouble, the patient becomes gloomy, or has a low form of mental excitement.
One of the symptoms is quite descriptive of this sadness I have referred to:
"Sensation as if a black cloud had settled all over her," while at the same time it weighed like "lead upon the head."
This is entirely figurative. It can all be expressed in the word "sadness".
moe
We will find "melancholy," "gloominess ... .. low spirited," etc., running all through out text, but the word "sadness" is just as broad as any of them.
Head: The headaches are rheumatic.
"Sore, bruised feeling all over the head. Bruised sensation in the occiput. Sore, bruised feeling in the top of the head, as if the top of the head would fly off."
"As if cold air was blowing upon the brain." Yet most of these headaches are better by being in the cold air. "Headache brought on from catching cold, from the weather changes, cold, damp weather."
There are many headaches. Pressing headache. Many of the headaches are intense, and described as if a bolt were extending down into the back of the neck. Soreness in the back of the neck. Pain in the back of the neck. Hysterical girls; they have much pain in the back of the neck.
With the headache the eyeballs are very sore, "painful to turn in any direction."
"Pain in the eyes, bruised pain in the head."
"Soreness in the abdomen; sore and bruised. Alternate diarrhea and constipation. Alternation of diarrhea and physical complaints."
Genitals female: We pass now to the female genitalia, which form a center for a great deal of trouble in the remedy. A routine saying about Actea is that it makes confinement easy.
That is not a legitimate saying concerning any remedy and such expressions encourage routine practice. It is true that when this remedy has been given to pregnant women in accordance with its symptoms it has proved capable of making confinement easy.
But the way it has been given has been the routine practice of giving it in the tincture or in the 2d or 3d, until the patient was under its influence even when it was not indicated, as it was not similar to the case.
But the homoeopathic physician never practices in this way. A remedy fits a general condition when the symptoms of that general condition are found in the remedy.
Remember that it does so because all the symptoms agree. "Pain in the uterine region, darting from side to side. Bearing down and pressing out."
These bearing down sensations, taken with all the other states that relate to the patient in general, show that it is a very useful remedy in prolapsus of the uterus.
It has the relaxation of the parts. Do not suppose that our remedies are not sufficient to cure these conditions, when the symptoms agree. It is true that remedies will cure prolapsus when the symptoms agree, and at no other time.
If it fits the patient in general, these bearing down sensations will go away, the patient will be made comfortable, and an examination will finally show that the parts are in normal condition. You cannot prescribe for the prolapsus; you must prescribe for the woman. You cannot prescribe for one symptom, because there are probably fifty remedies that have that symptom.
There are menstrua! disorders in these hysterical rheumatic constitutions. Irregularity of the menstrual flow. It may be copious, suppressed or scanty. Severe pain all through the flow.
The more the flow, the greater the pain. That is very peculiar. Generally the flow will relieve pain, but with this remedy the pain is during the flow. Generally the most severe and most painful attack is at the beginning of the flow, and with some women again just after the flow has ceased.
Each woman is a law unto herself. In this remedy the sufferings are during the menstrual flow as a rule. The most severe mental symptoms, the most severe rheumatic symptoms, the most extreme jerking and cramping of the limbs and sleeplessness are during the menstrual flow.
During menses, epileptic spasms. All sorts of sufferings in the nerves. Soreness along the course of the nerves, soreness in the muscles or joints during the flow. Increase of mental symptoms.
Cold and chilly, must be wrapped rip.
"Rheumatism. Dysmenorrhoea."
"Soreness in the uterus and ovarian region. Lame, bruised feeling all, over; painful menstruation,"
and some one has named that rheumatic dysmenorrhoea, not a bad name.
Pregnancy: Many symptoms during pregnancy. It cures all sorts of conditions, in this kind of constitution, these nervous, rheumatic, fidgety women with jerking in the muscles.
So markedly do her troubles alternate with each other that alternation is in the nature of her case. You will commonly find that all the rest of her troubles have passed away, and that now nausea has come on. In all the years past she has had a hysterical constitution, but now when she is pregnant she has nausea all the time.
You will find when one set of symptoms becomes extremely severe others have temporarily subsided, and so they change about like Pulsatilla.
But the symptoms have to be taken collectively to get at the image of the patient. A woman will come to you with one group of symptoms today and may come back to you with an entirely different group ina couple of weeks.
These are very troublesome cases to prescribe for, and you have sometimes to take the symptoms a dozen times and put them all together as if she had felt them all in one day, and so make your prescription.
A hysterical patient is difficult to manage because of this changing of symptoms, and also because she has a tendency to deceive the doctor.
"Shivering in the first stage of labor. Hysterical manifestations through labor."
Pains have all ceased or are irregular, so that they do not good. No dilatation has taken place. But when the regular pains come on we have some important symptoms.
A pain comes on and it seems to be about to finish satisfactorily; it has been regular and prolonged until about two-thirds through, and all at once she screams out and grasps her hip-the pain has left the uterus and gone to the hip, causing a cramp in the hip, and she has to be rubbed and turned over.
This medicine will regulate the pains, and when the next pain comes it will hold on to the end.
So impressionable is this woman during confinement that if she is subjected to any emotion - such as having an emotional story told in the room - or if anything excitable occurs, the pain will stop.
If she has passed through the labor and the lochia has been established, from such a cause the lochia will stop, as if she had taken cold, and she will have cramps and troublesome after-pains, the milk will be suppressed, she will feel sore and bruised all over, and have fever.
This remedy should be compared with Caulophyllum, which has the following symptoms:
Weakness in the reproductive system of the woman. From weakness she is sterile, or she aborts in the early months of gestation. During parturition the contractions of the uterus are too feeble to expel the contents, and they are only tormenting.
Labor-like pains during menstruation with drawing pains in the thighs and legs, and even the feet and toes. Uterine haemorrhage from inertia of the uterus. Relaxation of muscles and ligaments. Heaviness, and even prolapsus. Subinvolution. Excoriating leucorrhoea. Menses too soon or too late.
She is sensitive to cold and wants warm clothing-quite unlike Pulsatilla. She is hysterical, like Ignatia. She is fretful and apprehensive. She is rheumatic, like Actea, only the small joints are most likely to be affected.
Later she suffers from after-pains, and they are felt in the inguinal region. Rheumatic stiffness of the back and very sensitive spine.
She is sleepless, restless and withal very excitable. This remedy has cured chorea at puberty when menstruation was late.
You need not be surprised that such an emotional subject has a fluttering, quick pulse, and irregular, action of the heart, but many of the most marked hysterical features are present without any disturbances whatever in the action of the heart.
"A feeling in the region of the heart as if the heart were sore, and as if it were enlarged.” "Back of head and neck sore." The head is drawn back from contraction of the muscles at the nape. Violent aching down the back.
Rheumatism in the back. Impossible to lie upon the back because of the contraction of the muscles of the back. impossible to lie upon the slide of the body because of the contraction and jerking of the muscles.
"Numbness of the limbs. Trembling. Soreness."
The symptoms of the nerves are simply a reiteration of what I have said. "Hysterical spasms. Convulsions. Trembling of the legs; hardly able to walk." The numbness is such as is associated with paralysis. Paralytic weakness.
The best effects have resulted from the 30th, 2ooth, 1000th and still higher potencies, and from the use of medicine in single doses.
It is similar in some of its conditions to the Blue Cohosh.
Compare it with Puls., Sepia, Natr. mur., Lit. t., Caulophyllum, and Ign.
Aesculus Hippocastanum
Introduction: A peculiar kind of plethora is found running through this remedy, a vascular fullness which affects the extremities and the whole body, and there are symptoms showing that the brain is similarly affected.
Modalities: The conditions of Aesculus are worse during sleep, hence symptoms are observed on waking.
He wakes up with confusion of mind, looks all around the room in confusion, bewildered, does not know the people, wonders where he is and what is the meaning of the things he sees.
It is especially useful in children that rouse up in sleep frightened and in confusion, like Lycopodium.
The remedy produces great sadness, irritability, loss of memory and aversion to work. There are times when there is a sense of bodily congestion, fullness of the veins, and then these symptoms are most marked.
It is a general venous stasis, and is sometimes worse in sleep, worse from lying, better from bodily exertion.
The symptoms pass away after considerable exertion; moving about, doing something, keeping busy relieves.
You will find it useful in persons who suffer from palpitation when the pulsation extends to the extremities and the throbbing of the heart in sleep can be heard; an audible palpitation.
Mind: Now, as the mental symptoms are the most important in a proving, so are the mental symptoms in sickness the most important.
Hahnemann directs us to pay most attention to the symptoms of the mind, because the symptoms of the mind constitute the man himself.
The highest and innermost symptoms are the most important, and these are the mind symptoms. Aesculus has not been brought out in the finest detail, but we have the key to it. Extreme irritability is the very general state from which ramify a great many mental symptoms.
Irritability and mental depression run through a great many remedies, and form the centre around which revolve all the mental symptoms in some cases.
The reason that these are more interior than some other symptoms of the mind is that these relate to the affections themselves.
The mental symptoms can be classified in a remedy. The things that relate to the memory are not so important as the things that relate to the intelligence, and the things that relate to the intelligence are not so important as the things that relate to the affections or desires and aversions.
We see in a state of irritability that the patient is not irritable while doing the things that he desires to do; if he wants to be talked to, for instance, you do not discover his irritability while talking to him.
You never discover he is irritable if you do the things he wants you to do. But just as soon as you do something he does not want, this irritability or disturbance of the will is brought on, and this is the very innermost of the man’s state.
That which he wishes belongs to that which he wills, and the things that relate to what he wills and the most important things in every proving.
You may say that an individual is sad, but he is sad because he lacks something that he wants; he desires something which he has not and becomes sad for it; sadness may go on to such an extent that the mind is in confusion.
Confusion of mind and vertigo. Make this distinction, vertigo is not confusion of the intelligence. You have only to meditate upon it a moment and you will see that it is not.
Confusion of the mind is a disturbance of the intellect, not disturbance of the sensorium; you will make a distinction between staggering when walking and a period of disturbance of the mind, with inability to think clearly.
Vertigo is a sensation of rolling, and belongs to the sensorium. A great mistake has been made in some of our repertories, in that confusions of mind are placed with vertigo under sensorium.
These things must be thought out carefully, so that we are clear in our own minds as to what symptoms mean when they are given to us by patients.
A patient may state that when walking in the street he is dizzy or that it appears as though everything interiorly were turning around, yet he may be perfectly able to add up a column of figures; his mind may be clear.
If we ourselves are perfectly clear as to the meaning of these expressions, we will commonly glean the meaning of the patient. It is important to record the language of the patient, yet often a patient will say something which you can see he does not mean at all, and it then becomes necessary to put in a parenthesis what he really means. For instance, a patient says:
"I have such a pain in my chest," with the band on the abdomen, or a woman when menstruating will say the pain is in the stomach when you know it is in the uterus.
Patients must be questioned oftentimes as to their statements, or requested to place the hand upon the painful part. In the same way, therefore, patients talk about dizziness when they are not dizzy at all, but feel a confusion of mind, or they speak of confusion of mind when they mean that they stagger in the street.
It is in the nature of this remedy to have flying pains all over the body, like Pulsatilla and Kali carb., flitting,
sharp, shooting, tearing pains, flying from one part to another; they seem at times to be scarcely more than skin deep. Sometimes they fly along the course of the nerves.
Head: This remedy is full of headache. It has also dull aching pain, when it seems that the brain would be pressed out. But especially are these pains felt in the back of the head, as if the head would be crushed; hard aching pains, violent aching pains, fullness of the brain.
"Dull frontal headache, from right to left, with constrictive feeling of skin of forehead."
Fullness of the head, with dull, heavy pains, aching in the forehead; pain over the right eye.
"Neuralgic pains in the right supraorbital region."
"Shooting in left parietal bone, later in right."
Formication of the scalp. If you examine the skin you will find formication, tickling and shooting and itching all over the body, so what there is in the scalp is only what belongs to the remedy in all parts.
Eyes: Aesculus is a wonderful eye remedy, especially when the eyes have "hemorrhoids" . Does that convey any idea to you?
By that I mean particularly enlarged blood vessels. Great redness of the eyes, with lachrymation. burning eyeballs and vascular appearance.
This increased determination of blood is more or less painful; the eyeballs feel sore and ache; sharp, shooting pains in eyes.
In almost every rubric of Aesculus we shall find stitching and shooting; little twinges; wandering pains with fullness; almost every kind of disturbance will intensify e fullness.
Fullness of the hands and feet, not the fullness that pits upon pressure, that we call oedema, but a tenseness.
Medicines having much trouble with the veins are often disturbed by hot bathing, weakness after a hot bath, weakness in warm weather, aversion to heat and desire for cold.
It is the state of Pulsatilla. The Pulsatilla veins contract in cold weather, and the shrivelling up makes the patient feel better, but the veins fill and become engorged in the warm air and after a hot bath.
A tepid bath sometimes makes a Pulsatilla patient feel better, but a Turkish bath is generally distressing. Many of the complaints of Aesculus are of this sort; Aesculus often feels better in cold air.
The symptoms of Aesculus are often brought out, by temperature, especially the little stinging pains. It is characteristic of these superficial pains that they are nearly always ameliorated by heat, while the deeper affections are oftentimes ameliorated from cold.
Now, in Pulsatilla, the stinging pains of the scalp and those over the body, here and there, are often ameliorated by the local application of heat, while the patient himself wants to, be in the cold; in the same way Aesculus stinging pains are better from heat, while the patient is often better from cold, although at times he is aggravated from cold, damp weather in rheumatic and venous conditions.
Again, in Secale, we see that the little sharp pains that follow the course of the nerves are better from beat, but the patient himself wants to be in the cold air, or to be uncovered, except the spot of pain, which he wants kept warm.
We notice the same thing running through Camphorg; during the twinges of pain he wants the windows closed and wants hot applications; but as soon as the pain is over he wants the windows up and desires to be uncovered so that he can breathe. These are general things, things that are to be observed in analyzing symptoms.
Aesculus then is a venous remedy, engorged and full, sometimes to bursting. Now, there is another feature I want to bring out. You will notice where congestion takes place that it is purple or blue in color.
Throat: This remedy produces inflammation of the throat, the characteristic being that it is very dark. It has the tendency to produce varicose veins and ulceration, and round about these we have marked duskiness.
Aesculus cures varicose leg ulcers with a purplish areola.
When we study the hemorrhoidal state we see the tumor is purple, looking almost as if it would slough. The remedy is not active in its inflammatory state, it is sluggish and passive.
Certain remedies produce a slight inflammation with a high degree of redness, everything is violent and rapid, but in this medicine things are slow; the activities are reduced, the heart is laboring and the veins are congested.
Stomach, Digestion:
"Eructations: sour, greasy, bitter."
"Desire to vomit."
"Heartburn and gulping up of food after eating."
It has a great disturbance of digestion, and we can see by these symptoms that we must class it with Phosphorus and Ferrum.
As soon as the patient has swallowed the food, or a little while after, it becomes sour and he eructates it, until after a while he has emptied the stomach of its contents.
Such is the state of Phosphorus, Ferrum, Arsenicum, Aesculus and a few other medicines. Aesculus has also a state of congestion and ulceration of the stomach.
"Constant distress and burning in the stomach. Inclination to vomit."
Such a state as this might be present in ulceration of the stomach. Abdomen: The abdomen is full of troubles.
If we read the symptoms of the right hypochondrium, of the abdomen and of the rectum, we shall see from the study of these that there must be a marked portal stasis.
Digestion is slow, the bowels are constipated and there is protrusion of the rectum when at stool. It has most troublesome hemorrhoids with fullness of the right hypochondrium.
The liver is full of suffering. After eating there is distress in the bowels and rectum. Sticking, jagging, burning pains, as if the rectum were full of sticks.
Great suffering with blind hemorrhoids. The hemorrhoidal veins are all distended and ulcerate. The stool becomes jammed into the rectum, against these distended veins, and then ulceration takes place with bleeding and great suffering.
This remedy is often supposed to be suitable to hemorrhoids that do not bleed, but it cures bleeding piles also. We find in the text over two pages devoted to the symptoms of the rectum. Great soreness; much pain; urging to stool; dark stool followed by white one, showing the liver engorgement. Chronic constipation.
Back: The back is the seat of much trouble, especially low down in the back, through the sacrum and hips; although there is also aching all along the back and pain in the back of the neck.
It is a very common thing for patients suffering from hemorrhoids to have pain in the back of the neck and base of the brain, basilar headaches, and when these hemorrhoidal patients undertake to walk they have pain and aching across the sacrum into the hips.
This pain through the sacrum and into the hips, when walking, is a striking feature of Aesculus, so striking that you may expect it to be present even when there are no hemorrhoids.
Constant dull backache; walking is almost impossible; scarcely able to rise or walk after sitting. You will see
one suffering from the Aesculus backache, on attempting to rise from sitting, make many painful efforts before he finally succeeds. This is found in Sulphur, Petroleum and is also cured by Agaricus.
Genital female: Aesculus is indicated oftentimes in the troubles of women, with great dragging pain in the pelvis. Many a time has Aesculus cured the dragging-down pain of the pelvis with copious leucorrhoea and pressing pain in the hips when walking.
The woman feels that the uterus is engorged. She says that the lower part of the abdomen feels full, both before and during menstruation. There is much suffering at this time with pains in the hips.
"Uterine soreness, with throbbing in the hypogastrium." "Old cases of leucorrhoea, discharge of a dark yellow color, thick and sticky." "Leucorrhoea, with lameness in the back across sacro iliac articulations."
During pregnancy there are many complaints, with soreness and fullness and uneasy consciousness of the uterus and pain across the back when walking.
Aesculus is full of gouty sufferings; gout in all the joints, gouty rheumatic affections, neuralgic affections. Especially in this rheumatic tendency found from the elbows to the hands, in the forearm and hands. Rending, tearing pains, flying hither and thither without any particular order, relieved by heat.
Varicose veins of the thighs and legs have been cured by Aesculus (Fluoric acid). This varicose tendency in the body we have already seen is a striking feature of Aesculus.
After the sore throat has passed away, engorged veins are left, which Aesculus sometimes cures. After eye troubles have been cured, varicose veins - remain in the eye.
With rheumatic complaints there are varicose veins. It is one of the most frequently indicated remedies in the hemorrhoidal constitution, as it used to be called.
Aethusa Cynapium
Generalities: Before Aethusa was known a certain class of cases of cholera infantum, and vomiting and diarrhea in children, all resulted fatally, because there was no remedy that looked like such serious cases.
Death is stamped on the face from the beginning, and if there are any remedies in the book that save life this is one of them.
It applies to the cases that come on very suddenly in hot weather in infancy, with extreme prostration.
The mother does not suspect the child is sick until she takes it from the crib; only a few hours before it was well; but when cholera infantum is prevalent in hot weather, this little one fills its stomach with milk and almost before it has had time to coagulate or form into curds the milk comes up partly in curds and partly liquid, and accompanying the vomiting there is a thin, yellow greenish, slimy stool.
The child has the appearance as if it were dying, pale Hippocratic face, there is a whitish-blue pallor around the lips, the eyes are sunken and there is a sunken condition around the nose. The mother is astonished and sends for the doctor hurriedly. The child sinks into an exhausted sleep.
It wakes up and again fills the stomach with milk which comes up again in a few minutes, partly in curd and partly liquid, and again there is the awful exhaustion, deathly appearance and prolonged sleep.
Without Aethusa, in two or three days the undertaker gets that child. That is pretty nearly the whole story of Aethusa.
It has delirium, it has excitement, it has mental disturbances of various kinds, but they are acute and accompany the brain troubles.
A certain class of infants come down sick in the hot weather, in the hot nights, and they get brain trouble, and from that time the stomach quits business, the bowels become relaxed, and everything put into the stomach either comes up or goes right through.
This occurs especially in those infants that have been fed as the ordinary everyday mother feeds her baby and how is that?
Every time it cries she puts it to the breast or feeds it. Well, now; let us think a bit. Every doctor ought to think a little, once in a while. Now meditate a trifle as to whether that is a wise or foolish thing to do.
It takes about two hours or two hours and a half for the ordinary baby's stomach to transact good wholesome business in digesting the milk taken, and it ought to have a rest of half an hour or so, and when we get up to three hours and the baby cries then it is probably hungry and will be glad to take some more and digest it.
Any shorter interval of feeding than that is bad practice, it would be just the same thing if the child should take half teacupful of milk and let it partly digest, and in a little while take little more, and then later add a little more.
It commences to spit up its food and it is sour, and the very first spell of hot weather that comes brings on head trouble. Only the toughest children will stand this bad method.
I have watched these children and seen them stand it until the summer. The doctor must put his foot down, and put it down violently, and make them see he means it.
The old woman comes in and says: "That doctor does not know anything" and the baby must be fed.
Now Aethusa suits improperly fed babies. It is at the head of the list of medicines for that condition; that is, when digestion has absolutely ceased from brain trouble.
Stomach and digestion: So far as busy doctors have discovered the call for this remedy, it has been mostly among babies, but adults sometimes take on an Aethusa state, when digestion has absolutely ceased from brain trouble and from excitement.
It has cured dyspepsia from constant feeding, in those nibblers, those hungry fellows who are always eating, always nibbling, always taking crackers in their pockets until there comes a time when the stomach ceases to act.
It also suits cases of indigestion from head troubles, with hot head, vomiting, exhaustion, sweat and long sleep.
Convulsions: Aethusa has convulsions in children.
Sometimes the brain trouble does not affect the stomach, but the child goes into convulsions, with clammy hands, deathly countenance, and the sweat, exhaustion and sleep.
"Convulsions, great weakness and prostration, with sleepiness. Dosing of the child after vomiting and after stool, with convulsions."
In the Aethusa patient there is much in the face and aspect to indicate a remedy; so much can be seen and comes within the observation, and so little questioning is necessary, that a sort of snap-shot prescribing can be done, but it is not to be recommended.
A busy physician, one who really and truly studies his Materia Medica, learned the principles, will in time do a great deal of what seems to be snap-shot prescribing, but he really does not do so, because he puts
together many things that outsiders would not think of.
Aethusa then shows itself upon the surface, whereas in many remedies there is nothing seen upon the surface because they manifest themselves in any or deeper sensations.
Let me lay a case before you to illustrate this. For instance, take a robust looking fellow, who declares himself fairly well, out to lunch with you.
You have noticed for some time that his nose is all the time peeling off at once there is a star. He never talks about his health. Pretty soon, while lunching, the door slams and he jumps. That is the second point. Then he tells you how
much he eats, how well it affects him, how good he feels after eating, and you have noticed yourself that he eats a good deal.
You have not said one word about his health to him. You have not asked him to tell you any symptoms. Finally you shove the pitcher of milk over to him, and he says:
"Oh, I can't drink milk; if I take milk it gives me diarrhoea; I never think of taking it." Who could not prescribe for that fellow without taking him into the office? Who would think of anything but Natrum carb. for such a case?
Sometimes you can find out the whole story by getting a stubborn patient to go and dine with you.
Agaricus Muscarius
Generalities: The most striking things running through this medicine are twitchings and tremblings, jerkings of the muscles and trembling of the limbs; quivering and tremors, everywhere these two features are present in all parts of the body and limbs.
The twitching of the muscles becomes so extensive that it is a well-developed case of chorea. It has in its nature all that is found in chorea and has cured many cases. This is a general belonging to all parts to all muscles.
Throughout the body there is a sensation of creeping and crawling. It is hardly confined to the skin, it is felt as if in the flesh, a sensation as if of ants.
Itching of the skin all over which changes place from scratching. No place is exempt from this. There are strange sensations here and there upon the skin or in parts, cold sensations, sensations of cold needles and of hot needles; stinging and burning where the circulation is feeble, about the ears, nose, back of hands and fingers and toes, red spots with itching and burning as if frostbitten. It is a great remedy for chilblains.
The patient is extremely nervous and sensitive to cold. Itching, pricking, tingling, etc., come on from mental exertion and are relieved from physical exertion.
All the symptoms of Agaricus are also aggravated after sexual intercourse, especially in the symptoms of the spinal cord. It is useful for the symptoms which come on after coition in young, nervous married women, hysterical fainting after coition.
Mind: The mental symptoms are such as you would expect.
Great changeability, irritability, mental depression and complaints which come on from overexertion of the mind and prolonged study. The brain seems to be developed tardily.
Children are late in learning to talk and walk, thus combining the features of two remedies, Natrum muriaticum, which has the symptom "late learning to talk," and Calcarea carb., which has the symptom "late learning to walk."
It will be noticed in Calcarea that this is due to a defect in bone weakness. In Agaricus it is a mental defect, a slowly developing mind.
Children with twitching and early fainting, nervous girls prior to puberty who have convulsions from being scolded, from excitement and shock; late in mental development.
Children who cannot remember, make mistakes and are slow in learning. Nervous patients who on going over their manuscripts find out their mistakes in writing and spelling.
The condition of the mind is one in which they are slow to grasp ideas; wrong words float in kaleidoscopically.
When we read in the book "the whole psychological sphere as if paralyzed," we must read between the lines.
The whole mind and sensorium seem paralyzed; the patient is sluggish, stupid, at times seems to be delirious; there is confusion of the mind so nearly like delirium that it is not unlike intoxication.
A delirium such as is produced by alcohol. He also becomes silly, says foolish and silly things, sings and whistles at an inopportune time, makes verses and prophesies; or he lapses into an opposite state, becomes indifferent to Ids surroundings. One who is mild and placid becomes self-willed, obstinate and conceited.
Difficulty in coordinating the movements of the muscles of the body. Incoordination of brain and spinal cord. Clumsy motion of the fingers and hands. In handling things she drops them. Fingers fly open spasmodically while holding things.
You will sometimes cure Bridget in the kitchen with Agaricus or Apis, when the trouble is that she is continually breaking the dishes by letting them fall. These two remedies are opposites,
Agaricus must stay near the fire, while Apis she wants to get out of the kitchen. The awkwardness, clumsiness, etc., are both mental and bodily.
Every sort of change is rung on the patient and the doctor. At times the patient is stupid, awkward and clumsy, at other times quick and poetical, can run off poetry without effort, especially at night.
In the morning he is tired and sluggish and this may last till noon. The mental symptoms are worse in the morning and are relieved towards evening.
All jerkings and twitchings subside during sleep. There is vertigo when walking in the open air. He is always chilly. On undertaking to do something he does the opposite. Vertigo and confusion of mind are mixed up.
Head: It is a common feature for the headaches of this remedy to be associated with the spinal symptoms, the quivering and jerking.
Headaches in spinal patients. Pain as though sharp ice touched the head, or as if from cold needles. - That is general; we find it in other parts.
Pain in the head as if from a nail. There is some bleeding in the morning, and the blood is thick, black and will hardly drop. Coldness in the head.
In the scalp there are all sorts of queer sensations; icy coldness after itching or scratching. That runs all through the body. There is itching, although no eruption is visible; can't let it alone, and after scratching there is a sensation of icy coldness in the part or as if the wind was blowing on it.
The head is in constant motion as in chorea. Itching of the scalp, especially in the morning on rising.
There again we have the general aggravation in the morning. There are marked eruptions on the scalp. Eczema with crusts.
Eyes: Twitching and jerking of the eyes.
You will observe this about the Agaricus eyes; as the patient looks at you there is a pendulum like action of the eyes, they go back and forth all the time; they oscillate, though he tries his best to fix his look on you.
This stops only during sleep; all the motions subside during sleep. A few other medicines have cured this eye symptom, Cicuta, Arsenicum, Sulphur, Pulsatilla, but Agaricus also produces and cures it.
There is every conceivable kind of deception in colors and in vision. Flickering before the eyes; he reads with difficulty. Objects seem to be where they are not. Black flies before the eyes; black motes; sees double; floating flies before the eyes.
Muscular weakness of the eyes. Irregularity of the motions of the eyes; pupils dilated; pupils contracted. Sensation as of a mist or cobweb before the eyes. Spasmodic twitching and jerking. The jerkings and twitchings are the most marked symptoms, as also the choreic movements about the eyes, and the deceptions in colors and figures before the eyes.
Ears: Redness, burning and itching of the ears as if they had been frostbitten.
The sensation as of chilblains, the same sensation as found throughout; the same itching and tingling as of the remedy in general. Dullness of hearing. Deafness. Hearing acute. in the morning he is dumb, sluggish, stupid, tired, but when evening comes he brightens up, becomes warmed up, becomes excited, poetical and prophetical, wants to sit up late at night, is brilliant, wants to play games.
Nose: Nosebleed; profuse, foetid discharge from the nose.
Agaricus will cure the most inveterate chronic catarrhs with dryness and crusts, in tubercular constitutions, so deep-seated is it.
It has cured many cases of incipient phthisis. It cures old coughs and catarrhs. Red nose, as if frostbitten. It is as good as Ledum and Lachesis for the red-tipped nose in old drunkards.
Face: From what we have already seen we expect twitching of the muscles of the face, and itching and redness and burning as if frostbitten, paralytic weakness, etc., because these are general features, and just as we expect we see these things in the text.
Choreic spasms. Expression as of idiocy. Now notice this: some patients when going on with their own usual vocation are pretty smart, but if you put some new idea before them, something not in the routine of their work, they are perfectly idiotic.
This is especially noticeable in the morning. He can't take in anything new in the morning, but he is able to take in new ideas and is bright in the evening, like the effect produced by tea and coffee and alcoholic beverages.
This remedy is a great antidote to alcoholic beverages. In this remedy and in Zincum the spine is affected and both of these have aggravation from stimulants.
Agaricus has cured many cases of epileptiform convulsions, more commonly the hystero-epileptic type with frothing of the mouth, opisthotonos, drawing of the muscles of the face.
The Agaricus patient has spells in which a little muscle of the face or a few fibres of a muscle will quiver for a few minutes and stop, and then in another part of the face the same thing, an eyelid will quiver, and then another set of fibres, sometimes so bad as to nearly drive him crazy. Such is an Agaricus state as well as Nux vomica.
Mouth: The teeth feel too long and are sensitive to touch. The tongue quivers, twitches, jerks and causes disorderly speech; articulates violently.
Tongue, dry, tremulous. Learns to speak with difficulty. Spasms of the tongue, inarticulate speech. Phagedenic ulcer on the fraenum of the tongue; eats it away. Soreness of the tongue. Mercurial aphthae in roof of mouth. Little white blisters like nursing sore mouth. Chronic sore throat. Induration of tonsils. Burning thirst, ravenous appetite. Gnawing in stomach as if from hunger, without desire for food.
Abdomen: Flatus; distressing belching; great tympanites; rumbling; turmoil in abdomen; offensive flatus; rumbling and gurgling in belly. Everything ferments; rumbling and loud rolling; pinching colic. Horribly foetid discharge. Tympanitic condition marked in typhoid; low type of typhoid; trembling and jerking of muscles; paralytic weakness; emaciation; mental symptoms.
Morning diarrhea, great deal of hot flatus (Aloe), with burning in the rectum; soft stool, great tenesmus; urging to stool violent; involuntary straining before, during and after stool.
Sensation as if rectum would burst, even after stool (Merc. and Sul.). Violent, sudden pains; can't wait; distressing, bursting sensation.
Before stool, cutting and pinching in abdomen; urgent tenesmus; painful straining in rectum.
During stool, colic and passing of flatus; burning, soreness, smarting and cutting in anus; sweat; pain in loins to legs, continuing after stool.
After stool, headache relieved; biting in anus; straining in rectum; cutting pain in anus; griping in hypogastrium; distension in abdomen; heaviness in abdomen and around navel; pain in chest. Emphasize the tenesmus after stool.
May have constipation and paralytic feelings of the rectum; stool hard; straining at stool as if life depended on it and yet no stool.
Beginning paralysis of the lower limbs, with twitching of the muscles and burning spine. In one case, after straining had been given up as unsuccessful would pass a stool involuntarily.
This symptom only was known in Arg. n. (stool and urine). Desire to urinate as urgent as the desire for stool. Dribbling of urine. A peculiar feature of this remedy is that the urine feels cold on passing; while the urine dribbles, can count the cold drops along the urethra.
Urines: "Urine passes slowly in a stream or in drops, has to press to promote the flow."
"Urine watery, clear, lemon-colored, bright yellow; dark yellow and, hot; red, flocculent, a powdery sediment; watery in the forenoon, in the afternoon milky, like whey, with a red or white sediment (phosphate of magnesia); iridizing on surface."
Phosphates; milky urine. Oily surface, iridescent surface, greasy-like pellicle on urine, like petroleum.
Scanty urine in rheumatic, gouty, hysterical subjects. Persons cold, feeble, pale, going into phthisis. Urine becomes scanty and a headache comes on. Goes many days and is constipated, and headache relieved by stool. In Fluoric acid, if he does not attend to the desire to urinate, a headache comes on.
Genitals: Transformation takes place. The milk ceases in one day, but congestion of the brain or spine comes on. Metastasis, especially if milk ceases and complaints come on.
Genital organs cold and shrunken.
The comparative examination of the symptoms of male and female sexual organs shows that the proving has not been extensively made on the female, but in the male there are many symptoms which have an analogous condition in the female.
In the male, symptoms are worse after coition, but just as marked in the female. Complaints after sexual excitement, debauch, etc., in the woman, fainting; in the man, weakness.
The trembling and twitching, or any of the Agaricus symptoms may be worse after coition, because the sexual functions are related to the cord. Those suffering from spinal affections have distress after this act.
In the male, during coition, burning in the urethra comes from excoriation or a sense of hotness of the seminal fluid while being ejected, and hence can only be a symptom of the male.
Burning in the prostate during ejaculation. Violent sexual excitement before and during, but at the time of ejaculation the orgasm is wanting, it is a passive and pleasure less ejaculation.
This occurs in men with spinal weakness, nervous men who have tingling and crawling all over. It comes in the cure of old catarrhal discharge from the urethra, chronic gonorrhea, gleet, after all sorts of local treatment have been used.
The penis is cold and shrunken; excessively painful retraction in testes. In old gleety discharge where there is a continued itching tingling in the urethra and the last drop will remain, discharging for a long time.
There are two remedies better for this than many others, Petroleum and Agaricus.
The routine prescriber always thinks of Puls., Sep., etc., for bearing-down pains in the female, but ina woman with spinal irritation, etc., with the dragging-down sensation as if the parts would drop into the world, this remedy is the best.
Female: Those slender, nervous, restless women with tingling and creeping, must have Agaricus.
During menses, headache, toothache, etc. All the general symptoms are worse during the menstrual period, not to any great extent before or after. Aggravation of the heart symptoms and prolapsus just at the close of the menses.
Leucorrhoea very profuse, dark, bloody, acrid, excoriating in parts. This remedy has been mentioned in relation to Fluoric acid. There are many points of relation.
They are like each other in the leucorrhoea especially, copious and acrid, so acrid that it keeps the parts raw and irritated around the genitals and the patient can't walk.
In Fluoric acid there is, with the nervous symptoms, headache ameliorated by passing the urine, or headache if urination is not immediately attended to, with copious, acrid, excoriating leucorrhoea.
Chest: Agaricus is a great remedy in chest troubles, though seldom thought of. It has cured what seemed to be consumption. Catarrhal condition of the chest, with-night sweats and history of the nervous symptoms.
Violent cough in isolated attacks ending in sneezing. Convulsive cough, with sweat towards evening, with frequent pulse, expectoration of pus-like mucus, worse in the mornings and when lying on the back. Add to this the symptoms of Agaricus as described, and Agaricus will take hold of that case.
Cases of incipient, phthisis. It closely relates to the tubercular diathesis.
I remember starting out to prove Tuberculinum on an individual I suspected would be sensitive to it from his history and symptoms. The first dose almost killed him, and, considering the use that that substance is put to in diagnosing the disease in cattle, it seemed to stir him up.
He became emaciated and looked as if he would die. I let it alone and watched and waited patiently and the symptoms of Agaricus came up and established the relationship between these two remedies, and confirmed Hering's observation of the relationship of Agaricus to the tubercular diathesis. Agaricus cured him and fattened him up.
Heart: The remedy is full of nervous palpitation; worse in the evening. It cures shocks and thrills in the heart; spasms of the heart; internal manifestations of its jerking symptoms.
These shocks come from sudden noise; from eructations; on coughing; when lying on the left side or back; worse at night; during fever; they often extend to other parts, as to abdomen or back or limbs. On the outer chest there is tingling and creeping as in general.
Back: The back has many peculiar and general guiding symptoms. Stiffness of the whole spine. Feeling as if it would break when he attempts to bend. Feels as if something is so tight that it will break when he stoops. Tightness in the muscles of the back. Tingling deep in the spine.
Violent, shooting, burning pains. Pain along the spine, worse by stooping. Pains of all sorts in the spine. Pains go up the back and down the back. Sensitiveness of the spine to touch, especially in the back of the peck and dorsal region between the scapulae.
Sensitive to a hot sponge in the lumbar region in spinal irritation. Sensation as if cold air were spreading along the back like an aura epileptica.
Sensation of ice touching the body. Cold spots. Chilliness over the back, crawling, creeping and formication. Numbness of skin over the back.
The most of the pains are in the back of the neck and the lumbo-sacral region. Pains in this region in connection with coition. Pain in the lumbar region and sacral region, especially during exertion, sitting, etc. Pain in the sacrum as if beaten, as if it would break. Pains below the waist in women.
Limbs: In the limbs in general there are twitchings; they are numb, choreic; burning here and there; cold feelings in spots, paralyzed. Trembling of limbs, hands, awkwardness of all the movements. Rheumatism and gout of joints. Paralysis of the lower limbs. Trembling and weakness of the lower limbs.
Burning itching of the hands as if frozen. In the smaller joints, where the circulation is feeble, there are frostbite symptoms. Toes and fingers stiff.
Bones feel as if they would break during rest, especially in the lower limbs. Feeling as if the tibia would break. Aching in the tibia. Growing pains in children and they must sit at the fire or the extremities will get
cold. Pains in the bones. Weight in the legs. Pains in the lower limbs; aching; stitching; tearing; better from warmth and from motion.
Paralytic weakness in the lower limbs soon after becoming pregnant. This comes with every pregnancy and she must go to bed. The symptoms may lead to Agaricus. Weight in the legs. Legs feel heavy. Trembling and jerking motion in the lower limbs.
Agnus Castus
This wonderful remedy is often overlooked. It should come to mind for old sufferers who are broken from sexual excesses and secret vice.
The pale sickly and sad mortals who lament over their misspent life. It is good for both sexes. Sexual: Sexual weakness; relaxation of parts. Perversion of all the functions.
A woman who indulged extensively in secret vice, found after marriage that she had no sexual thrill, was cured by this remedy.
Later she was confined and no milk came in her mammae, again Agnus started the belated milk at the end of three weeks.
When the milk ceases after it has started, or becomes scanty when the above history is known, and the woman is said, this remedy will, if not opposed, most likely cure.
It cures uterine haemorrhage, and restores suppressed menses in young women with a history. The vagina is much relaxed, there is often prolapsus, and there is a copious white-of-egg-like leucorrhoea.
But the pitiful, woebegone young man, heart-broken over his early life, now finds himself newly married, and impotent.
He has had gonorrhoea; he has lived in excesses, and now suffers from relaxed and cold genitalia, emissions, prostatic discharge at stool.
His young and beautiful wife excites no erection, though only recently he had a clandestine success, and he has morning erections but no more.
Out of the above cause and condition come many distressing symptoms.
Mind: Loss of memory, despair, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, fear and peevishness. These patients suffer from headaches, photophobia and nervous symptoms too numerous to mention. Formication of the skin.
Tearing pains of head, face and teeth. All but the simplest food disorders the stomach, and he complains much of nausea. His muscles are flabby.
He is anemic, and his glands are enlarged, especially, the spleen. lie is growing increasingly flatulent.
The abdominal viscera hang down as a weight. There is a growing weakness of the rectum and constipation, and he presses hard at stool, which often fails and slips back, like Silica, Sanic and Thuja.
The stool is large and hard. Itching, smarting at the anus, noisy flatus of a urinous odor. Excoriated anus. He soon takes on a hacking cough and night sweats.
The limbs are tired and cold. He is sensitive to cold, and wants to remain quiet. Exertion and motion intensify his complaints.
He has been to many advisers, and they have told him he has Neurasthenia. He must have Agnus castus.
Ailanthus Glandulosa
Generalities: This medicine is especially suitable in the low zymotic forms of sickness, such as we find in diphtheria and scarlet fever, in blood poisoning and in symptomatic typhoids, especially those cases that are characterized by capillary congestion in spots, red mottled spots.
Scarlet: Perhaps the most striking manifestation of such a low type of sickness is malignant scarlet fever. The regular rash does not come out, but in its place red spots, roseola-like, make their appearance; the usual uniform spread of the eruption has failed, or has been suppressed, and there is bleeding from the gums and nose, and dreadful tumefaction in the throat.
The countenance is purple and besotted, the eyes are congested and there is even bleeding from the eyes. There is an appearance of great prostration, but it is really stupefaction; he seems stupid and benumbed.
If you look at the throat you see it is covered with little purple patches, intermingled with an oedematous appearance similar to that found in Baptisia. It is a low depressed type of sickness.
De composition of the blood is going on rapidly. The blood that oozes is black. The child is going into a state of stupor and it is with difficulty that he can be aroused. Sometimes blisters are formed on the ends of fingers, or here and there over the body. From the mouth and nose come foetid odors. The child is going as rapidly as possible into a form of malignant disease.
Sometimes the disease comes on as a light febrile attack, but from taking cold and suppressing some of the natural manifestations the case takes on a low typhoid form and whereas you had at first only a simple remittent, the case has now assumed a state of prostration with a very rapid heart, foetor, purpleness or blueness, a passive congestion with purple blotches of the skin, causing a mottled appearance.
When a disease turns so suddenly blood poisoning is going on and a symptomatic typhoid state appears. A remittent that turns into a sharp zymotic state in the course of twenty-four hours, a diphtheria that takes on this form with stupidity and mottled skin are examples of such a type of sickness.
Mind: The mental symptoms accompanying this state are interesting. I read from some nows I have made. A continued dreamy state of mind though awake. Child cries all the time. Sees little animals like rats running around.
Feels a rat or something small crawling up the limb and over the body. There seems to be constant loss of memory, even the things spoken of a moment ago go right out of the mind. Constant forgetfulness. All past events are forgotten. Past events are forgotten or remembered as belonging to someone else, or as matters read.
That is in keeping with the dreamy state, it seems as though those things that are past appear as in a dream, as if he had dreamed them. Cannot concentrate the mind in any mental effort; cannot answer questions correctly; is as if in a semi-conscious state, and finally he goes into complete unconsciousness.
There is in the earlier stages of this zymotic state great anxiety and restlessness, later there is stupor and indifference to everything. Continual sighing with depression of spirits; extremely irritable, semi-conscious, finally unconsciousness, stupor, delirium and insensibility; muttering delirium with sleeplessness and restlessness.
This mental state is such as occurs in zymotic sickness; the chronic illness has not been well brought out. Dr. Wells used this remedy in a number of cases, as it was at that time an epidemic remedy for scarlet fever, in Brooklyn, and many patients were saved by it. It seemed to be able to change the character of the malignant forms of scarlet fever into a mild type.
Face: In addition to the symptoms of the text it has been observed that the hair falls out and flashes of light play before the eyes on closing the lids at night.
"Pupils widely dilated; copious, thin, ichorous and bloody, discharge from the nose." That is in the zymotic states in scarlet fever.
"Nostrils congested. Great prostration and a countenance indicating much distress. Face dark as mahogany."
That is in suppressed scarlet fever. Purple, bloated and puffed, besotted face. This remedy is one not very much used, and it is not very often indicated, but it is very useful when indicated. You will not very often see this particular type even in malignant scarlet fever. You will often see such a scarlet fever running to a number of other remedies, but this remedy corresponds to one of the most malignant types, and its commonest use will be in an epidemic in which the cases largely run to the malignant type.
There are three common types of scarlet fever. In one season you find the cases are mild and simple, the typical eruption is present and comes on speedily without any great amount of fever. Such cases will often run their course with good nursing, a warm room and plenty of clothing without much medicine.
Skin: The skin is bright red, smooth and shiny. The case is not serious. In other epidemics you will find only an isolated case of this kind, while the majority of cases present marked trouble in the throat; the rash is scanty when present, and congestion of the head and spinal symptoms come on with pain in the back of the neck.
Throat: The throat is dreadfully swollen and inflamed, bright red and very painful. Then there is a third type in which the throat is severely swollen, all the mucous membranes are swollen, and the whole tendency is toward ad poisoning or zymosis with enlargement of the glands, puffiness of the skin and a great deal of fetor; the skin is dusky and the eruption is scanty, sometimes hardly visible from beginning to end.
These cases will almost all die if let alone; they are very serious. The old authors call these three forms "scarlatina simplex, scarlatina anginosa," and "scarlatin. maligna."
In some epidemics you will see all three of the appearances; in some families you will see two forms.
One child will have a mild in type, and another will have it more severely with zymotic blisters here and there, on the ends of the fingers, and these will be attended with foetor; as soon as the blisters break ulceration will take place if the child live long enough; but these are the deadly cases, the malignant type.
Even when the rash does not come out in the low forms of scarlet fever, the impression of the finger makes a white mark which will be slow to fill up. The more marked that is, the lower the type. The more zymotic the type the more sluggish the circulation, and in this remedy especially is this state present.
The congested condition of the skin is present even when there is no rash, a passive congestion of the veins.
Quite a number of medicines have that, but Veratrum viride produces such a vaso-motor paralysis that a line upon the skin made by pressure will remain a long time. In all these zymotic complaints there is a foetid odor that is sometimes cadaveric, sometimes like stinking meat; this will be found in the low types of disease where this remedy is indicated.
"Throat much swollen, dark red, almost purple in color. Diphtheria with extreme prostration. Throat livid, swollen; tonsils prominent and studded with deep ulcers."
The throat and tonsils very often appear as if they would pit upon pressure like a dropsical state. In some of these zymotic cases where a reaction ought to take place a diarrhea sets in that is horribly offensive; a critical diarrhea. With these zymotic states there is pain in the back of the neck and head no matter what the name of the disease is.
"Breathing hurried, irregular, heavy. Burning in the palms and soles, hunts to find a cool place to put them. Feels a rat running up the leg. Feeling as if a snake crawled up the leg."
These mental symptoms occurred in one of my provers. In low, adynamic forms of disease characterized by sudden and extreme prostration,
"Vomiting, pulse small and rapid purplish appearance of skin."
"Electric thrill from brain to extremities." "Chill at 8 A.M. with chill, heat and sweat."
During the chill vomiting of food and piercing pain over the hip. Chill is preceded by malignant eruption, especially on the face and forehead.
"During chill hunger, empty feeling, intolerable pain in back of neck, upper part of back and hip joint."
That pain in the back of the neck is a common forerunner of low types of fever. It generally precedes a congestive attack of great violence characterized by fullness of the head with heat.
Skin: This miliary rash spoken of in the text, looking like measles, is when the scarlet fever rash or the measles rash does not come out in its uniform fashion, but in patches, little circles here and there and is dark.
"Irregular, patchy, livid eruption, disappearing on pressure and return ing very slowly; interspersed with small vesicles, worse on forehead, head, neck and chest. Eruption appeared scantily for two days with sore throat and mild fever" .
This eruption is like the petechiae that we see, in typhoid forms of disease. The record of this remedy in scarlet fever makes it worthy of further study; it ought to be reproved that we may have a fuller understanding of it.
"Eruption plentiful, of a bluish tint. Typhoid scarlatina."
"Eruption is slow to make its appearance, remains livid."
"Body and limbs covered with an irregular patchy eruption of a very livid color."
Here you see but one type of scarlet fever. This low type of fever sometimes needs Sulphur or Phosphorus, or Belladonna, or Baptisia, or Lachesis. That you may be able to distinguish one from the other and keep the picture of each remedy clearly in mind requires a prolonged study of the Materia Medica.
It is an easy matter to compare remedies for yourself after you have first studied each one separately.
You can then bring out many comparisons, and especially in this case at the bed side. If you go to the bedside with a good knowledge of the generals of Materia Medica you will be surprised at the number of
symptom pictures which will come into your mind, called up by the signs of the sickness.
When you go to the bedside of scarlet fever you should not call to mind the names of these medicines you may have heard recommended for scarlet fever; let the appearance of the patient bring to mind such remedies as appear like this patient, regardless of whether they have been associated with scarlet fever or not.
When you see the rash perhaps you will say that looks like an Aconite rash but there is such scanty zymosis in the nature of Aconite that it is no longer thought of.
Belladonna is not suitable, for in that remedy the rash is shiny and smooth, the typical Sydenham rash.
On the other hand, you will say Pulsatilla has a measly rash, and often associated with a low form of fever, but not so low as the typhoid type, so Pulsatilla goes out of your mind.
You now think of the remedies that are typical of all zymotic states; the prostration, the aggravation after sleep, general stupor and delirium, and almost at a glance you see Lachesis, the type of such forms of disease.
Its picture comes into your mind speedily. You see another case of scarlet fever where there is a scanty rash, the child before you keeps on picking the skin from the lips and nose, lies in a state of pallor and exhaustion, no rash to speak of, urine nearly suppressed; almost in a moment you think of Arum triph.
It is the aspect of things that will call the remedy to the mind. In another case you have all the purple appearance | have spoken of in this remedy; horrible foetor a good deal of sore throat, and the child cannot
get water cold enough, wants a stream of water running down the throat all the time; you may safely trust to Phosphorus.
In these low types of sickness there is always something to tell the story if you will only listen, study and wait long enough.
Allium Cepa
General features: Allium cepa is used principally for "colds."
There are various phases of these "colds," in the nose, in the throat, in the larynx, in the bronchial tubes. The patient and all the phases of his "cold," his coryza, his Ia laryngitis, his cough, all his complaints, are aggravated by warmth, are worse in a warm room, excepting the tickling in the larynx, which is sometimes
aggravated by drawing in cold air.
In this way the cou is sometimes excited by cold air but the patient himself is better in cold air and sensitive to heat.
Most of the symptoms are worse in the evening, the symptoms of coryza, the "cold," and the general symptoms.
These are symptoms most striking general features of Allium Cepa.
It is not strange that the old ladies used to bind onions on the ear for earache and around the neck for sore throats, for onion is very frequently indicated in almost every climate for the effects of cold.
Cold, damp, penetrating winds, in any climate, are likely to bring on Allium cepa complaints-coryza, Ia grippe, influenza or whatever they may be called, and usually there is congestive headache.
Coryza: Rawness in the nose, copious flow of water from the eyes, which is always bland; copious watery discharge from the nose, which is always excoriating.
Rawness in the larynx and throat, extending down into the chest. Raw in the nose. In twenty-four hours it reaches the larynx.
Cough, excited by tickling in the larynx and when lying down at night in a warm room. On going to bed in the evening Allium has its most troublesome aggravation.
I have heard patients describe the pain in the larynx on coughing, saying that it felt as if someone was reaching down with a hook at every cough.
Tearing in the larynx with every cough. Sneezing, rawness of all the mucous membranes and that tearing cough, all symptoms worse in a warm room and in the even ing; it is astonishing how quickly the onion will break up that "cold."
Now we will take up the particulars of the coryza. Among the earlier symptoms will be the sneezing, which comes with increasing frequency. A watery discharge drips from the nose constantly, burns like fire, and excoriates the upper lip and the wings of the nose until there are rawness and redness.
Notice that the fluid from the nose is excoriating and the fluid from the eyes bland. Bear that in mind, for when we come to study Euphrasia we will find just the opposite.
We will find just such a watery discharge from the nose and such copious lachrymation; but the lachrymation is acrid and the discharge from the nose bland. The nasal discharge of Cepa fairly eats the hair off of the upper lip. And there is so much congestion that the patient has a sensation of fullness in the nose, with throbbing and burning, and sometimes nosebleed.
Pains through the jaws, in the face; and these pains extend into the head. Dull frontal headaches, occipital headaches; headaches very severe and the eyes cannot stand the light; tearing, bursting, throbbing in the head.
Now, there is another phase of this medicine. Why it begins the left side and goes over to the right nose, I do not know, but it usually does this.
Stuffing up of the side of the nose, watery, acrid discharge from the left side of the nose - in another twenty- four hours the right side is invaded.
"Profuse nasal discharge. Colds after damp north easterly winds."
That is, after damp, cold winds, for they may come from different directions in different localities. Fluent coryza with headache, tears from the eyes, want of appetite, cough and trembling in the open air.
"Every year in August, morning coryza, with violent sneezing, very sensitive to the odor of flowers and skin of peaches."
That is one form of hay fever cured by Allium cepa. It will wipe out an attack of hay fever in a few days, when the symptoms agree.
You may know that the true nature of hay fever is not generally understood. It is really only an explosion of chronic disease, that is, it is a manifestation of psora, and can be eradicated only by antipsoric treatment.
Many a time have I seen hay fever wiped out in one season by a short-acting remedy, only to return the next just the same, and perhaps another remedy will be required.
Psora: As soon as the hay fever is stopped you must begin with constitutional treatment. There will be symptoms, if you know how to hunt for them, that differ altogether from the acute attack. When the hay fever is on these do not appear.
It is a difficult matter to find a constitutional remedy when the hay fever is at its height, for it resembles an acute disease; but it is a manifestation of psora, like an other manifestation of psora, as eruptions, cough, etc.
The nose may manifest only a certain phase of chronic disease in one season which may, for instance, be suited to Allium cepa. I remember one time having occasion to prescribe Allium cepa at long distance. it was near a homoeopathic pharmacy. I wired the pharmacist to send my patient Allium cepa, and he labeled it.
Well, the patient kept the bottle and used it next season, but it did no good. That is likely to be the case, even when the symptoms seem to agree. In a psoric condition a short-acting remedy is insufficient; it may help for one day only, and the deep-acting remedy that includes the patient as well as the hay fever and all the other symptoms will have to be administered.
The best time to treat hay fever is after the acute attack subsides and until it begins again the next season. It will then occur in a greatly modified form, different from any the patient has ever had, and calling for a different remedy.
That will be the case if the constitutional remedy has been properly selected.
In these coryzas the inflammation soon spreads to the ears, the throat and the larynx.
Earache: The old mothers used to put onions on the baby's ear when it had earache. That is not surprising, when we see all the pains and aches belonging to this remedy. Jerking pains from the throat toward the Eustachian tube. Violent earache, even to the discharge of pus from the car. Ringing in the ears. Stitches towards the ear from the forehead. Pain like thick threads drawing from deep within the head. Stitching, tearing pains in the ear, with whooping cough, with coryza, with laryngitis.
In the household where a medicine case is kept, Pulsatilla is the standard remedy for earache, and it is true that only occasionally has a doctor to be sent for. Pulsatilla has such a strong affinity for the ear that it will cure earache in almost all sensitive children who cry pitifully. But those who are snappish, who are never suited, who will throw away something they have asked for and slap the nurse in the face must have Chamomilla.
With Pulsatilla, Chamomilla and Allium cepa you can cure the majority of earaches in children.
Eyes: Further, as to the eye-symptoms that accompany the Allium cepa colds, remember that the discharge from the eye is bland. Although there is burning in the eyes the tears do not excoriate as they flow down over the cheek. Profuse, bland lachrymation. Lachrymation in the evening in a warm room.
Colic: We all know what a flatulent vegetable the onion is. It is a wonderful medicine for babies with colic. Cutting, rending, tearing pains, drawing the poor little thing almost double. It screams with the violent cutting in the lower abdomen.
"Stitching pains in the abdomen."
"Colicky pains beginning in the hepatic region and spreading over the whole abdomen, worse around the navel; worse when sitting."
Wind colic. Allium cepa is a wonderful remedy in whooping cough, and when it is indicated the child will often have indigestion, vomiting and flatulency; will pass offensive flatus, will be doubled up with colic. Allium cepa also cures a ragged, sensitive condition of the anus, with bleeding, in infants.
Voice and larynx: Acute complaints of the voice; catarrhal hoarseness; copious expectoration of mucus from the larynx. Violent inflammation of the larynx coming on very rapidly, with that cough I spoke of, and the tearing in the larynx.
Some will describe it as a sensation as if something were being torn loose. Those who describe more accurately will say that it feels as if a hook were dragging up through the larynx with every cough.
Tickling in the larynx with hoarseness. In the whooping cough there is this same painfulness of the larynx. The child shakes and shudders and you can see that it dreads the cough because of the tearing pain in the larynx.
Cough and difficult breathing from inspiring cold-air, yet a warm draft will so increase the tickling that it is sure to set the patient coughing. So the cough is aggravated both by cold air and a warm room.
Colds sometimes travel down into the bronchial tubes and are attended with fever and rapid pulse. If the tickling in the larynx, the cough from inspiring the cold air, worse in a warm room and in the evening, with tearing pain in the larynx, are present, Allium cepa will cure.
The cough is spasmodic and resembles croup or whooping cough. Cepa has a record for croupy cough.
The old lady binds onion on the throat of the child with croup, and no doubt, out in the back woods, where there are no doctors, it was far better than Old School treatment.
Here is a fairly good description from the Guiding Symptoms:
"Hoarse, harsh, ringing, spasmodic cough, excited by constant tickling in the larynx; cough produces a raw, splitting pain in the larynx, so acute and so severe as to compel the patient to crouch from suffering and to make every effort to suppress the cough."
"Severe, laryngeal cough, which compels the patient to grasp the larynx; feels as if cough would tear it."
The child will reach up to the larynx and clutch it. This is wholly different from the Aconite condition, when the child, after exposure to a dry, cold wind, wakes before midnight with a hoarse, barking cough, and
clutches the larynx.
So Aconite cannot be substituted for Allium cepa.
Traumatic neuritis: Another affection over which this remedy has marvellous power is traumatic neuritis, often met with in a stump after amputation. The pains are almost unbearable, rapidly exhausting the strength of the patient.
Aloe
Generalities: Aloe, much like Aesculus, has a peculiar engorgement of the veins, causing stiffness and fullness throughout the body, but the greatest disturbance is in the veins of the portal system, with great fullness in the region of the liver, and abdominal, rectal and intestinal fullness.
This is associated with hemorrhoids. It has abdominal pains that drive him to stool like Nux vomica, cutting, cramping pains around the navel.
Pains about the navel that shoot down towards the rectum, cutting like knives. Dysenteric and diarrheic troubles. In the attacks of diarrhea there is gushing of thin, yellow, offensive, excoriating feces, which burn like fire, and the anus is sore.
Stools: He holds the stool with difficulty, does not dare take his mind off the sphincter because as soon as he does so the stool will escape. He cannot let the least quantity of flatus escape, because with it there will be a rush of faeces.
With the Aloe diarrhea the abdomen is distended with gas, causing a feeling of fullness and tightness, and he must go often to stool. Little ones, soon after they begin to walk, will drop all over the carpet, involuntarily, little yellow drops of mucus and faeces. The mother sometimes punishes the little ones, but they cannot help it, they cannot hold the stool, as it is passed involuntarily.
There is a lack of control of the sphincter. This state is not always confined to diarrhea, because sometimes children will go around dropping, involuntarily, little, hard, round marble-like pieces of stool. They do not even know the stool has passed. There is relaxation about the rectum and protrusion of the anus, with bleeding piles. Every mouthful of food hurries him to stool; drinking water will often hurry him to stool.
Diarrhoea from eating oysters out of season. You might be disposed to give Lycopodium because in the text books poisoning from oysters is laid down under Lyc. I do not know that you would be justified in saying poisoning from oysters in season is Lyc., and out of season is Aloe, but there is a tremous poisoning effect about oysters in the hot weather and in the breeding season that is not found at any other time.
A great many people become nauseated, bloat up, purge tremendously, vomit everything for several days after eating oysters.
Now, when that group of symptoms is present Lycopodium will cure it and will remove the tendency to get sick from oysters.
But if you notice those who get sick have a cholera-like trouble from eating oysters in the hot season, you will find that that is where Aloe is the remedy.
Relations: This remedy is not well proved, hence I have first referred to the things it is used for clinically. It is more nearly related to Sulphur in its venous condition than to any other remedy. If you study together, side by side, Kali bi., Sulphur and Aloe, you will be astonished at their wonderful relation to the stomach and bowels.
Mind: Among the few mental symptoms we notice,
"She knew she would die in a week." "Life is a burden." "Disinclined to move."
Very little is brought out by which we can distinguish it; only a few things common to many remedies are given.
The Aloe patient is extremely excitable when under the influence of pain, and the pains are generally in the abdomen. Colic-like pains, flatulent pains in the abdomen, that drive to despair; be becomes extremely irritable and excited in his attacks of colic.
A little symptom that is somewhat striking is, "Hates people, repels everyone."
Head: The head congestion, which occurs during the bowel disturbance, is a sort of venous stasis such as is found in the portal system.
"Headache across forehead."
"Headaches aggravated from heat, ameliorated from cold applications."
Aggravation from heat and relief from cold runs through Aloe.
He wants to be in a cool room; feels hot and flushed; the skin is often hot and dry; he wants to be uncovered at night in bed; burning of the extremities, hot hands and cold feet, or cold bands and hot feet; these alternate. The head feels hot and he wants something cool upon it. This is from the heat of the surface, not fever.
Sensation of heat in the surface, feeling of congestion and fullness of the surface of the body; fullness and engorged veins all over the body. Bleedings are common in this remedy, venous oozings from the nose, the
bowels, the bladder; bleeding in general. The veins become varicose and the skin is hot.
Much heat in the orifices of the body; the eyes, mouth and throat are hot and burn. There is a sensation of dryness, burning and excoriation about the anus.
Stomach and bowels: Under "Eating and Drinking" we find "Soon after supper growling in abdomen."
There are colicky pains in the bowels from eating and drinking when there is no diarrhea, even when there is a state of constipation.
This remedy is useful for the complaints of old beer drinkers. Diarrhea brought on from drinking beer. In persons who have a diarrhea every time they drink beer you will most likely find that Aloe will agree with the symptoms, but sometimes it will be Kali bi., for these two remedies are very similar as to their stomach and bowel symptoms.
"Belching with oppression of stomach."
Here is another instance of the tendency to capillary and venous engorgement. "Vomiting of blood" and blood from the bowels.
There is much pain in the hepatic region, burning and heat, etc. Mostly in the right hypochondrium you will find distension and fullness. It is pre-eminently a liver medicine. It is not as deep in its action as Sulphur.
You will often find that Aloe will serve as a palliative when it will have to be followed by Sulphur, Sulph. ac., Kali bi. or Sepia, the medicines that follow Aloe and are complementary to it, finishing its work.
Aloe will make a good beginning in these liver troubles when there are great fullness, distension, stitching pains in the region of the liver and a dry, hot, burning skin, with no increase of temperature.
Fever and skin: Aloe has some fever, but this sensation of heat of the skin and dryness is without fever and is such as is found in psoric patients. The proving has not been sufficiently extensive to demonstrate whether Aloe produces eruption to any extent or not, but if such could be proved this would place it among the anti-psorics.
It is not a deep long-acting constitutional remedy like Sulphur, and yet it is not so short-acting as Aconite or Belladonna. Complaints come on only with a moderate degree of rapidity. It may be associated very well with Bryonia. Bryonia does not go so deeply into the life substance as Sulphur.
Fullness and distension: Perhaps one of the most striking features of the abdominal state is the fullness, distension and rumbling. It seems as if the abdomen would burst and the rumbling is so great that it can be heard by anyone in the room. It keeps on one continuous gurgling. The stool gurgles out with a noisy rumbling, like water out of a bung-hole.
The text of the earlier writers speaks of it as a sputtering, for while the stool is passing out it is accompanied by much flatus which gurgles and sputters. The abdomen seems to be as much distended as ever even after great quantities of flatus have passed. There is no relief. The pain is especially felt across the abdomen, about the hips.
Great distension as if the abdomen would burst across the transverse colon, and also in the ascending and descending colon; pain, gurgling, rumbling, heaviness, and feeling of pressure outwards.
"Twisting and griping pain in the upper abdomen, around the navel, compelling him to sit bent up which relieves."
"Feeling of weakness in abdomen as if diarrhea would result."
The weakness is sometimes very great, so much so that he is compelled to go to bed with the diarrhea, and you will often mistake it for Podophyllum, so great is the exhaustion. Pod. has great distension, tremendous gushing, much flatulence, great rumbling in the bowel and the trouble comes on at 4 o'clock in the morning.
Aloe is like Sulph. again, in that it drives him out of bed in the early morning with diarrhoea, and there are times when be puts the feet out from beneath the covers to cool them off; the soles of the feet burn and he uncovers them. Griping in the abdomen, feeling of weakness in the abdomen.
"Painfulness in whole abdomen, especially in sides and along both sides of navel."
So sensitive is the abdomen that he can find no comfortable position.
"Dull, abdominal pain as after taking cold, morning and evening repeatedly."
Female: Now here are abdominal symptoms that relate to the condition of the woman and not to diarrhea. "Feeling as if a plug was wedged in between symphysis pubis and os coccygis"
"Labor-like pains in the groins and loins worse when standing."
Aloe has cured prolapsus of the uterus of long standing when it was associated with fullness, heat of the surface of the body, tendency to morning diarrhea, dragging down of the uterus and sensation of a plug wedged in between the symphysis pubis and coccyx.
The outward pressure of the uterus causes that sensation. Dragging down as if all parts of the pelvis would push out.
A funneling sensation in the vagina, in the pelvis. "Urging to stool, only hot flatus passes, giving relief, but urging soon returns."
The idea is that it compels him to go to stool, but when upon the commode nothing but wind passes. It is useful also in old chronic sufferers from this trouble, those who suffer from constipation, who go many days without a stool, but feel every little while, or several times in the day, that they must go to stool, and then only a little wind passes.
Natrum sulph. will commonly overcome that state very. "Lumpy, watery stool."
That is a strong feature of Aloe; hard lumps mingled with a watery stool; the lumps are in the water or in the liquid faeces; little hard lumps looking like marbles or sheep dung.
Rectum and stools: In the constipation the stool is lumpy, like marbles. Sometimes these little nodules remain in the rectum a long time without any urging to stool, and finally escape unconsciously, being found in the clothing. Entire loss of sensation in the anus, an anesthesia; no feeling during the passage of the stool.
Much of the Aloe trouble is dysenteric in character, with a sharp, inflammatory condition of the rectum and lower portion of the colon; bloody discharges and yellow, jelly-like mucus. Sometimes the Aloe patient will pass nothing but large quantities of this catarrhal, jellylike mucus.
Don't forget Aloe for hemorrhoids that form like a bunch of grapes.
"Itching and burning in anus, preventing sleep."
He is compelled to bore with the finger into the anus; so violent is the itching that the patient cannot let it alone; it seems it will drive him to distraction.
He gets relief only from applying something cold. A common feature of Aloe is that ointments increase the burning. There is increased burning of the skin round about the ulcers after applying an ointment. The Sulphur patient also cannot bear any application; it is poisonous to him and he breaks out in eruptions.
Wherever a mucous membrane is inflamed there is formed a deposit of thick, jelly-like mucus. If there is an ulcerated spot or aphthous patch or inflamed surface, thick, jelly-like cakes of mucus may be peeled off almost as thick as leather at times. At times the lower portion of the rectum is in this state and the patient will say that the lumpy stools are caked in jelly.
The lumpy stools in Graphites look as if embedded in coagulated white of egg. Sometimes the Aloe patient, before having a stool, will expel a teacupful of thick, jelly-like mucus which has occupied the lower portion of the rectum.
Aloe cured a case of stricture of the rectum in which it was indicated by this symptom. The stricture prevented nearly all the faecal matter from getting down to the anus, but the rectum would fill up three or four times a day and compel the patient to expel a quantity of jelly-like mucus.
The fames that could be forced through were scarcely larger than a pipe stem. It has been said that our medicines are not capable of curing strictures, but they sometimes do cure strictures. If they can cure the patient it is marvelous how nature will take up all that inflammatory tissue and the canal become normal. This thing has been seen many times in stricture of the urethra and stricture of the rectum.
Alumen
Weakness: This medicine, like Alumina, seems to produce a peculiar kind of Paralytic weakness of the muscles in all parts of the body, a sort of lack of tone.
The extremities are weak. This weakness is felt especially in the rectum and bladder. The stool becomes impacted from want of ability of the rectum and colon to expel their contents.
The bladder is also slowed down in its action, and it is with great difficulty that the urine is voided. After urinating, the bladder often remains half full. The urine is very slow to start, and when the patient stands to urinate the urine falls down perpendicularly, as in Hepar. From this we see the sluggish action. The paralytic condition extends also to the veins producing a vaso-motor paralysis.
Induration: Another peculiar condition running through the remedy is the tendency to induration wherever there is an inflamed surface.
All remedies that have this in their nature relate more or less to cancerous affections, because in cancer we have as the most natural feature a tendency to induration.
Ulcers are common in Alumen, and this induration underlies the ulcer; ulcers with indurated base. Or little scales may appear upon the skin where the circulation is feeble, over cartilaginous portions for instance and a great thick indurated mass forms.
Infiltration takes place under this crust, the crust keeps coming off, and a lack of healing follows because of the weakness of the tissues from a vaso-motor paralysis.
Epithelioma is scarcely more than that, and so we have in this remedy features like epithelioma and other cancerous affections. What is the scirrhus but a peculiar form of induration?
When the economy takes on a low type of life, a low form of tissue making, and the tissues inflame and upon the slightest provocation indurate we can see that this is a kind of constitution that is predisposed to deep-seated troubles, to phthisis, Bright’s disease, diabetes, cancer, etc.
Weare on the border line of ultimates and something Is going to happen. This remedy leads the economy into such a state of disorder, a low type of tissue making is found, and many of these indurations will have cancer as an ultimate. This is a long acting antipsoric remedy.
Glands: There is also in this medicine a tendency to induration of the neck of the uterus and the mammary glands.
Glands become slowly inflamed, and do not stop with ordinary congestion and hardness, but become as hard as bullets.
This induration extends to the various glands of the body, but is especially noticeable in the tonsils.
For those who have a tendency to colds which settle in the throat, especially singling out the tonsils and indurating these; those who keep on taking cold and the tonsils keep on growing, and indurating, we have in Alumen a medicine that fits the whole process, the hardening and infiltration, and it cures these cases according to the law of similars, when the symptoms agree.
It cures young children growing up with enormously enlarged and very hard tonsils in whom every cold settles in the throat.
Alumen is one of Baryta carb., which has the same tendency. In one patient there will be one kind of constitution, and, after thoroughly examining it, looks like Baryta carb.
You may have a different constitution in another patient, and, after carefully examining it, see that it looks like Alumen; another you will see is Sulphur; another, if you look into it carefully, you find is Calcarea carb., and another, Calcarea iod., and so on among those remedies capable of bringing about the conditions described.
If we can find symptoms which picture the constitutional state we have no trouble. When the symptoms have been well gathered the case is as good as cured; it is easy then to find a remedy.
Partially proved: This remedy is imperfect from the fact that it is only partially proved. I do not care to dwell upon partially proved remedies, but when they have a number of striking features that fit into everyday life it is important to know them. The mental symptoms of this remedy are very few.
The remedy should be proved in the higher potencies upon sensitive persons in order that the mental state may be brought out.
Head: Some of the symptoms of the head are very striking and valuable. Pain on the top of the head with burning. The pain is a sensation as if a weight were pressing down into the skull. You will see a woman in bed with her hand on top of the head and she will say:
"Doctor, it burns right there like fire, and it presses as if my skull would be crushed in, and the only relief I get from pressing hard upon it an from an ice cold cloth pressed upon it."
She wants the cloth changed and made cold every few minutes. It is a queer thing that a pressing pain is made better from pressing upon the part. This is like Cactus, pressing pain on vertex relieved from pressure.
The rubric of remedies with that symptom is very small, and hence this remedy fills a place.
There are some strange, rare and peculiar symptoms for which paucity of remedies, and we have to work in other channels and along sidetracks in getting the constitutional state of the patient.
Alumen cured the pressing pain on the vertex in one patient in whom it alternated with the most troublesome chronic, irritable bladder.
"Vertigo: lying on his back, with weakness in pit of stomach; > opening eyes; > turning on right side."
Heart: There is another feature, however, in this remedy, the palpitation is brought on from lying on the right side.
It would strike anyone as something very singular, because palpitation is generally worse lying on the left side.
A heart that is fluttering, enlarged or disordered is generally worse while lying on the left, as the heart has less room then, but it is strange, rare and unique when these symptoms are worse lying on the right side.
When this condition is present in a patient it is necessary to find a remedy having just exactly that symptom, and very often it will be seen that the rest of the symptoms of the case fit into the remedy that has produced this peculiar state.
There is one more feature that you must add to these things, viz.: slowness and sluggishness of the muscles throughout the body, a slowing down of all the muscles, a sense of weakness in the arms and legs.
Stools and rectum: In the constipation there may be some urging to stool without result or he may go several days without desire. There is no ability to expel the stool. He will strain a long time with no success, and finally after many days the stool is passed and is an agglomeration of hard balls, large masses of little bard balls like marbles all fastened together.
This is a very strong feature in an Alumen constitution.
"Stool: less frequent, dryer and harder; large black, hard or in small pieces like sheep's dung; no relief afterwards."
After stool there is a sensation as if the rectum were yet full. This peculiar feature comes with the weakness or paresis of the rectum, i. e., the rectum is not strong enough to expel all of its contents, and hence the
sensation of unfinished stool.
In the rectum there is ulceration with bleeding from the ulcers. The hemorrhoids ulcerate and they are very painful, so that after every stool he has prolonged suffering, a dull aching pain in the rectum.
Catarrhal conditions prevail throughout the remedy.
In old scrofulous, psoric patients, who are subject to chronic yellow bland discharges from the eyes, with enlarged veins; chronic yellow discharges from the vagina and from the urethra in the male; chronic painless gonorrhoea.
In addition to the catarrhal discharges there is a tendency to ulceration, so that there are little ulcerative patches in the vagina, little aphthous patches in the vagina and on the cervix of the uterus.
When a patient is suffering from a chronic gonorrhoea, instead of the discharge becoming white as ina gleet if remains yellow, and there are little indurations along the urethra, which the patient will call the physician’s attention to as "Jumps".
Discharge with "little bunches" along the urethra. These are little ulcers, and beneath the ulcers are indurations.
When this state is present you have an Alumen gonorrhoea. In a little while the patient will have two or three strictures unless he gets this remedy, because these little ulcers will each end in stricture narrowing
the canal. Another strange feature in the catarrhal states and in the ulcers is its tendency to affect the vessels.
The veins become varicose and bleed, so that there may be bleeding from any of the inflamed or catarrhal areas and bleeding from the ulcers.
There are many neuralgic pains about the head of a non descript character. These head pains come on in the morning on awaking.
Eyes: The eye symptoms are of an inflammatory or congestive character, with tendency to ulceration. Purulent ophthalmia; chronic sore eyes.
"Sees things double by candle light."
"Nasal polypus left side. Lupus or cancer on the nose. Face pale as a corpse, lips blue. Scirrhus of the tongue."
Mouth: See what a tendency it has to produce minute growths, little indurations and infiltrations. Bleeding from the teeth; the teeth decay and the gums recede from the teeth; the teeth become loose; scorbutic appearance of the gums.
"Mouth burning, ulcerated; grey, dirty, spongy skin about a tooth, which is surrounded with proud flesh; offensive saliva."
In the mouth we have the same general feature of ulceration, with dryness of the mouth, dry tongue and throat, and great thirst for ice cold water.
"Uvula inflamed and enlarged. Predisposed to tonsillitis." "Vomits everything he eats."
After that you can put the word "ulcer," because it especially refers to that state of congestion, where there is easy ulceration.
Abdomen: Under abdomen we find flatulence.
The intestines do not perform their work, they take on spasmodic action, and consequently the patient suffers from cramps and colicky pains; boring, rending, tearing pains.
Retraction of the abdomen and drawing in of the navel. If you will compare Lead in its poisonous effects upon those who work in white lead you will see quite a counterpart of this remedy, and you will not be surprised to observe that Plumbum and this remedy antidote each other.
They do so because they are so similar, they cannot live in the same house. Alumen is a great remedy to overcome lead colic in those who work in lead; it removes the susceptibility.
There are many painters who have to give up their occupation on account of this susceptibility. Alumen will often overcome this tendency and enable them to go back to their business. Etc, Female: In the female we note
W ‘4 . . . . . weight of uterus presses down collum; granulations of vagina; leucorrhoea copious; emaciation; yellow complexion; indurations of uterus, even scirrhus; ulcers of uterus."
Sometimes you get evidence of this vaginal state by the woman saying that coition is so painful that it becomes impossible; it is not to be wondered at that the natural act cannot be performed when so much trouble is present.
Larynx and Chest "Voice entirely lost."
Chronic loss of the voice from a low state of the economy and from always taking fresh colds. Expectoration of much yellow mucus; scraping of the throat all the time to get rid of a little accumulation of yellow mucus.
"Dry cough in evening after lying down." "Chronic morning cough."
Cough is not a very important thing in this remedy; it is the general state of the economy that is to be looked at. The cough will not interpret the nature of the disease to the physician, because when these little ulcers are present they must cause some kind of a cough. This patient may go into phthisis or be affected with any of the ultimates of disease.
Alumen has been very useful in the treatment of old people who morning expectoration, catarrh of the chest, suffer from copious, ropy, haemoptysis and great weakness of the chest, so that it is difficult to expel the mucus. In this it is similar to Antimonium tartaricum.
Alumen and Alumina: Because of its relation to Alumina further provings; will undoubtedly develop the fact that it has many spinal symptoms. It is well known that it has a weak spine, with coldness of the spine, a feeling as if cold water were poured own the back.
Pain in the dorsal spine on a line with the inferior angle of the scapulae; weakness in this region and in the shoulders.
Like Alumina it has the sensation of constriction, as of a cord or band around the limbs. Feeling as if a cord were drawn tightly around the upper arm.
The clumsiness of the fingers, as seen in dropping things, the pain in the lower limbs at night, the lassitude and numbness, are other manifestations of spinal symptoms.
Sensation as of a cord around the leg under the knee; soles sensitive to pressure on walking; feet numb and cold, although warmly covered; legs cold to knees.
These are all further evidences of the action of the remedy on the spinal cord. Bruised pain in all the limbs. Crawling, tingling paralysis of all the limbs.
He is kept awake at night by a sensation as if the blood rushed through the body. Many complaints come on during sleep. Night mare. He is sensitive to weather changes and very sensitive to cold.
Alumina
Alumen and Alumina: This remedy comes in very nicely after Alumen, which has much Alumina in its nature and depends largely upon Alumina, which is its base, for its way of working.
It occurs to me to throw out a little hint. When you have a good substantial proving of an oxide ora carbonate, and the mental symptoms are well brought out, you can use these, in a measure in a presumptive way, in prescribing another salt, with the same base, which has a few mental symptoms in its proving.
For instance, you have a group of symptoms decidedly relating to Alumen.
The mental symptoms of Alumen, however, have not been brought out to any extent, but still you have the mental symptoms of the base of Alumen, which is the oxide, so that if the patient has the mental symptoms of Alumina and the physical symptoms of Alumen, you can rationally presume that Alumen will cure because of the Aluminum in each.
Mind: We know the mental symptoms of Alumina fairly well.
It especially takes hold of the intellect and so confuses the intelligence that the patient is unable to effect a decision; the judgment is disturbed.
He is unable to realize; the things that he knows or has known to be real seem to him to be unreal, and he is in doubt as to whether they are so or not.
In the Guiding Symptoms this is not so plainly expressed, but in the Chronic Diseases we have a record of this which is the best expression of it that occurs anywhere.
There we read:
"When he says anything he feels as if another person had said it, and when he sees anything, as if another person had seen it, or as if he could transfer himself into another and only then could see."
That is to say, there is a confusion of mind, a confusion of ideas and thoughts. It has cured these symptoms.
The consciousness of his personal identity is confused. He is not exactly certain who he was; it seemed as though he were not himself.
He is in a dazed condition of mind. He makes mistakes in writing and speaking! uses words not intended; uses wrong words.
Confusion and obscuration of e intellect. Inability to follow up a train of thought. Then he enters into another state, in which he gets into a hurry. Nothing moves fast enough; time seems so slow; everything is delayed; nothing goes right.
Besides this he has impulses. When he sees sharp instruments or blood, impulses rise up within him and he shudders because of these impulses. An instrument that could be used for murder or for killing causes these impulses to arise; impulse to kill herself.
The Alumina patient is very sad, constantly sad. Incessantly moaning; groaning, worrying, fretting and ina hurry.
Wants to get away; wants to get away from this place, hoping that things will be better; full of fears.
All sorts of imaginations. A sort of general apprehensiveness. When he meditates upon this state of mind he thinks he is going to lose his reason.
He thinks about this frenzy and hurry and confusion of mind, how he hardly knows his own name, and how fretful he is, and he wonders if he is not going crazy, and finally he really thinks he is going crazy.
Most of the mental symptoms come on in the morning on waking. Sadness and weeping on waking in the morning. His moods alternate.
Sometimes his mental state is a little improved and his mood changes into a quiet placid state, and again he goes into fear and apprehensiveness. Some evil is going to take place and he is full of anxiety. Anxiety about the future.
Nerves and weakness: The next most striking feature is the way in which the remedy acts upon the nerves that proceed from the spine.
There is a state of weakness of the muscles supplied by these nerves; weakness over the whole body. There is difficulty in swallowing, a paralytic condition of the oesophagus; difficulty in raising or moving the arms; paralysis of one side of the body, or paralysis of the muscles of the lower extremities, or of the bladder and rectum.
The paralytic state begins as a sort of a semi - paralysis, for a long time merely an inactivity, which grows at length into a complete paralytic condition. Everything is slowed down.
The conductivity of the nerves is impaired so that a prick of a pin upon the extremities is not felt until a second or so afterwards. All of his senses are impaired in this way until it really means a benumbing of the
consciousness and appears to be a kind of stupefaction of his intellect, a mental sluggishness. Impressions reach his mind with a marked degree of slowness.
The paralytic state runs through the remedy and is observed in various parts in many ways. The bladder manifests it in the slowness with which the urine passes.
A woman sits a long time before the flow starts, with inability to press, and then the stream flows slowly. The patient will say she cannot burry the flow of urine. The urine is slow to start and slow to flow, and sometimes only dribbles. At times it is retained and dribbles involuntarily.
This slowness is observed also in the rectum. Its tone is lost and there is inability to perform the ordinary straining when sitting at stool, and so paretic is the rectum that it may be full and distended, and the quantity of faeces enormous, and yet, though the stool is soft, there is constipation.
In this remedy there is often a hard stool, but we notice that the remedy will do the best work where there is this paretic condition of the rectum with soft stool. If the mental symptoms however, are present, such as I have described, with large, hard and knotty or lumpy stool, Alumina will cure.
Now, so great is the straining to pass a soft stool that you will sometimes hear a patient describe the state as follows:
When sitting upon the seat she must wait a long time, though there is fullness and she has gone many days without stool; she has the consciousness that, she should pass a stool and is conscious of the fullness in the rectum, yet she will sit a long time and finally will undertake to help herself by pressing down violently with the abdominal muscles, straining vigorously, yet conscious that very little effort is made by the rectum itself.
She will continue to strain, covered with copious sweat, hanging on to the seat, if there be any place to hang on to, and will pull and work as if in labor, and at last is able to expel a soft stool, yet with the sensation that more stool remains.
Of course a number of other remedies have this straining to pass a soft stool, but they have their own characteristics. Take for example an individual who cannot keep awake; she says that it is impossible for her to read a line without going to sleep; that she can sleep all the time; she suffers night and day from a dry mouth, and the tongue cleave to the roof of the mouth.
Now let her describe this state of straining and struggling to expel a soft stool, and you hardly need to go any further before you know the remedy.
If that patient in addition to what she has said tells you that she is in the habit of fainting when standing any length of time, that she is disturbed in a close room and has all sorts of complaints in the cold air, it is Nux moschata.
Now you see how easy it is for remedies to talk; they tell their own story. Suppose a woman should come to you who has been suffering from haemorrhage, from prolonged oozing, who is pallid and weak and is distended with flatulence, with much belching and passing of gas, and the more she passes the worse she feels, and she has these same symptoms of straining a long time to pass a soft stool, tremendous effort with inactivity of the rectum. You could do nothing but give her China.
Now you know how easy it is for remedies to talk and tell their own story.
By allowing remedies to talk and tell their own story, individualization is accomplished.
I have said all that to show that it is not upon the inactivity of the rectum that you are to decide upon the remedy.
Individualization must be made through the patient. That is a principle that should never be violated. You may have twenty remedies all possessing a certain symptom but if you have a few real decided things that you can say about the patient, the manner in which he does business, the manner in which the disease affects the entire man, then you have something to individualize by.
You have seen the Alumina patient, the China patient and the Nux moschata patient. The sole duty of the physician is to treat the sick, which means to study the patient himself until an idea of the sickness is obtained.
Vertigo: This medicine is full of vertigo; he quivers, reels and "objects go round" almost constantly. It corresponds to the vertigo of tired-out people, old broken down patients, men worn out from old age.
Vertigo also that comes on when closing the eyes, as is found in spinal affections, in sclerosis of posterior lateral columns.
Alumina has produced affections analogous to locomotor ataxia. It produces numbness of the soles of the feet, the fulgurating pains, the vertigo when closing the eyes, and produces staggering and disturbances of coordination.
It is true that in an early stage of locomotor ataxia Alumina will check the disease process by bringing into order the internal state of the economy.
With Aluminum metallicum I have, stopped fulgurating pains in old incurable cases, and improved the reflexes wonderfully, thus showing the general improvement of the patient.
Modalities: Most of the symptoms are < on rising in the morning. In the morning as I have mentioned it, the urine is slower to pass than after, he has moved about and warmed up a little. His limbs are stiffer in the morning and in the morning he has to whip up his mental
state. He wakes up confused and wonders where he is.
You will see that in children especially-they wake up in the morning in a bewildered state, such as you will find in Alumina, Aesculus, Lycopod.
He has to put his mind on things to ascertain whether they be so or not, as to how things should look and wonders whether he is at home or in some other place.
There are many headaches with nausea and vomiting. The headaches come whenever he takes cold. This probably is due to the catarrhal state.
Mucous membranes: The Alumina patient suffers almost constantly from dryness of mucous membranes, the nose is dry, stuffed up, especially in one side, commonly the left.
Nose feels full of sticks, dry membranes or crusts, old atrophic catarrh crusts in the posterior nares and in the fossa of Rosenmuller.
Large green, offensive crusts all through the nose. Now comes the relation to the headache. Every time he catches cold the thick yellow discharge slacks up and gives way to a watery discharge and be has pain in the forehead over the eyes, going through the head, with nausea and vomiting.
So when it says headache from chronic catarrh that is what it means. The headache > lying down. He has sick headaches and periodical headaches.
You will see that Alumina corresponds to a constitution that may be called psoric-old, broken-down, feeble constitutions, scrofulous constitutions, such as are inclined to tubercles and catarrhal affections.
The catarrhal tendency of this remedy is marked. Catarrhs are found wherever mucous membranes exist. Alumina affects the skin and mucous membrane extensively, i. e., the external and internal skin, the surfaces of the body.
The patient is always expectorating, he blows the nose much and has discharges from the eyes. There is much disturbance of vision belonging to this catarrhal state that may be spoken of now.
Dimness of vision, as if looking through a fog sometimes described as through a veil. A misty dimness of vision.
There is also disturbance of the muscles of the eye, of the muscles of the ball and of the ciliary muscle. Weak and changeable vision. The paralytic weakness, such as belongs to the whole remedy, will be found in certain muscles, or sets of muscles, so that it is with great difficulty that glasses can be adjusted. The activity of the eye muscles is disturbed.
Naso pharynx: The catarrhal state extends over into the back of the nose and the posterior nares are filled up with tough mucus and crusts, and on looking into the throat you will see that the soft palate and the mucous membrane of the tonsils and pharynx and all parts that can be seen are in a state of granulation, are swollen, congested and inflamed.
The pharynx feels dry and there is a chronic sensitiveness and soreness. When swallowing food there is stinging and sensation as if the throat were full of little sticks, especially after a moment's rest, better by moistening and swallowing. In the night air, after keeping still a while, there in an accumulation of ropy mucus.
This extends into the larynx with soreness in the larynx and chest and chronic dry, backing cough. The same catarrhal state proceeds down into the oesophagus, so that it becomes sensitive and clumsy. He swallows with difficulty.
The bolus goes down with an effort and he feels it all the way down. There is soreness and clumsiness, paresis and difficulty of swallowing.
This paralytic weakness reminds the patient that he must put on a little force in order to swallow and this swallowing is felt while the substance goes down as if the oesophagus was sensitive. It has a catarrhal state of the stomach, bowels and rectum so that with the soft and difficult stool there is often an accumulation of mucus.
There is also a catarrhal condition in the bladder, kidneys and urethra and an old gonorrhoea will be prolonged into a catarrhal or gleety discharge.
Sometimes it is not a gleet, but the discharge remains for many months and instead of its being a light milky white, such as is natural in most prolonged cases of gonorrhoea, it remains yellow and is painless. So it is with the vagina.
The mucous discharge from the vagina is thick yellowish-white discharge, sometimes excoriating. Thus we see, in the constitution we have described, that an extensive catarrhal state belongs to the remedy.
Skin: When we come to the skin we find that it takes on a similar state of affairs. The patient is subject to all sorts of eruptions. The skin withers, becomes dry and is subject to eruptions, thickening, indurations, ulcerations, cracking and bleeding.
The eruptions itch worse in the warmth of the bed. The skin itches, even when there is no eruption, when becoming warm in bed, so that he scratches until the skin bleeds. This presents an idea as to eruptions that you will have to consider. A patient comes to you covered with crusts, and he says:
"When I get warm at night I have to scratch, and I scratch until the skin bleeds."
Now in Alumina it is very important to find out whether these crusts were produced by the scratching or whether the eruption, came out as an itching eruption, for in Alumina in the beginning there is no eruption, but he scratches until the skin is off and then come the crusts.
You must here prescribe not for the eruption, but for the itching of the skin without eruption. Now in Mezereum, Arsenicum, Dolichos and Alumina the skin itches and he scratches until it bleeds, and then he gets relief.
Of course after this there is an apparent eruption because crusts form. As soon as the healing begins the itching begins, and he is only relieved when the skin is raw. With the bleeding moisture of the skin there is relief of the itching.
Now some of the books do not make the distinction between itching without eruption and itching with eruption, and hence mostly all young, doctors get to thinking that itching of the skin must always be associated with eruption, and make a mistake in figuring out what kind of an eruption it is.
The skin thickens and indurates and ulcerates, and there are indurations under the ulcers. There is a very sluggish condition of both mucous membrane and skin with a tendency to induration.
Thickening of the mucous membrane will be found anywhere; after the thickening come little ulcerations, and in the course of time indurations are formed at the base of the ulcers. The same thing is true of the skin. Dryness and burning through everything and may be said of all the mucous membranes and the skin in general.
Chronic granular lids. It we turn the eyelids down we will see that the mucous membrane is thickened. Sometimes this thickening or hypertrophy causes a turning out of the lids like ectropion.
"The eyelashes fall out;” that is in keeping with the general state.
The hairs all over the body fall out. Parts become entirely denuded of hair; the hair of the scalp falls out extensively. All sorts of sounds in the ears, buzzing, etc., and derangement of hearing; purulent otorrhoea.
"Point of nose cracked" is in keeping with the remedy.
Induration here and there so that it favors lupus and epithelioma in one who is subject to these swellings and eruptions.
Alumina and Alumen, like Ars., Lach., Sulph. and, Conium, are medicines that relate to these troubles. Some of these have made brilliant cures where there is infiltration.
Upon the skin of the face and other parts of the body there is crawling Itching especially when getting warm. Sensation of tension. Peculiar sensation about the face and other parts not covered by clothing, a
sensation of dried white of egg on the face, of dried blood or cobweb on the face.
If you have ever been going through a place where there are cobwebs and a little cobweb has strung across your face you will know what a peculiar sensation of crawling it produces, and you cannot leave it alone until it is removed.
That sensation particularly belongs to Alumina, Borax, Bar. c.
Little, crawlings and creepings in the skin. Itching of the face. These symptoms are so irritating that the patient will sit and rub his face all the time.
You will think that he is nervous. He has the appearance of being nervous as he sits rubbing the back of his hands. It is well to find out whether he does this because he cannot keep his hands still or because of the itching. Because of this itching sensation in the face he carries the hand to the face as though to brush away something.
Throat: Perhaps I have not said as much as should be said about the throat. "Ulcers in the fauces, spongy, secreting a yellowish brown, badly smelling pus."
It may be said that the patient is often a victim of chronic sore throat. There is this about Alumina, it has a special tendency to localize itself upon mucous membranes.
You will find in an Alumina subject bleeding from all mucous membranes. He has catarrh of the nose and red eyes, and his nose becomes stuffed up and he has many acute colds; very severe throat trouble.
Discharges from all of the orifices. It is not a medicine that would be selected for a cold settling in the throat, not a remedy for acute sore throat, but it is a deep acting anti psoric, and act for months.
Its greatest usefulness is as a remedy for taking cold.
In this respect it is like Sil., Graph. and Sulfur. It effects tissue changes, and it does this slowly, for it is a slow-acting medicine.
While the patient himself with these deep seated psoric affections feels better generally after the remedy, it will be months before his symptoms go away.
He may say: "I feel better, but my symptoms all appear to be here. I can eat better and sleep better."
Then it would be unwise to change the remedy. You need not expect to get immediate relief of the catarrhs and pains in the back and other symptoms for which you gave this remedy.
You may be satisfied if you get the results after many weeks. You will find the same thing in the paralytic weakness produced by Plumbum.
There is a new drug that is coming into use, the proving of which is very full and rich, and it is analogous to the symptoms of this remedy. It is Curare.
Curare: I wish we had a finer proving of it, but it is rich with a great many things similar to Alumina and Plumbum, and especially in the weakness of the hands and fingers of pianists.
An old player will say that after she has been playing-for some time her fingers slow down. The weakness seems to be in the extensors. Lack of ability to life the fingers; the lifting motion is lost.
Curare to a great extent overcomes that, causes quickness to that lifting power of the fingers. But this remedy also runs through in general way such paretic conditions; while Curare is especially related to a paralytic condition of the extensors more than the flexors, the paralysis in Alumina is of both flexors and extensors.
Alumina: This medicine is one of the few that have been found to be aggravated from starch, especially the starch of potatoes.
Aggravation from eating potatoes. It has indigestion, diarrhea, great flatulence, aggravation of the cough from eating potatoes.
It has also aggravation from salt, wine, vinegar, pepper and from spirituous drinks.
Alumina is a spinal remedy and aggravation from spirituous drinks is in keeping with some other spinal remedies.
You find it in Zincum. The Zincum patient cannot drink wine, for all of his complaints are aggravated by it.
This medicine is so sensitive and so easily overcome by a small amount of liquor that he is obliged to abandon it. He is not only intoxicated by it, but it aggravates his complaints.
Stomach and digestion: Now the digestion has practically given out in this medicine. He is subject to catarrh of the stomach, to ulceration of the stomach, to indigestion from the simplest food. Sour and bitter eructations.
Vomiting of food, mucus or bile. Nausea, vertigo, heartburn, much flatulence. Vomits mucus and water. Stomach is distended with gas. The liver is full. of suffering. Both hypochondria are full of misery, but especially the right.
When going over Alumen I called attention especially to its antidotal relation to Lead.
This remedy also will overcome the poisonous effects of lead and sensitiveness to lead. Colic and paralytic weakness in lead workers, painters and artists and in those who are so sensitive to lead that from using hair wash containing lead they are paralyzed.
Not many years ago the acetate of lead was commonly used by women for leucorrhoea, but it was found that so many were sensitive to it that it was abandoned, Alumina is the most prominent antidote to the affections which have come about through that sensitive state.
Fissures: There is so much under stool and rectum that belongs to the general state that there is scarcely anything left to be presented except some important particulars. As you might suppose, this remedy has fissures; you would naturally expect these when you consider what kind. of mucous membranes and tissues this patient manufactures. He suffers greatly from constipation, he does much straining, the mucous membrane is thickened and swollen, and hence we have a fissure.
When you see a remedy manufacturing and producing such a state upon the economy, growing that kind of mucous membrane that would favour fissures, you do not have to wait until you have cured a fissure with that remedy to find out if it will suit the case.
You do not have to resort to the repertory to see what this remedy has done in fissure. From your general knowledge of the medicine, you will see that it ought to cure the patient, as it produces such a condition of
the mucus membrane and skin as would be naturally found in one who has a fissure.
The skin indurates and ulcerates and becomes clumsy and unhealthy and constipation is produced, and so, after studying the remedy in that way, you are not surprised if it cures a fissure.
You can also think over what other medicines have this state of the economy and see what other remedies you would expect to cure a fissure with.
If you look into the nature of Nitric acid, Causticum and Graphites, you will see why they have had a wonderful record for curing fissure. That is the way to study your Materia Medica; see what it does to the man himself, to his organs and tissues.
Bladder: "Frequent micturition." "Urine voided while straining at stool, or cannot pass urine without such straining"
That is a high grade symptom, it is a peculiar symptom, and may be called a particular of first grade. He must strain at stool in order to empty the contents of the bladder.
"Urine smarting, corroding." "Feeling of weakness in the bladder and genitals." "Swelling and discharge of light yellow pus from urethra."
"Burning with discharge of urine.”
Male: The symptoms of the male sexual organs are characterized by weakness, impotency and nightly emissions; suitable when the sexual organs are worn out from abuse or over use.
There is fullness and enlargement of the prostate gland and various disturbances of the prostrate, with sensation of fullness in the perineum.
Unpleasant sensations and distress in the region of the prostate gland after coition. Complaints at the time of, or after ejaculation, or after an emission.
The sexual desire is diminished and sometimes entirely lost. Paralytic weakness or paresis of the sexual organs; a state that is in keeping with the whole remedy.
"Discharge of prostatic fluid during difficult stool."
"Painful erections at night."
Female: The female has a great deal of trouble that can be cured with this remedy, but her troubles are mostly catarrhal.
An instance of this is the leucorrhoea; copious, acrid or excoriating, yellow leucorrhoea; leucorrhoea so copious that it runs down the thighs, making the parts red and inflamed.
Ulceration about the os. The mucous membranes are weak and patulous and ulcerate easily. All the parts are ina state of weakness.
There is dragging down from the relaxed condition of the ligaments. Sensation of weight; the pelvic viscera feel heavy. The discharge, stringy, looking like white of egg, copious and acrid; transparent mucus.
" Leucorrhoea, corroding, profuse; running down to heels."
It is more noticeable in the day time, because these complaints are generally worse when walking or when standing, which is not really an important symptom, but a common condition.
After menstruation it takes the woman nearly until the next period to get straightened up. All her muscles are weak; there seems to be no tonicity about her. It is highly suitable to women drawing near the end of menstruation, about forty years of age; the menstrual period prostrates, the flow is scanty, yet prostrating; the sufferings are terrible and the patient is miserable at the menstrual period. After menses, exhausted in body and mind, is a strong feature of Alumina.
It is a suitable remedy again when the woman has a gonorrhoea which has been prolonged by palliation. She has been made comfortable by partly suitable remedies, but it seems that no remedy has been quite deep enough to root out the trouble, for it keeps coming back.
In a discharge that keeps returning, better for little while on Pulsatilla, and on this and that and the other thing, and even on Thuja, given more especially because it is gonorrhoea than because she is a sick woman.
The patient is tired and worn out, and when you come to look at the whole patient and you see the paretic condition, the continued return of the discharge that has been palliated by remedies, think of this medicine in both the male and female.
The discharge is a painless one in the male. The gonorrhoeal discharge has lasted a long time, going and coming, until now there is left but a few drops and it is painless.
The remedy has cured many of these old cases. Threatening chronic catarrh. The mucous membrane everywhere is in a congested state and is weak.
A pregnant woman has some trouble as well. A woman, who is not naturally a sufferer from constipation, when pregnant becomes constipated, with all the characterizing features of Alumina, i. e., the inactivity of the rectum, no expulsive force; she must use the abdominal muscles, must strain a long time.
Infant: Again, the infant has a similar kind of straining. You will see the new-born infant, or the infant on few months old, that will need Alumina.
It is a very common medicine for constipation in infants when you can find nothing else; the child will strain and strain and make every effort to press the stool out, and upon examining the stool it is found to be soft, and should have been expelled easily.
It has hoarseness and loss of voice and paralytic weakness of the larynx. That is not strange; it is only in keeping with the general state, the broken down constitution. He has a weak voice and, if a singer, he is
capable of singing only a little while, only capable of slight exertion.
Everything is a burden. A paralytic condition of the vocal cords, which steadily increases to loss of voice.
Cough and Chest: The most striking things we come to now are the cough and chest troubles. There is expectoration in some of the coughs, but the cough is usually a constant, dry, hacking cough one of those troublesome lingering coughs that has existed for years.
It competes with Arg. met. in its character of the dry, hacking cough, especially associated with weakness, but Arg. met. has the cough in the day time, which is not so in Alumina.
The Alumina cough is in the morning. Here is a symptom that about covers the Alumina cough: "Cough soon after waking in the morning."
Every morning, a long attack of dry cough. The cough is hard, a continued dry hacking, and she coughs until she loses her breath and vomits, and loses the urine.
This symptom commonly occurs in the woman. "Dry, hacking cough with frequent sneezing.” It says in the text "from elongated uvula," but it should read "from sensation of elongated uvula."
It is a sensation as if there were something tickling the throat; a tickling as if the uvula were hanging down a long distance, and he will tell you that his palate must be too long.
Another expression which is the same thing is "cough from sensation as of loose skin hanging in throat."
Some times those who do not know about the palate will talk of something loose in the throat, while those who know they have an uvula will generally call it the palate. But it is the same idea. Tickling in the larynx, too.
Singers: This is always quoted in singers. We would think of Alumina when singers break down in the voice from paralysis or from overwork of the voice.
The voice lets down and becomes feeble, and, when taking cold, there starts up a peculiar kind of tickling.
Alumina is very useful in these cases. Arg. met. was the remedy used by the earlier homoeopaths for singers and talkers with much trembling and letting down of the voice before the value of Alumina was known in such conditions.
Let me tell you something here about Rhus, as I may not think of it again. Many old singers, after taking cold, have a weakness left in the voice, which they notice on beginning to sing.
On beginning to sing the voice is weak and husky, but after using it a little while it improves. Give Rhus to all these patients, prima donnas, lawyers, preachers, etc.
They must warm up the voice and then they are all right, but they say:
"If I go back into the green room and wait a little while, when I commence to sing again I am worse than ever."
The voice is better if they stay in a very hot room and keep it in use. This fits into the general state of Rhus.
Hoarseness: There is a kind of hoarseness that you may discover to be a little different from the paralytic hoarseness of Alumina and Arg. met.
This hoarseness of which I speak belongs to this same class of people; on first beginning to use the voice it seems that they must get rid of some mucus by clearing the throat until the voice can get to work.
The vocal cords on beginning to work are covered with mucus and on getting rid of it they can do very good work, so long as they keep at it.
That is Phosphorus. In such cases the use of the voice becomes painful. The vocal cords are painful after motion and the larynx is painful to touch.
Some times this is so marked that it is like stabbing with a knife on trying to use the voice. So we must individualize hoarseness very extensively.
Homoeopathy is a matter of discrimination. Soreness of the chest which is much increased by talking. There is weakness of the muscular power of the chest. The lungs seem weak and the chest has a sensation of weakness in it. Jar increases the misery of the chest.
Back and limbs: The next most striking features will be in connection with the back and limbs, and I have spoken of these in general way.
Burning in the spine; much pain in the back. Burning and stitching pains in the back. He expresses it as follows:
"Pain in the back, as if a hot iron was thrust through lower vertebrae."
In myelitis this medicine does wonderful work when there is a considerable amount of spasmodic condition of the back as well, showing that the membranes are involved.
Another thing that belongs to this remedy that is a well known state in myelitis is the hoop sensation; sensation of bandages here and there about the limbs and body is a common symptom.
A sensation of a tight cord around the body characteristic of the most marked state of irritation and myelitis. Irritation of the spinal cord with sensitive places.
Burning places as ifa hot iron were forced into the spine. Pain along the cord, rending, tearing pains in the cord with paralytic weakness, increasing paralysis and complete paralysis; paralysis of one side of the body.
"Pain in sole of foot on stepping, as though it were too soft and swollen."
"Numbness of heel when stepping.” "Trembling of knees," this is a mere matter of the general weakness. "Limbs go to sleep when sitting."
Whenever the limb is pressed again anything it will go to sleep. Feeble circulation, feeble conductivity, feeble nerve action; everything is slowed down.
Arms and legs feel heavy.
"Pains in limbs as if bones were squeezed narrower, with pressure in the joints."
Now I will read some of the nerve symptoms which will corroborate some of the things we have gone over. "Want of bodily irritability."
"Great exhaustion of strength, especially after walking in open air."
"One-sided paralysis, especially of the extensors."
"Rheumatic and traumatic paralysis in gouty patients."
Gouty patients with nodules in the joints; old broken down constitutions with paretic exhaustion. "Excited condition of mind and body."
Tremblings here and there in the body.
"Slow, tottering gait as after severe illness."
He must make slow motions, he cannot hurry.
"Involuntary motions."
Sleep and dreams: There are all sorts of dreams and disturbances in sleep, so that the sleep may be quite disturbed and restless.
Unrefreshing sleep, waking up with palpitation of the heart. "Many dreams and frequent awaking; starts in affright; muttering or crying." "During sleep cervical muscles drew head backward;"
this is in cases of paralytic weakness; has to wake up as the muscles of the back of the neck pull so. Jerks in the back of the neck during sleep.
Running through the remedy very often, there is a great lack of animal heat, coldness, and yet the patient wants to be in the open air; must be well clothed open and kept warm, but wants to be in the open air.
The patient takes cold continually from every change and draft. Sometimes the patient will go to bed as cold as a frog, and when warm in bed is so disturbed by itching and the warmth of the bed that there is no comfort.
These are two extremes coming together. The circulation is so feeble over the extremities and backs of the hands that in cold weather the hands are constantly cold and covered with cracks and fissures that bleed.
Skin: The skin along the shin bone is rough, ragged and itching. It has been said that dry weather and dry, cold weather increase the complaints of Alumina, and that wet weather sometimes ameliorates.
The febrile condition of this remedy is not at all marked. There is not much chill and not much fever, but the passive, slow, sluggish, chronic elements and chronic symptoms are the ones that prevail most markedly. In weak, broken-down cases there are some night sweats and sweating towards morning. Slight chill in morning. Chill with thirst.
A striking feature of the remedy is the chronic dryness of the skin. Sweat is rare and scant.
This is not especially suitable for this copious, exhaustive sweats. It is the very opposite of Calcarea, which sweats copiously, but this remedy, with spinal and paralytic affections, is tired out from exertion, very exhausted, but does not sweat.
Pile on the covers to make him sweat if you will, but he only gets hot and itching and does not sweat.
Scanty sweat. Entire inability to sweat. Chronic dryness of skin with fissures. The skin becomes worn and ragged and fissured from its dryness. Great dryness of the thick skin over the back of the hands, and in cold weather the hands become cold and discolored.
Ambra Grisea
Premature old age: On looking over this remedy as a whole it will appear to you that you have been studying the characteristics of one prematurely old.
You will often see symptoms coming on in one at fifty years of age that should appear at eighty, and after studying this remedy you will see that the same aspect is presented, a premature old age.
We recognize trembling and a peculiar kind of feebleness that cannot be described by any expression but senility; it is not the confusion of mind belonging to sickness, but the peculiar state we recognize in old people, in declining life; trembling and tottering and a dreamy state of mind with forgetfulness.
He goes on from one subject to another, asking a question, and, without waiting for it to be answered, asking another.
And so he jumps about from one topic to another. It can hardly be said to be confusion, it is a dreamy state of mind, a state of senility.
This remedy is useful when such a state is found in young persons, when the mind is not insane and yet it is weak. Especially is it indicated in those persons who manifest a momentary, fleeting inquisitiveness, jumping from one subject to another.
Often a patient asks me one question after another, never waiting to have the first one answered, a flitting, flighty talker, who does not seem to realize that I have not answered his questions; that patient, I say to myself, needs Ambra grisea.
That state of mind belongs to modern society women in such great frequency that you will be astonished to note it on all hands.
A modern society belle that could not darn the heel of her stocking to save her soul will in a few years get into just that state, and even Ambra will not cure her.
But there is a kind of nervous sickness manifested by these symptoms that Ambra grisea will cure. Alternation of depression of spirits with vehemence of temper is an other feature. That naturally belongs to old age.
A period of greatest excitability is often followed by depression, a state of indifference to all things, to joy, to grief, to people etc., treating with indifference things that would naturally break the heart of a well- balanced person.
He does not even wonder why he is not excited over these wonderful things, so decided is the state of indifference. Many of the complaints are worse in the morning.
He gets up with confusion and dullness of mind and is in a dreamy state and towards evening he takes on symptoms of insanity.
Vertigo: Ambra is one of the most frequently indicated medicines in simple, nondescript vertigo of old men.
So dizzy that they cannot go out on the street; so dizzy upon getting up in the morning that they must wait a while until they can get a-round on their feet. It is the dizziness belonging to senility and to premature old age.
Mind: Now, when this man undertakes to meditate upon something his ideas are whisked away. It is a sort of confusion with vanishing of ideas.
He has to make an unusual effort a few times to bring his thoughts back to the place before he can concentrate the mind to meditate upon some idea.
But while concentration of the mind is difficult, he is compelled to sit and dwell upon the most disagreeable things that force themselves upon him and he cannot get rid of them.
It is somewhat analogous to Natrum mur., but the peculiar feature of the Natr. mur. is that she delights to dwell upon past unpleasant occurrences and lies awake at night thinking about them.
Ambra grisea is forced to dwell upon such things. Images, false faces, hideous imaginations, fancies and visions annoy him and keep him awake.
In the semi-dreamy state he is kept holding up before his mind these grimaces. Such a state of mind may come on from business embarrassments with vertigo, congestion to the head and brain fag.
One thing running through this remedy is that the presence of other persons aggravates the symptoms; also the marked aggravation from conversation.
A woman, when attended by a nurse, is unable to have a stool without sending the nurse into another room. In spite of much straining she can do nothing unless alone.
It is said in Natr. mur. that the patient cannot urinate in the presence of other persons.
The urine will not start when anyone is around. That is a port of general feature of this remedy. Confusion of mind and embarrassment in the presence of other persons. Embarrassment in company. As soon as he goes into company there is flushing, trembling, nervous excitement and the thoughts vanish.
With these symptoms the patient imagines that he is going out of his mind, and finally he settles down into a state of melancholy, sadness and despair, and does not want to live. He loathes his life and wants to die.
"Great sadness." "Melancholy, sits for days weeping."
Such is the mental state of this prematurely old patient with broken down constitution. It is a picture of a wreck and the question will arise when you find a patient that looks and acts in this way whether you have received him in time to cure him.
You readily see you have before you one who is going down hill and going into insanity of one form or another. A physician sees the forerunner of a great breakdown when he sees an Ambra grisea patient with the nervous mental state, the quivering, trembling and excitement in one who was once a strong, vigorous man.
Some great business or domestic shock has come upon this patient. It is not the aspect you see when phthisis is coming on; you do not we the cachectic condition, but it is a prostration of the nervous system, a mental prostration.
A man goes through the trial of one death after another in the family and there seems to be nothing remaining; he cannot look at it philosophically; he has lost his business and his friends and then he takes on dreaminess and wonders whether life is worthing living.
Then it is you get the Ambra grisea aspect.
Modalities: Many of the complaints come on in the morning and many come on after eating. "Vertigo with feeling of weight on vertex; worse after sleep," but especially in the morning.
It is not mentioned in the text, but it is also worse after eating.
"Had to lie down on account of vertigo and feeling of weakness in stomach."
Running through the nervous symptoms we have music is intolerable; music makes him tremble, aggravates his mental symptoms and gives him pain in the back as from a hammer.
A number of physical symptoms are brought out by listening to music. The tones seem as if they were a material substance taking hold of him.
Complaints are often one-sided; perspiration on one side of the body or perspiration on the affected side. "On right side of head, a spot where hair when touched pains as if sore."
The same sensation is in the skip, oversensitive to touch.
"Scalp feels sore in the morning when awaking; this is followed by a sensation of numbness."
The word numbness you will find running through the complaints.
You will find a peculiar kind of numbness, such as belongs to old people. Diminished sensibility of the parts; feeble circulation.
Eyes: Again, we find under the eye symptoms, "Dullness of vision as if from looking through a mist."
There is dimness of vision coming on without any condition in the eye that would justify it. It is a nervous dimness of vision, a senile paralysis coming on.
"Itching on eyelid as if a sty was forming.” Itching is felt all over the body; itching in all the little openings. Among the symptoms that, are not in the text and that are decided symptoms belonging to this remedy are,
"Pressing headache starting from both temples, drawing and tearing in the head, to and fro. Shooting through the head, lancinating, cutting pains, worse on exertion, better from quiet and lying. Headache when blowing nose.
Pressing pain in the left frontal eminence and in the eye. Burning in the right eye and in the eye-lids. Tearing in short streaks in and upon the right eye, pressure on the left eye-brow, shooting, aggravated after eating; lachrymation."
These are in the original provings, but not in the text; they have been left out. This is the case all through the Guiding Symptoms; important symptoms were left out because it was necessary to cut down the work.
Hearing: "Hearing decreases."
Dullness of hearing without any organic affection of the ear. So perverted is his ability to hear that music aggravates his symptoms, that is through the nerves of hearing.
"Listening to music brings on congestion to head."
Music aggravates his cough. Think of one commencing to cough simply because he hears music! What a strange thing that is! Calcarea has such sensitiveness that the stroke of the piano is painful in parts, especially in the larynx.
Bleeding: This remedy is full of bleeding.
Copious bleeding from the nose in the morning. There we get the morning aggravation again. We get the idea of the feeble circulation because of the easy oozings from mucous membranes.
"Copious nose bleed early in bed." "Dried blood gathered’ in nose." "Long continued dryness of the nose, frequent irritation as from sneezing."
In the nose an old, dry catarrh with atrophic condition of the mucous membrane. The nose inside becomes shiny and withered.
Mouth and throat: Dryness of the mouth without thirst.
Biting pain in the throat between the acts of swallowing. Rawness in the throat. The throat complaints are worse in the morning. Complaints are worse after eating and worse from warm drinks, especially from warm milk.
"After eating, cough and gagging.”
There is a peculiar combination of symptoms about the throat. Dryness and accumulation of mucus in the throat which he tries to expel, and, when making an effort to cough out the mucus he gags and sometimes vomits.
Stomach and abdomen: Vomiting from cough. Weakness at the pit of the stomach; after every evacuation; in "all-gone"” feeling in the pit of the stomach.
Pressure deep in the region of the liver; worse in the morning; worse after eating; worse after stool. Distension of the abdomen with great flatulence, especially after eating.
Some symptoms are worse after drinking. Sometimes these complaints come on in the middle of the night, rousing him up with rumbling and cutting in the bowels.
The abdomen is cold; it feels as if the whole inside of the abdomen were cold. At other times the coldness seems to be on one side of the abdomen.
Inveterate constipation in old persons, and especially when it is impossible to have anyone near at the time, of stool.
"Frequent ineffectual desire for stool; this makes her very anxious; at this time presence of other persons becomes unbearable."
After the normal stool there is pressure in the abdomen or a sense of emptiness and weakness in the abdomen which is better after passing flatus or eructation.
Urines: Bloody urine with red sediment in the urine.
Urine when emitted is clouded, yellowish-brown and deposits a brownish sediment. "Sour smelling urine." The urine is copious.
"During urination burning, smarting, itching and titillation in the urethra and vulva." "Sore rawness between the thighs."
"Voluptuous itching on scrotum."
"Violent morning erections without desire,” with numbness of the genitals.
The symptoms are most erratic, as much so, as in Ignatia and Natr. mur. Taken as a whole they can be reconciled, but taken a few at a time they seem wonderfully inconsistent. You must get the whole remedy in order to comprehend it.
Female: Copious discharge of blood between the menstrual periods. "Discharge of blood between periods at every little accident."
Discharge of blood from the vagina from pressing at hard stool; even from a walk that is a little too long or from too great exertion.
"During menses left leg becomes quite blue from distended varices, with pressive pain in leg." "Lying down aggravates uterine symptoms,” quite an unexpected thing.
Menses too early and too profuse.
"Menses appear seven days before time,” and then comes that horrible itching of the genitals;
"soreness and itching with swelling of labia."
Asthma: Another marked feature of this remedy that you might expect with all this nervous excitement and prostration is dyspnoea with cardiac symptoms, difficult breathing, a sort of asthma. It comes on from any little exertion.
Asthma on attempting coition, "Itching, scraping and soreness in larynx and trachea." "Titillation in throat, larynx and trachea."
Everywhere there is itching, and the itching is very often a form of crawling.
"Asthma of old people and children," in feeble, tremulous, weakly ones. "Whistling chest during breathing."
"Spasmodic cough."
Violent spasmodic cough with frequent eructations and hoarseness,"
A good deal of this cough is of nervous origin. It is a cough with excitement, with nervousness, with trembling, which would make one of considerable experience wonder if that patient did not have brain and spinal cord trouble.
Nervous cough, such as occurs often, in spinal irritation. Cough from constriction of the larynx followed by copious flow of white mucus.
This is a paroxysmal cough, much like whooping cough. Asthmatic dyspnoea from any little exertion, from music, from excitement. Cough with congestion of blood to the head. Cough from thinking and from anxiety.
It is not very long after these symptoms show themselves before this patient will emaciate and wither. until the skin looks like dried beef. With all he is a tremulous and shaky patient.
He complains a great deal of tearing pressure deep in the left side of the chest. Sensation of rawness in the chest and itching in the chest. Titillation and itching, moving about here and there if he tries to touch the place and scratch it.
You will not be surprised to know that this patient suffers from palpitation of the heart upon slight exertion, from excitement, from music, from any effort to put the mind on anything, with trembling and quivering.
And this palpitation he notices even to the extremities; he throbs all over. His extremities pulsate. He is conscious of his arteries everywhere and the palpitation of his heart causes oppression of breathing.
The limbs easily become numb; pressed upon in the slightest manner they go to sleep; go to sleep on being crossed. Coldness, trembling and stiffness of the extremities. The finger nails become brittle and are shriveled.
The arms go to sleep when lying down.
"Sore and raw between the thighs and in hollow of knees."
Heaviness of lower limbs, Paralytic weakness; the patient is growing old; senility is coming on.
This remedy has cured the premature trembling that comes on in middle-aged persons.
It has cured the "going to sleep" and numbness and feeble circulation with loss of muscular power. It is very suitable in children who are excitable and nervous and weak.

"In lean persons." "Old persons and children."
Ammonium Carbonicum
Generalities: If we were practicing in the old-fashioned way and considered the wonderfully volatile nature of Ammonium carb. in some of its forms we would only look upon it as an agent to relieve fainting and simple affections and use it in the form of hartshorn to comfort old maids and some other women.
But Ammonium carb. is a deep-acting, constitutional medicine, an anti-psoric. It effects rapid blood changes, it disturbs the whole economy and it establishes a scorbutic constitution. Its fluids are all acrid.
The saliva becomes acrid and excoriates the lips, so that they crack in the corners and middle, and become raw and dry and scabby.
The eye-lids fester and become dry and cracked from the excoriating fluids from the eye. The stool is acrid and excoriates.
The genitals of the female become raw and sore from the acrid menstrual discharge and leucorrhoea, and wherever there is an ulcer upon the skin the fluids that ooze from it excoriate the parts round about, this excoriating character belonging to all of the exuding fluids and discharges.
This remedy has bleeding of black blood, often fluid blood, that will not coagulate, flowing from the nose, the uterus, the bladder and bowels.
The blood is dark, showing that a great disturbance is taking place in the circulation. The skin has a mottled appearance intermingled with great pallor.
It produces a violent action upon the heart, in which there is audible palpitation, and every motion aggravates the pulsation. With this is associated great prostration.
It is rather a strange coincidence that the ancients know that Amm. carb. would overcome difficult breathing from cardiac attacks and that aqua ammonia or hartshorn is used today to a certain extent in indications similar to those mentioned.
They use it as a stimulant, but when indicated the single dose very high is enough.
The ancients knew enough, also, to use hartshorn in the low forms of pneumonia, at the turning point in the advanced stage; that is an old allopathic practice, but it had a homoeopathic relation to some of the cases.
Once in a while they would cure a patient in the awful stage of prostration with heart failure at the end of pneumonia, and because they relieved such a one it was then established as a remedy for all future use.
Ammonium carb. has a state analogous to blood poisoning, such as we find in erysipelas and in the most malignant forms of scarlet fever, with prostration, great dyspnoea, so that it seems as if the heart were giving out.
With this there is an unusual patchy condition of the surface, due to the paralytic condition of the blood vessels, enlargement of the glands, duskiness and puffiness of the face.
Amm. carb. has been used allopathically in just such a state for centuries and it has demonstrated its homeopathic relations by its efficacy.
Heart: It belongs to the simple enfeeblement, weak heart, emaciation. There is quite an absence of symptoms and a lack of response to remedies.
The patient must lie in bed because of the palpitation and difficult breathing on motion. It is a matter of mere weakness. Such a case furnished me much amusement for a year and a half.
There was a woman in this city who answered just such a description; her state was one of peculiar cardiac weakness with dyspnoea and palpitation on motion; I had been treating the case, but had not fully studied it, and as she did not progress under my management she was taken out of my hands and taken to one of our most able neurologists, who put her upon the "rest cure" and promised that in six weeks she would be perfectly well.
But at the end of six weeks she was worse than ever and a cardiac specialist was then brought to examine her.
He said it was true the heart was not vigorous, but there was no organic affection and consequently the case did not belong to his branch.
Then a lung specialist was brought in, and later she was examined by all kinds of specialists. All of her organs were fully investigated, and it was announced that nothing was the matter with them; but the poor woman could not walk because of her sufferings and palpitating heart.
She had a little dry, backing cough that did not amount to anything, but her chest was examined and there was nothing wrong with it.
But after she bad been in this continual fire for about three months, and was steadily failing, the side of the family that were my adherents prevailed against the others and I went to see her again.
I continued to study the case, which was extremely vague, having nothing but those few symptoms, and finally I settled upon Ammonium carb., and she has been on this remedy for eighteen months.
She now climbs mountains, she does everything she wants to do and is about ready to go to housekeeping.
She has grown from a case of nervous prostration, brain fag and any other diagnosis that might have been heaped upon her to a well woman, and under that one remedy.
This shows you how deeply this remedy acts. One dose generally acts upon her for from six weeks to two months, steadily improving her each time.
Exhaustion coming at every menstrual period. An attack of cholera, or what one might mistake for cholera, coming the first day of the menses; a copious diarrhea.
Sometimes it is an exhaustion with vomiting, exhaustion as in Veratrum, with coldness, blueness, sinking, dyspnoea.
Asthma: The kind of dyspnoea that I have been speaking of up to this time is not an asthmatic dyspnoea; it is a cardiac dyspnoea due to a weak heart; but this remedy has also asthma, and in the asthma there is this peculiarity: if the room is warm the dyspnoea increases until suffocation seems imminent; as if he would die for want of breath.
He is compelled to go out into the cold air for relief. While the warm room increases the dyspnoea in asthmatic complaints the bodily state of the patient is worse from cold.
The complaints of the body and the headaches are worse from cold.
Bones: A common thing running through this remedy is aching in the bones. The bones ache as if they would break. The teeth ache violently from every change of weather or from change of the temperature in the mouth. The jaws ache or the roots of the teeth ache.
A prominent feature is falling out of the hair, the finger nails become yellowish, the gums settle away from the teeth and bleed, the teeth become loose, all in keeping with the scorbutic constitution.
Hysteria: This remedy has hysteria, and it is not surprising that nervous women carry a bottle of ammonia hanging to their chain.
Many women do this because as soon as they go into a close place they faint and must use their hartshorn.
This condition in the woman, if in a mild degree, is not hysterical; it belongs to the sensitive nature of women; but if carried to a more marked state. It is hysterical.
The hysterical fainting will be averted by the use of the hartshorn. Amm. carb. will stimulate the action of the heart and relieve.
Depression: The remedy is full of depression of spirits. She weeps much, has fainting fits, anxiety, uneasiness and exhaustion from motion. Over sensitive about what she hears other people saying.
Complaints from listening to others talking. Complaints, both mental and physical, are worse in the wet weather, and she is sensitive to cold, raw, wet weather.
The gouty complaints. nervous complaints, prostration, cardiac complaints, dyspnoea, headaches, etc., come on in raw weather.
Headache: A congestive headache comes on in wet weather and from weather changes. Sensation as if the brain would ooze out through the forehead and eyes.
"Pulsating, beating in the forehead as if it would burst." The headache is worse from stepping, especially the head aches that come at the menstrual period.
Headache worse in the morning. This medicine. in such headaches, with the symptoms I have described, shows its antidotal relation to Lachesis, because Lachesis produces all this state of prostration.
In the old text-books you will notice this expression, "Inimical to Lachesis."
This means when Lachesis has been given in high potency and has acted curatively, Ammonium carb. is not likely to act curatively after it, and is, some times capable of disturbing the case, confusing it and mixing up the symptoms.
But when Lach. has been given in too low potency, and the patient has been poisoned with the crude Medicine, this remedy then becomes an antidote, used in a high potency, because of the similarity in its action.
It will, overcome many of the poisonous symp toms of the case. If you will examine the appearance of people who have been bitten by snakes and then examine the pathogenesis of this remedy you will see a great similarity between them.
It is well known that this remedy has had repeated use in snake bites. Evidently it did not save all of them, but it must have done something, for these cases or it would not have established so great a reputation for itself.
Give it not as an antidote per se, but when indicated in blood-poisoning and animal bites with zymosis, with a tendency to black liquid bleeding, as in Elaps.
Running through the snake poisons there is a tendency to bleeding of black blood that will not coagulate. Eyes: It has many eye symptoms.
Sparks before the eyes in connection with headaches; double vision; aversion to light.
"Large black spot floats before the eyes after sewing."
When these symptoms have been present in such a constitutional state as I have, described the remedy has cured cataract; it has, cured the patient and finally the crystalline lens has cleared up.
Burning of the eyes, smarting eyes blood-shot eyes.
It disturbs the hearing, causing hardness of hearing and discharge of acrid fluid from the ears. Nose: We have had scorbutic, catarrhal condition of the nose, such as described.
Discharge from the nose acrid.
"Severe pain as if the brain were forcing itself out just above nose."
"Nose-bleed when washing face or hands in morning."
It has many complaints from bathing, and a prominent feature is that the skin is covered with red, mottled spots after bathing.
Bathing produces surging all over, here and there, as well as nose-bleed. Palpitation is worse from bathing.
In the throat we have an appearance like malignant scarlet fever, diphtheria and other zymotic state; purple, swollen, ulcerated and bleeding, and gangrenous, accompanied by great exhaustion, with enlarged tonsils and glands.
The glands outside of the throat and neck are enlarged and felt as lumps. In diphtheria, when the nose is stopped, the child starts from sleep gasping for breath. Here again we observe its relation to Lachesis and the ophidia, for soon after the patient drops to sleep he wakes up suffocating, in diphtheria, in chest troubles with great prostration, the patient is worse after sleep.
Menses: Menses too soon.
"The menstrual blood is blackish, often in clots." The leucorrhoea is acrid,
"Violent tearing in abdomen and vagina." "Irritation of clitoris."
Swelling of the genitals. Now, let me tell you something not mentioned here, but important, and that is a sensation of soreness in the whole pelvic viscera; at times it seems as if all her inner parts were raw.
It is a sensation of soreness; not always sore to touch. This sensation of deep-seated soreness is especially felt during menstruation.
All through the menstrual period soreness and rawness.
"Menses premature, abundant, blackish, often in clots, preceded by griping and colic."
Chest: The remedy is full of catarrhal symptoms and cough, with much rattling of mucus in the chest and air passages.
Oppression of breathing, a catarrhal dyspnoea. Especially is this a remedy, when the symptoms agree, in hypostatic congestion of the lungs, a filling up of the chest with mucus which it is difficult to expel; great rattling in the chest and great weakness.
It is a good palliative in the last stages of consumption. A dose of Ammonium carb. when there is great coldness, prostration and weakness in the chest.
It is not unlike that sensation of weakness in the chest which is like Stannum. He can hardly cough out loud and because of the weakness he cannot expel the mucus, like Ant. tart., Short asthmatic cough.
The complaints of this remedy come on especially at three o'clock in the morning. The cough comes on at that time. Old people who suffer from catarrh of the chest have an aggravation at three o'clock in the morning with the palpitation and prostration, waking up at that hour with cold sweat and dyspnoea.
Almost pulseless; weakness of the heart. Face pale and cold.
"Great lassitude." Defective reaction with, or at the close of severe zymotic troubles, typhoid, diphtheria, scarlet fever, erysipelas, etc.
In those complaints that should come to a crisis, if the patient goes into a state of great exhaustion under remedies fairly well selected, you have an instance where this medicine competes with Arsenicum for the nervous prostration.
You see "heart failure” spoken of in old school literature. They say the patient got along very nicely, but finally died of heart failure.
In a great many instances if Ammonium carb. were given in time it would save life. "Averse to walking in open air."
"Children dislike washing."
The warmth of the bed relieves the rheumatic pains, relieves the chill.
"In a warm room the headache is better."
"From washing reappearance of the symptoms; nose-bleed; blue hands; swollen veins." "Worse in cold air."
Skin: We come now to the appearance of the skin:
"Body red as if covered with scarlatina."
"Putrid flat ulcers with a pungent sensation."
"Malignant scarlatina with somnolence, starting from sleep."
"Erysipelas of old people when cerebral symptoms are developed."
Whenever treating a severe form of disease and an eruption comes to the surface, like a carbuncle or erysipelas, and does not give relief to the patient then there is danger.
A remedy must be found soon. When a patient is coming down with severe internal troubles it is not a very uncommon thing for unhealthy looking boils to come out, or carbuncles or erysipelas blotches.
It is always serious when these are not immediately followed by relief to the patient.
It shows a pernicious state that has been pent up and cannot be held any longer and this violence is going to destroy.
This is one of the remedies that you may look for to check the progress of such states.
Any remedy, of course, which corresponds to the totality of the symptoms is the remedy to administer.
Ammonium Muriaticum
Generalities: The patient frequently feels a boiling throughout the body as if in the blood vessel.
Sensitive to cold. Many complaints increase while in the open air. Flushes of heat, ending in sweat. Tearing pains and smarting prevail extensively. Burning and excoriation of mucous membranes. Drawing or sensation of shortening of tendons. It is a long-acting remedy.
Mind: There are few reliable mental symptoms known. Anxiety, fretfulness and antipathy to certain persons. Neuralgic and, rheumatic pains in the head. Tearing pains in the head.
Head: Stitching and tearing in the temples. Itching of the scalp and other parts. Rash all over body like measles.

Nose and coryza: Much sneezing, watery burning discharge, yet stoppage of nose. Coryza with burning in larynx. It has been used extensively in traditional medicine for coryza. Some sore throat and inflammation of the larynx.
For these troubles in olden times the large chunk of sal ammoniac was produced, a few crystals shaved off with a common jack knife into a glass of water. All got the same thing, regardless of symptoms.
Some were cured promptly of these bad colds, with or without fever. It is now an overlooked remedy. Its symptoms should be carefully studied.
Face: With many of its complaints there is much pallor of the face. Tearing in the bones of the face. Swelling of the submaxillary and parotid glands with stitching pains.
Mouth: Burning and excoriation of mouth and lips, like Am. c. Tongue swollen. It is a very useful remedy for nondescript sore throat; but especially useful where there is marked burning and much viscid mucus, pulsating in the neck and glands of neck, great swelling, pale face, stitching in the throat, great pain on swallowing, with or without thirst.
Stomach: Eructations of food as eaten, and vomiting. Sensation of hunger with fullness, which is a flatulent state. Empty feeling, gnawing in the stomach and spleen. Burning, stitching, tearing pains in the abdomen.

If the reader will take up the provings and study them carefully he should be able to use this remedy in the direction pointed out, and most likely would see uses not mentioned.
Anacardium Orientale
Mind: This remedy is full of strange notions and ideas.
The mind appears to be feeble; almost, if not complete imbecility; seems as if in a dream; everything is strange; slow to comprehend. Marked irritability; disturbed by everything; cursing.
Weak memory. Forgetful of things in his mind but a moment ago. All his senses seem to vanish and he gropes around as if in a dream.
Change of states; after states. Dullness and sluggishness of the mind prevail. He is in a continuous controversy with himself. Irresolution marks his character. He cannot settle between doing this and that, he hesitates and often does nothing. He cannot decide, especially in an action of good or evil.
He hears voices commanding him to do this or that, and seems to be between a good and an evil will. He is persuaded by his evil will to do acts of violence and injustice, but is withheld and restrained by a good will. So there is a controversy between two wills, between two impulses. When this is really analyzed by one who knows something of the nature of man it will be seen that the man is disturbed in his external will, but the internal will cannot be affected by medicine.
His external voluntary is continuously excited by external influences, but his real will, in which is his conscience, restrains that and keeps him from carrying the impulses into effect. This can only be observed when its action is on a really good man. He has a controversy when his external will is aroused, but in an evil man there is no restraint and be will not have this symptom.
Hallucinations: a demon sits on one shoulder and an angel on the other.
He is disposed to malice and has an irresistible desire to curse and swear. Laughs when he should be serious. So it is carried on until all things in the external will are inverted. Internal anxiety, i. e., the internal will is in a turmoil. over this external disturbance.
"Contradiction between will and reason" is an attempt to express what the individual knew nothing about. "Feels as though he had two wills."
That is better. It finally destroys or paralyzes the external will, and when a man is naturally evil and is under the paralyzing influence of Anacardium he will do acts of violence.
A wicked man is restrained, not by his conscience, but by fear of the law. Anacardium paralyzes the external will arid places him in a position of imbecility, and he does acts of violence from his own natural perverted self It has so acted on a portion of the mind that it teaches a great deal.
I have learned much from Anac., Aurum and Argentum of the strange action of medicines on the human mind.
Psychology must be figured out by the action of drugs on the human mind. By this means we get at facts and can lay aside many hypotheses.
Ideas as if nothing were real, all seems to be a dream. Fixed ideas. He thinks he is double. This comes from a vague consciousness that there is a difference between the external and internal will, a consciousness that one will is the body and another is the mind.
Dwells on thoughts about salvation. That a stranger is by his side, is another recognition of the two wills. That strange forms accompany him, one to his right side and one to his left. This mental state drives him to madness.
Alternation of his moods and understanding. One moment he sees a thing and another moment he does not understand it. One moment she sees it is her child and another that it is not. One moment it is a delusion and next moment it is an illusion.
One moment thinks it is so and next moment has enough reason left that it is not so .
Delusion is an advanced stage of illusion.
In the Repertory we have the same remedies often in illusion and delusion, it is a matter of grade. When the intellect is slightly affected it is an illusion, and what he sees he knows is not so.
He sees demons, and at first he knows from his intelligence that a demon is not there, but later, he wants you to drive him out.
It does not matter which, they are similar symptoms, and it is a matter of degree, and so, in the Repertory, delusions and illusions are not given separate places.
Anac., Hyos., Stram, and Bell., are important in bringing out the quality of the perverted human mind as to the intelligence and affections.
Whenever a medicine makes a man desire to do something it affects his will, and when it affects his intelligence it is acting on his understanding. Medicines act on both.
Low-spirited, disheartened, fears be is pursued, looks for thieves, expects enemies, fears everything and everybody.
Full of internal anxiety. No peace. He is separated from the whole world, and he despairs to do that which is required of him. Cowardly in the extreme.
Fears some dreadful thing will happen. Morose, sulky, sullen.
Unsocial; complains of weak memory. Slight causes make him excessively angry. A strong feature is that all moral feeling is taken out of him. He feels cruel. Can do bodily injury without feeling.
Cruel, malicious, wicked.
Bad effects of mental excitement. Weak-minded. Consequences of fright and mortification. Suitable in religious mania when the conflict between the external and internal will is kept up. It is analogous to Hyos.
Many complaints are ameliorated by eating.
Sensation here and there of pressure, described as if a plug, all through the body, in the head, eyes, in the navel and down the spine.
Objects appear too far off. Things have a strange look, sometimes uncanny. Illusions of smell, burning timber, pigeon's dung.
Chronic dry coryza.
The whole body has been well covered by symptoms; but it seems that the mind represents the principal aspect, and A will seldom be used excepting for such mind symptoms.
Usually when the mental symptoms are strong the physical are also covered by the remedy.
Full of trembling and paralytic weakness. Tetanus; epilepsy. Sensations as of a hoop or band around the body, limbs or head; pressing as of a plug.
Skin: The eruptions are like Rhus in many respects; erysipelatous eruptions dark, dusky and of malignant types.
It is an antidote to Rhus poisoning.
Eruptions all over. Yellow vesicles are common. Intense itching of eruptions. Warts on the palms like Natrum mur. Skin burns much. It seems closely related in its symptoms to all the Rhus family.
Antimonium Crudum
Generalities: You will be surprised, when studying full provings of this substance, to notice that all the symptoms seem to centre about the stomach; it does not matter much what kind of complaints he suffers from the stomach takes part in it.
The pains disturb his stomach and bring, on nausea; with his headache he is sick at the stomach; with all complaints his stomach is out of order, and, on the other band, whenever he disorders his stomach he is sick all over. Complaints that manifest themselves through the stomach very frequently need this medicine.
First in importance are the mental symptoms showing the type of constitution likely to need this remedy. It produces a very serious state in the mind, an absence of the desire to live. It is well known to physicians that the case is a serious one if the patient has no desire to live; life is a burden. When I hear a patient say:
"Oh, doctor, if I could only die."
I do not like such a case; there is some deep-seated trouble in the economy that is hard to remove. Something is threatening, and when it comes it is a common thing to see the patient actually die.
"Loathing of life."
You will find this especially in a low, lingering, continued fever, such as typhoid. This remedy has all the prostration of typhoid, and it has the continued type of fever as well as the intermittent and remittent. The prostration is similar to Arsenicum, but Ars. have overwhelming fear of death, while this medicine has loathing of life; and so they both part company. Ars, has overwhelming restlessness, this remedy is seldom restless. Ars. has an intense thirst, this medicine is thirstless.
So even though both these remedies have excessive exhaustion with continued fever, we see they have features dissimilar enough to make them wholly distinct. Such a typhoid will sometimes be seen in young girls about puberty who are threatening to go into chlorosis. They have loathing of life, but it is a hysterical loathing of life.
Moments of great exhaustion, sudden attacks of weakness and fainting. You will commonly find another feature with this, not coming at the same moment. but alternating with it, or only present at times, namely, these over excitable, intense, nervous, hysterical, ecstatic young girls and women are overcome by mellow lights such as flow through stained glass windows or the mellow light from the moon in the evening.
That is, what is meant when it says in the text:
"Sentimental mood in the moonlight."
It is a hysterical state, a disorderly outburst of the affections, such affections as can be aroused only in one who is sick, or one who is unbalanced in the general nervous system.
This kind of patient gives us the mental state and constitution of Ant. crud., and along with such mental states the physical conditions seems to strike to the stomach, as it were.
We have running through this remedy a general state that you should keep in mind, that is, a gouty or rheumatic state, in which the symptoms change with the changes of the weather; worse in cold, damp weather, worse from cold bathing, better from the heat of a hot bath, worse from taking sour wine, and worse from stimulants of any kind.
When you use the expression "worse from wine,” it is not only important to know that the patient is worse from wine, but also the character of complaints that are worse from wine.
This patient becomes easily intoxicated, but the physical symptoms are more disturbed than the mental; his gouty symptoms are worse from sour wine; all the pains and aches of the body are worse from sour wine; headaches come from this cause and the gastric disturbances are greatly aggravated from sour wine.
This patient is worse at night, worse in damp weather, worse from damp cold, better from lying down quietly, better from applied heat, but much worse from over-heating and from radiated heat, and in a warm room.
Many of the symptoms come on in the sun's rays and from the heat of an open grate. The open fire is wholly against the Ant. crud. patient.
A child with whooping cough will cough more after looking into the fire. Such things are queer; they are so strange that there is no philosophical hypothesis to explain them, no theory that looks toward an explanation, but they are facts which we must accept.
Gout: The whole gouty nature of the case seems to change so suddenly that you wonder where the more exterior symptoms have gone to, for all at once in a night or a day the patient commences to vomit and you have persistent vomiting, lasting days and weeks, until the gouty symptoms come back into the extremities.
It is wonderful how quickly this old-fashioned metastasis will come on, this changing from one place to another. The gout suddenly ceases in the extremities and stomach symptoms come on, and you may call it gout in the stomach if you will.
Catarrhal symptoms: There are catarrhal symptoms in this remedy; catarrh of the nose, stomach, rectum, etc., and an increased flow of mucus from any of these localities from drinking sour wine and from taking cold.
A distressing feature of the catarrh is the stuffing up of the nose at night. As soon as he gets into an overheated room, his nose gets stuffed lip.
The coryza has a tendency to become chronic, because of the low and feeble circulation and the poor constitution.
When it becomes chronic it is worse at night and is associated-with headaches. As the catarrh slackens up and becomes dry the headache becomes worse; he has neuralgia in the head, crushing pains and dreadful sickness at the stomach with vomiting.
He often has an attack of sick headache and it will be called by the family a gastric sick headache, but the condition just mentioned comes on from taking cold, which slacks up the thick discharge into a dryness of the nose and the inhaled air burns the nose like fire.
Sometimes these troubles pass off after an intense vomiting spell; sometimes they do not, but the headache may remain for days not relieved by vomiting, or relieved only after prolonged vomiting.
Headache: There are remedies full of headache and as soon as ho vomits he feels better, but in this remedy he vomits long, and becomes relaxed and exhausted.
The headache is worse moving about, worse at night better from lying down, from keeping quiet, better in the open air, worse in warm room, worse from overheating, worse from radiated heat and light. You see now how the catarrh, the headache and gastric symptoms all belong together.
It is because the patient is sick that you cannot take symptoms separately, you must prescribe for the whole man.
There is another feature belonging to the mucous membranes, and an important one; these membranes have a tendency to throw out a milky white exudation or deposit, and it is especially noticed upon the tongue.
Mucous membranes: The whole tongue is covered with a milk-white coating. This you find in all diseases where the remedy is indicated.
In the stomach disorders of children, in gastric fevers, in complaints with fever and much vomiting great irritation of the whole nervous system and in irritation of the stomach in typhoids, the tongue looks white. Upon the slightest provocation he will retch and gag.
Every thing seems to disturb him. He has loathing of food; the thought and smell of food disturb him. This is like Arsenicum.
Voice and larynx: He takes a cold bath at night on going to bed and gets up in the morning voiceless cannot speak a word.
This has come on in an apparently painless manner; he does not know that it is present until he attempts to speak in the morning. This may be present with spasms, of the larynx clutchings of the throat. Colds sometimes go down into the throat and into the trachea, producing a bronchitis or pneumonia.
Cough: Dry, hacking spasmodic cough in diminishing paroxysms.
I will explain that: The first paroxysm occurs with great violence, racking his whole frame, and lasting a longer or shorter period, to be followed by one with less violence and another with less violence; perhaps after a dozen or less paroxysms of diminishing violence, he ends up with a dry, hacking cough which is not a paroxysm.
When this first cough shakes the whole body, whether it is a bronchitis or whooping cough, and the tongue is white, and there are more or less gastric disturbances, Ant. crud. is the remedy.
It will change the whole aspect of the case at once. The chest remains sore, lame and bruised from the violence of the cough.
Stomach: The stomach symptoms must be particularly considered.
Constant nausea, lump in the stomach, feeling all the time as if he had an overloaded stomach, as if he had eaten too much, and that is when he had not eaten at all.
The stomach feels distended although the abdomen is flat. He feels distended and vomits the contents of the stomach; he vomits slime after he has emptied the stomach of its contents; prolonged retching, nausea, sickening load in the stomach and it seems to go on and on.
The vomiting does not relieve and there is increasing exhaustion. Liver: Inflammation and hardness of the liver or any portion of it.
Pain in the region of the gall bladder. Great pain in the region of the liver, rending, tearing pains in the liver, jaundice is associated with these symptoms at times.
Abdomen: In the abdomen we have a group of symptoms; violent abdominal pains, burning, great distension; there appears to be an increasing distension as if by a screw, gradually forcing down upon something gradually increasing the tension.
We find this state in the tympanitic condition of typhoid fever, we find it in cases of flatulence, we find it in summer diarrheas.
It will be associated with gastric symptoms and the white tongue, especially if such disturbance had been brought on by drinking sour wine, by taking a cold bath, in one who has a gouty constitution, where the nodules in the finger joints become painless and the stomach and bowels become distended and painful.
Diarrhea: This remedy has a nondescript diarrhea, but also a lumpy and liquid diarrhea. Diarrhea from sour wine. It seems to take a long time to empty the bowels. He hurries to stool and passes a little lump and some liquid, and is soon hurried again to stool and more lumps and liquid are passed, and
this goes on in summer diarrheas until finally the bowel is emptied and then there is great tenesmus.
It is a diarrhea ending in dysentery; inflammation of the rectum and colon, with suffering, much tenesmus, prolonged efforts and great exhaustion.
Troublesome hemorrhoids in old gouty constitutions. They are always sore and inflamed from a cold, wet day, from cold bathing and, are always worse if he is foolish enough to drink sour wine or take sour food.
The stomach, bowel, rectum and hemorrhoidal complaints are all worse from disordering the stomach with sour wine, sour fruit or indigestible substances from cold bathing and wet weather.
Female: The pelvic viscera become greatly relaxed, especially in women, so much so that there is a dragging down in the pelvis.
It seems as though the contents of the pelvis would be expelled, or would fall out. There is prolapsus of the uterus and a discharge resembling leucorrhoea .
Disturbances of various kinds at the menstrual period.
Irritable and painful ovaries, such as we find associated with hysterical girls; those who suffer from unrequited affections; dreamers.
Sweat: This medicine produces sweating; copious, exhaustive sweats, night sweats, such as we find in lingering diseases.
Sweats from the slightest exertion. If he becomes slightly overheated he fairly boils with perspiration and then takes cold.
Skin: The skin is ulcerated and has a tendency to grow warts, callosities, bad nails and bad hair.
Hard, horny excrescences grow under the nail and are extremely painful. From the ends of the fingers little horn-like excrescences appear.
The slightest pressure will produce a callosity, or a sore place, and in working men you will find an unusual tendency to thickening of the skin on the soles of the feet.
They are very sore to walk upon, because these callous places are sensitive and have numerous centres of little corns. The tendency to build up and indurate belongs to the remedy.
Warts grow upon the hands. The hair is unhealthy. Pustules form upon the skin with red areola. Pustular eruptions have an inflamed base that is red, and sensitive.
Now, if you will study the proving and get the particulars of the remedy, and fit them into this framework, you will understand something of Ant. crud.
Antimonium Tartaricum
Face: About the first thing we see in the study of an Antimonium tart. patient is expressed in the face.
The face is pale and sickly; the nose is drawn and shrunken; the eyes are sunken and there are dark rings around the eyes.
The lips are pale and shriveled. The nostrils are dilated and flapping, and there is a dark, sooty appearance inside of the nostrils.
The face is covered with a cold sweat and is cold and pale. The expression is that of suffering. The atmosphere of the room is pungent, more pungent than foetid or putrid, and makes you feel that death is in it.
The family is disturbed; they are going hither and thither, and the nurse is in an excited and busy state, and you enter upon this scene to make a homoeopathic prescription.
It is one of excitement and one that you cannot act rapidly in, but one in which you must make a very quick prescription.
These things will interfere somewhat with your thinking at the time that you must do the best thinking and the most rapid thinking.
Now, in what kind of cases do we find this state and appearance, where all the features and symptoms conform to the nature of the remedy?
Catarrhal patients: First, in catarrhal patients, in broken down constitutions, in feeble children, in old people.
Catarrhal conditions of the trachea and the bronchial tubes. Our ears being open we hear coarse rattling and bubblings in the chest.
If you have ever been in the room of the dying you have heard what is called the death rattle. It is coarse like that.
Now and then there is expectoration of a mouthful of light-colored, whitish mucus. The condition is one in which the chest is steadily filling up with mucus, and at first he may be able to throw it out; but finally he is suffocating from the filling up of mucus and the inability of the chest and lungs to throw it out.
Lungs: It is a paralytic condition of the lungs. It may occur in cases of grippe. At first it may be a case that comes on quite rapidly, running a rapid course.
It may be a case that produces early prostration, that is, in three or four days or a week. The first few days of the sickness will not point to Antimonium tart.
So long as the reaction is good and his strength holds up you will not see this Hippocratic countenance, sinking, and coldness and cold sweat.
You will not hear this rattling in the chest, because these symptoms are symptoms, that indicate a passive condition.
Antimonium tart. has weakness and lack of reaction. Hence we see that it is suitable in those cases that present this state, or in such patients as are so feeble, when they are taken down, that they at once enter upon a passive or relaxed state.
Bronchitis: In cases of bronchitis with pneumonia, inflammation of the trachea, inflammation of the air passages in general, the inflammation is likely to be attended with dryness or a scanty flow of mucus.
If this be violent in a few days it will reach a state of relaxation and weakness. But the first state does not indicate Antimonium tart.
Such medicines as Bryonia and Ipecac. come in for the first period, and your impression is, when administering those medicines, that they will be sufficient for the whole case, and they will be, except in those states wherein this weakness is present from the beginning, or where there is lack of ability to react sufficiently from your remedy to recover under it.
Then comes in a second remedy, and that is the time when this medicine begins its operation. Ipecac. has some of this coarse rattling, but it is attended with great expulsive power of the lungs.
This medicine has the coarse rattling that comes after many days. Ipecac. has it the first days of the sickness. This remedy has the coughing and gagging and retching, but in the stage of great relaxation, prostration and coldness. It seems as if he will die.
When you hear him cough you are at once impressed with the idea that there must be some profound weakness in his lung power. We know that it is in the power of the lungs to produce an expulsive action with the deep inspirations.
They have no such power in Antimonium tart. The chest is full of mucous and it rattles; the cough is a rattling cough, but the mucus does not come up, or only a small quantity comes up, but it does not relieve him.
His chest is full of mucus, he is suffocating and he is really passing away, dying from carbonic acid poisoning due to a lack of expulsive power.
Pneumonia: In cases of pneumonia; when first coming down with a chill, it may be a very violent attack, such an attack as from its violence produced prostration early, that is, after three or four days.
It is not indicated in the beginning during the chill, and during the high grade of inflammation, but during the stage of exudation. But the violence of the attack leads him to a state of prostration, or he is already feeble as if he were old, and therefore he becomes easily relaxed and prostrated from the disease.
Altogether unlike Aconite, Bell., Ip.. and Bry., for they come down with violence - the very opposite is present in Antimonium tart.
Little fever, cold sweat, coldness, relaxation, Hippocratic aspect. So it is the remedy that closes out the scene with the severe cases of bronchitis, pneumonia; most of these cases die in an Antimonium tart. state.
This patient is an old gouty patient, debilitated from long illness, always shivering, pale, with enlarged joints. Every spell of wet weather brings on a catarrhal state of the chest, larynx and trachea which runs into a state of copious secretion of mucus.
He is in bed at once, prostrated, with coarse rattling.
Children: In children that have frequent attacks of bronchitis, from cold wet weather, from cold rainstorms in the autumn, in the spring and in cloudy weather.
No sooner do they get over one cold than another cold comes on. The acute stage is never violent with them, but they keep having these passive rattling colds. Recurrent rattling in the chest. Chilly, and pale.
Those florid children that do not look sick when they have a cold, are more or less vigorous, who have rattling in the chest, but do not come down with weakness and are not prostrated from it, but keep on rattling, they call for Kali sulph.
That is quite a distinguishing feature, the weakness at once speaks for this remedy.
Old people: In very old people this weakness occurs, old broken down people who have for years had catarth of the chest.
Every sharp cold spell in the winter brings on catarrh of the chest, with thick white mucus, and attended with great dyspnoea, driving him to bed. He must sit up in bed and be fanned; cannot lie down because of the difficult breathing, and filling up of the chest.
Antimonium tart. will, ease him over a number of these attacks before he dies. When the mucus is yellow and purulent in one of these old people, Ammoniacum will tide him over a good many winters. We see a good many old people that suffer from catarrh of the chest during the winter; they have had it for years, and do not expect to be any better.
When the expectoration is yellow, Ammoniacum will pull them through and Antimonium tart, when it is white and attended with prostration, sweat, coldness, pallor and blueness of the face. These are the principal uses of this remedy in practice.
Modalities: it has many pains and aches. To a great exent Ant. tart. builds upon the Antimonium crudum basis. It forms its chest symptoms to a great extent upon that basis.
Many of the symptoms are like Antimonium crudum; many symptoms are worse when warmed up, and from too much clothing. You will see this patient sitting up in bed with no clothing around the shoulders or neck, and the night-gown wide open in order to breathe. Suffocates if the room is too warm. It gets that from the Antimonium crud. It is worse from bathing in cold water, like Antimonium crud. The mucous membranes are covered with thick white mucus, like Antimonium. crud. Also he does not want to be meddled with or bothered. Everything is a burden.
The child when sick doesn't want to be touched or talked to or looked at. Wants to be let alone. The infant is always keeping up a pitiful whining and moaning. Many times the respiration is a moaning respiration. Rattling and moaning. Always in bad humor, that is, extremely irritable when disturbed.
Any disturbance seems to increase the breathing and is an annoyance and makes the patient irritable.
No wonder the patient is wonderfully anxious, because from his appearance we would say that he must have the feeling that he is dying. He looks as if he were sinking, and if he does not get relief soon he certainly will die, for there is a filling up of the chest that is suffocating him, and the feeling is that of suffocation, dyspnoea, which is steadily increasing.
The wings of the nose move as in Lycopodium. Lycopodium competes with it very closely and resembles it very much.
There are many headaches laid down under Antimonium tart., but Antimonium crud. is more likely to work out for Antimonium headaches, while this medicine is more likely to work out for Antimonium chest troubles.
Both of these remedies have very decided gastric symptoms. Constant nausea, vomiting and indigestion. Antimonium tart. with its difficult breathing is sick at the stomach. Loathes everything, loathes food; vomits even water.
He has also a docile state and if allowed to be quiet, in spite of all the sufferings, he will fall into a sleep, or go into a state of inability to feel. He will cough and sleep, and snore through the dyspnoea, so that it is in many ways like Antimonium crud., but Antimonium crud. has nothing like the copious flow of mucus from mucous membranes that are inflamed. It has nothing like the passive state of the whole economy, It is not so desperate in its provings, and not so dreadful to look upon.
Eyes: Clinically Ant. tart. has been confined in its use mostly to the mucous membranes of the chest, but it has the same passive conditions of all the mucous membranes of the body. Discharges of white mucous from the eyes.
"Eyes prominent, glaring. Dim, and swimming, Gonorrhoeal ophthalmia."
But the rheumatic conditions furnish another form of this remedy, another phase of it like Antimonium crudum. The joints are affected, take on a passive, slow infiltration and become dropsical; dropsical swelling of all the joints. Gouty infiltration of the joints, and these are especially bad during the cold, wet weather. Eye symptoms of this gouty character.
Eyes infiltrated along with the joints, so there is a gouty state of the eyes. The gouty state affects the whole body. The mucous membrane is pale instead of being red and inflamed; it is pale and relaxed, and it appears
to ooze; mucus forms upon it very readily.
This is the state that occurs in the chest. It is not that burning rawness found in Ars. and the more acute remedies, although there is a state of prostration and the anxiety and cold sweat which resembles Ars.
Teeth: Then this gouty state affects the teeth. His teeth are all rheumatic. "Rheumatic pains in the teeth,” with rheumatic pains in the joints. Teeth are sensitive. "Teeth covered with mucus."
With all the complaints the stomach gives out, and there is nausea, inability to digest and loathing of food. Vomiting of everything taken, into the stomach; vomiting of even a spoonful of water. In most complaints this remedy is thirstless.
It is an exception that it has thirst. Generally in these attacks of dyspnoea the friends of the patient stand around with a very strong desire to do something, if it is only to hand a glass of water.
This patient is irritated by being offered a swallow of water. He is disturbed, and shows his annoyance.
The child will make an offended grunt when offered water. Thirstlessness with all these bronchial troubles, with copious discharge of mucus and great rattling in the chest.
Sometimes there is an irresistible desire for cold things in the stomach, but it is the exception.
"Desire for acids or acid fruits," and they make him sick.
Troubles brought on in the stomach from vinegar, from sour things, from sour wine, from sour fruits, as in Ant. crud.
Aversion to milk and every other kind of nourishment, but milk especially makes the patient sick, causing nausea and vomiting.
Flatulence: The stomach and abdomen are greatly distended with flatulence. The abdomen is tympanitic. With the stomach symptoms and bowel symptoms there is this constant nausea, but it is more than a nausea, it is a deadly loathing of every kind of food or nourishment, a nausea with the feeling that if he took anything into the stomach he would die; not merely aversion to food, not merely a common nausea that precedes vomiting, but a deadly loathing of food.
The weakness takes on an increased anxiety, and he increasingly suffocates when he is offered food. Kind- hearted people very often want him to take something, for perhaps he has not taken any food all day, or all night; but the thought of food only increases the dyspnoea, increases his nausea, his loathing and his suffering.
Vomiting: Vomiting is not an easy matter in this remedy. The vomiting is more or less spasmodic.
"Violent retching. Gagging and retching and straining to vomit. Suffocation, gagging, through great torture."
The stomach seems to take on a convulsive action, and it is with the greatest difficulty, after many of these great efforts, that a little comes up, and then a little more, and this is kept up.
"Vomiting of anything that has been put into the stomach, with quantities of mucus."
Thick, white, ropy mucus, sometimes with blood.
"Vomits slime, with great exertion. Vomiting large quantities of mucus. Vomits tenacious mucus." "Vomiting of slime, with bile. A tough, watery mucus, then some food, then bile."
But the principle thing vomited is the thick white, ropy mucus, flowing from the mucous membranes everywhere. Tough and stringy; can be drawn out in strings.
The patient is often choked while this thick, ropy, white mucus is expelled from the oesophagus and mouth. The mouth fills up with it. It is a tremendous effort, a spasmodic effort, for this patient to rid the stomach of its contents, which is mucus, or mucus and bile.
Early in the vomiting it is mucus, and after much straining there is a regurgitation of bile into the stomach, and the continuing of vomiting is from bile. The great straining also induces a flow of blood into the stomach, and the contents of the stomach will be streaked with blood.
Ulcerations: Ulceration of mucous membranes everywhere. It has ulcers in the nose and in the larynx, and ulcers that bleed. Bleeding ulcers in the stomach, and so there is vomiting of blood.
Like Antimonium crud., it has been useful in old drunkards.
Drunkards: Old drunkards sometimes take on a debilitated form and take frequent colds.
After getting over a big debauch, having been many days on one of their times, they become relaxed and cold, and take cold, and the chest fills up with mucus, and they are vomiting, suffocating and vomiting.
"Rattling of mucus in the chest of old drunkards."
Ant. tart. is sometimes required. Ant. crud. when the trouble is confined mostly to the stomach. Ant. tart. when the chest symptoms are present with growing anxiety and the coldness and the prostration; prostration from long drinking.
Old gouty patients, old drunkards; old broken down constitutions. In children also that have broken down constitutions, as if they had grown old. These take cold in the chest, with great rattling of mucus and
require this remedy.
Very commonly there is anxiety in the stomach, it is not always described as a pain, but an anxious feeling, a deathly sinking, an indescribable sinking in the stomach as if she was going to die.
"Anxiety in the stomach, with nausea." A passive congestion of the liver, with vomiting and bile.
Pains: The remedy is also full of cutting pains, cutting like a knife. Pinching in the intestines. Colicky pains. Distension of the abdomen.
The abdomen may be distended with serum, or it may be distended with flatus. "Sharp, cutting pains, as with knives. Most violent pains in the abdomen."
Dropsy is one of the natural conditions of all forms of Antimonium. I remember an energetic horse doctor feeding all the horses Black antimony when the epizootic was upon the land, going through all the stables.
I learned, that he was giving Black antimony to all horses and I left instructions that mine should not have any medicine except what I gave. Nearly all the horses that he treated ended in dropsy, and were laid up for days and weeks with the legs wrapped up.
It was a proving of Antimonium. Ant. tart. is full of it. It was a common thing, formerly, for old broken down constitutions to be put on Ant. Tart. at the end of pneumonia and fevers, but they almost always had bloating of the feet for three or four months after getting up.
If they did not have that, they had "fever sores."
Antimonium is a common cause of the "fever sore,” the lingering indolent ulcer that forms upon the legs following old fevers in broken down constitutions.
Sometimes they never get rid, of them. They certainly never get rid of them unless they fall into the hands of a prescriber of our school.
Apis Mellifica
Skin: This remedy has so many symptoms on the surface of the body we will study the outer aspect first. All over the body is found a thick rash, sometimes of a rose color.
It is rough and can be felt as a rough rash under the fingers. The patient at this time is greatly distressed by heat and the skin is sensitive to touch with the rash or without it. Nodular swellings here and there come and go.
Then comes an erysipelatous inflammatory condition, in patches, here and there, about the head, with great tumefaction about the face, eyes and eye-lids.
Erysipelas may occur anywhere, but it more commonly belongs to the face and runs to a high degree of inflammatory action, with stinging, burning and oedema. In the extremities we have a marked dropsy, swelling with pitting upon pressure.
A general anasarca may appear. The face is greatly swollen at times, the eyelids look like water bags, the uvula hangs down like a water bag, the abdominal walls are of great thickness and pit upon pressure, and the mucous membranes in any part look as if they would discharge water if they were punctured.
Puffing or oedema, with pitting upon pressure, is a general condition that may be present in any inflammatory state, There is a general amelioration from cold and aggravation from heat. The skin symptoms and the patient are aggravated from heat.
This prevails also in the mental state, in inflammatory conditions; in cardiac conditions, in dropsy, in sore throat, etc. Sometimes this aggravation amounts to aggravation from warm drinks, warm room, warm clothing, warmth of the fire, etc.,; if it is heat the patient is greatly disturbed.
Brain: In brain troubles, if you put an Apis patient with congestion of the brain into a warm bath he will go into convulsions, and consequently warm bathing is not always "good for fits."
It is taught in old school text-books so much that the old women and nurses know that a hot bath is good for fits, and before you get there just as like as not you will have a dead baby.
This congestion of the brain, with little twitchings and threatening convulsions, makes them put the baby in a hot bath, and it is in an awful state when you get there. If the baby needs Opium or Apis in congestion of the brain the fits become worse by bathing in hot water.
If the nurse has been doing that kind of business you have learned the remedy as soon as you enter the house, for she will say the child has been worse ever since the warm bath, has become pale as a ghost and she was afraid he was going to die.
There you have convulsions worse from heat, pointing especially to Opium and Apis. That is the way with Apis all through. It is not laid down in the books that Apis is worse in the throat symptoms from warm drinks and wants altogether cold things, and will not take warm things which aggravate, but one of our graduates wrote me that by making use simply of the generals, as he had been instructed, Apis conforming to all the rest of the case, he made a beautiful cure of a case of diphtheria which had the relief from cold, which shows how generals are continued into particulars and how they can be made use of.
The generals continue to build and enlarge our Materia Medica. Upon the outer surface then we see that Apis is full of dropsy, red rash, eruptions, urticaria, erysipelas, which inflammations extend to the mucous membranes.
The outer part of man is his skin and mucous membrane. When we are dealing with man from centre to circumference, we think of the innermost as the brain and heart and internal organs that are vital, while their coatings and coverings are external.
Apis affects the things that are external; it affects the envelopes, the coverings. You notice how frequently it affects the skin and the tissues near the skin, and it also affects the envelopes or coverings of organs; for example, the pericardium. It establishes serous inflammations with effusion. Apis produces an inflammation of the membranes of the brain. In the serous sac which encloses the heart, pericardium, and also in the peritoneum it produces the same kind of inflammation.
Thus we see that the coverings are especially affected by Apis, viz., the skin and mucous membranes and the coverings of organs; and with these we get dropsy, catarrh and erysipelas.
In all of these inflammatory conditions there is stinging and burning; burning like coals of fire at times, and stinging as if needles or small splinters were sticking in.
Mind: The mental symptoms of Apis are very striking, and the most striking thing throughout the mental state is the aggravation from heat and from a warm room,
The symptoms themselves are great sadness, constant tearfulness without any cause, weeping night and day; cannot sleep from tantalizing thoughts and worrying about everything.
Depression of spirits with constant weeping. Sadness and melancholy; extreme irritability; borrowing trouble about everything. Foolishly suspicious and jealous. Absolutely joyless. Absolutely indifferent to everything that would make her happy or joyful.
No ability to apply things that would make her happy to herself, they must mean someone else. Foolish, silly, childish behavior in a woman in confinement, in a woman in advanced years; talking foolish twaddle, such as a child would talk, on serious, occasions.
Another aspect of the mental state is the delirium, which comes on in serious forms of brain affections in children. The child gradually goes into a state of unconsciousness.
Lies in a stupor, one side of the body twitching the other side motion less, rolling head from side to side; head drawn -back rigidly; pupils contracted or dilated, eyes very red, face flushed, a stupid state or state of semi-consciousness. Child lying with the eyes partly, closed, as if benumbed.
It is suitable in congestion of the brain, meningitis or cerebro-spinal meningitis with opisthotonos when all the symptoms are aggravated from heat.
Child: The child puts on a more dreadful state if the room becomes overheated; become extremely death- like or pale if the room becomes overheated.
If the child is able to do so it kicks the covers off. If it is in a position where it can look into a large open grate it will be much aggravated. I have seen Apis children who had to be removed from near an open fire.
They will cry, to get away from the heat that comes upon them from the register or open fire. The heat increases every symptom, and sometimes causes them to break out in a cold sweat all over the body, which does not ameliorate their fever nor the burning heat.
Very often the head is rolling and tossing, the teeth gnashing, and the eyes flashing with threatening convulsions, the child carrying the hand to the head at times, a state of semi-consciousness, and the child screams out with that peculiar scream which is known to mean congestion of the brain - cri encéphalique - the brain cry.
The shriek is a very strong Apis feature. The child cries out with this shriek in sleep when going into brain troubles. It says in the text:
"Sopor interrupted by piercing shrieks."
We must be able to see in the general beginning of provings the disease which they resemble, for we do not always see the remedy in the advanced state.
We see the diseases in a state of progress, and must be able to see it in its beginning. As was the disease in the beginning so was the remedy in the beginning. Things that have similar beginnings may have similar endings.
Apis also has muttering, delirium and loquacity. All kinds of screaming and shrieking, shrill and otherwise, violent and less violent. Premonition of death, dread of death, fear of apoplexy.
"Very busy, restless, changing kind of work, with awkwardness."
Awkwardness is especially found under the fingers, toes and limbs in Apis. The whole nervous system shows a disturbance in co-ordination. This disturbance in co-ordination runs through the remedy, awkwardness, staggering with the eyes shut.
Dizziness when the eyes are shut.
"Ailments from fright, rage, vexation, jealousy or hearing bad news."
"After severe mental shock paralyzed on the whole right side."
Violence and rapidity: The complaints of Apis are attended with violence and rapidity. They come on with great rapidity, rush on with violence, until unconsciousness is reached. It has been my fortune to see many violent cases of poisoning from the sting of the honey-bee.
When the over sensitive patient is poisoned by the sting he is dreadfully sick. The majority of people in the course of their life have been stung by the honey-bee and a mere little swelling occurs in the region of the sting, a swelling as big as a robin's egg or 4 hen's egg at most, without constitutional states; that is, when the individual is not sensitive to Apis.
He may have been stung in half a dozen places, and each one gives him a little lump. But you meet one who is sensitive to the sting of the honey-bee, and if he gets one little sting on any place
in his body, he comes down with nausea and anxiety that makes him feel that he is dying, and in about ten minutes he is covered with urticaria from head to foot; he stings and burns and wants to be bathed in cold
water; he fears that he will die if something is not done to mitigate his suffering, rolls and tosses as if he would tear himself to pieces.
I have seen all these symptoms come on after Apis. The antidote for that is Carbolic acid. I have seen Carbolic acid administered in that state, and the patient described the sensation of the Carbolic acid going down his throat as a cooling comfort.
He says: "Why, doctor, I can feel that dose go to the ends of my fingers."
When you administer an antidote under such circumstances listen to what your patient says. When you get the true natural antidote, and, at times, when you get the true curative medicine in a case, no matter how high the potency is, the patient will say:
"I feel that to the roots of my hair and to the ends of my toes."
Such is the feeling it gives when the true antidotal medicine goes to the innermost portions of his economy, and that is the way we want to get our medicines always, to be guided by the symptoms of our patient that they will tell us what medicine to administer, and when the medicine is administered its highest reaction is of that sort.
Eyes: If we are well acquainted with the symptoms of Apis we can many times get along without having a specialist to treat the eyes. They make more people blind with their lotions, caustic solutions, etc., than they benefit.
The old-fashioned way was to cauterize with copper and silver nitrate solution, and the modern things are not much better. At the present day, the homoeopathic physician who is not capable of taking eye symptoms as well as lung symptoms and symptoms of any part of the body is not competent to practice medicine.
Eye cases can be prescribed for by the physician. In Homoeopathy there is no such thing as treating the eye and other organs of the body, but the patient with all his organs, not the patient with one or two organs.
Apis is a great remedy for the eyes. It has deep-seated inflammatory complaints of the eyes as a result of disease. Inflammations that are erysipelatous in character, that leave thickening of the mucous membrane and lids, and white spots over the eye; opacities.
Inflammation with opacities very extensive or in patches. Enlarged blood vessels.
Face: When the inflammatory condition is active it is attended with oedema of the lids, both upper and lower, and the whole face is sometimes in a state of oedema, such as you would expect to see after a bee sting.
The swelling of the mucous membranes of the lids is so enormous that they roll out, looking like pieces of raw beef. The fluid will run out over the cheeks in great abundance. Burning and stinging like fire, better from washing, from cold applications, worse from heat.
Chronic eye troubles that are worse from looking into an open fire, worse from radiated heat; wants something cold applied. Chronic granular lids. The results of chronic inflammation are numerous and extensive. Worse from looking at white things, worse from looking at the snow.
Pain in the eyeballs, pain deep in the eyeballs, stitches, burning, stinging and shooting. Chemosis. Apis is often suitable for old scrofulous affections of the eyes. Vascular. affections, the veins are enlarged.
"Tritis.” "Congestion to the eyes, blood-vessels injected;" whole conjunctiva inflamed.
Photophobia. Rheumatic ophthalmia, that is, a high grade of inflammation of the eyes in rheumatic subjects. Catarrhal inflammation of the eyes; scrofulous inflammation of the eyes. Hot tears gush out of the eyes; burning in the eyes.
Erysipelas of the eyes and sides of the face, extending from the right to the left. This direction is an Apis feature in many other respects.
Erysipelas commences on the right side of the face, extends over the nose to the left side.
Inflammation commences in the right side of the abdominal viscera and extends over to the left. In inflammation of the ovary the right is preferred to the left. The right side of the uterus is preferred. Pains in the whole right side of the pelvis extending over towards the left. Burning stinging here and there extending from right to left.
Inflammation of the middle ear in connection with or after scarlet fever. Throat: Now we come to the throat troubles of Apis. We have much throat trouble.
Apis cures diphtheria, especially when there is a high grade of inflammation and the membrane is scanty or comes slowly or insidiously, and it is somewhat of a surprise the gradual progress it makes; the parts are oedematous and the soft palate is puffed like a water-bag, and the uvula hangs down with a semi- transparent appearance like a bag of water.
All around the throat and mouth there is an oedematous condition looking as if it would flow water if pricked. Burning, stinging pains in the throat ameliorated by cold and aggravated by heat. Aversion to all warm substances and drinks.
The tongue swells until it fills the mouth, worse on the right half of the tongue, or involving the right side first. Raw beef appearance, denuded appearance of the tongue and buccal cavity and throat.
Various kinds of swelling in the throat; benign swellings, with burning, stinging and redness. Ulcers in the throat that come as a result of this inflammation. Apis is suitable in the severest forms of sore throat accompanying scarlet fever.
Scarlet fever: It cures scarlet fever when the symptoms agree, and it is not an uncommon thing for Apis to be suited to scarlet fever, though the rash is sometimes rough.
The scarlet fever rash is not always smooth and shiny. When the rash does not come out at all the face is very pallid, with a high grade of inflammation of the throat; the scarlet fever is in the family, and the skin is
red without any rash; in those cases that are worse from heat, want the covers off, and are sensitive to the heat of the room.
The patient desires a low temperature in the room, is worse from heat, wants cool things, worse from radiated heat especially, or hot air that comes from a register or fire.
He suffocates when a little warm air is radiating over the body. He is disturbed from heat even in the chill of an intermittent fever; if in a warm room when having a chill, he suffocates. So it is with the scarlet fever, with the sore throat, and in diphtheria; from the least whiff of radiated heat he suffocates.
He wants the doors and windows open, wants something cold. Sometimes the scarlet fever patient will go into convulsions because the rash fails to come out.
Apis is sometimes a suit able remedy and must be compared with Cuprum, Zincum and Bryonia. A warm bath will intensify the convulsion.
"Sensation of constriction and erosion in the throat in the morning." Throat sore and swollen; stinging pains. "Could not shallow solid food."
With these complaints there is often shivering, shuddering, little chills intermingled with the febrile state. Many times you will think to comfort him by covering him up with a warm blanket, but it will make him worse, he will throw it off.
A child will kick off the covert an adult who is shivering while covered up will kick off the covers. These strange and peculiar things are guiding features, things that cannot be accounted for.
Stomach and abdomen: In Apis there is vomiting, nausea, retching and vomiting, with great anxiety. Vomiting of bile and everything eaten. Vomiting of bitter and sour fluids
Apis causes soreness and tightness throughout the abdomen and hypochondria. Sensation of tightness runs through many of the complaints of Apis. The abdomen is distended with gas.
Meteoritic condition, great tension and fullness, hard and drum-like. In all inflammatory complaints, in peritonitis, inflammation of the liver, inflammation of the pelvis, there is great tension, tightness; but this tightness is not always general, sometimes it is local; sometimes it is with little congestion, but tightness prevails throughout the abdomen, and this tightness makes it impossible for the patient to cough for fear something will burst.
The cough makes him feel as if something would be torn. Cannot strain at stool. This is common in the abdominal and pelvic complaints of women. The woman will say she cannot strain at stool, because of the feeling that if she strains something will break loose.
The same state exists in the chest It seems that on coughing something will tear loose, as if the fibres are in a state of tension or stretching.
Hypersensitive state of the liver; inflammation of the liver and spleen. Pain under the short ribs, worse on the left side.
"Pains from below the ribs spreading upward. Obliged to bend forward from a painful contracted feeling in the hypochondria."
All the complaints are likely to make the patient bend forward and flex the limbs, because the state of tension is painful.
Sensitiveness of the stomach to touch. Over the whole abdomen she is so sore that touch is extremely painful; in all the inflammatory complaints of women the abdomen is very sore and painful. Soreness, distension and stinging burning pains through the abdomen. Burning beat in the stomach.
In the external abdomen there is an oedematous state. Dropsy, sometimes alone, sometimes with anasarca. Limbs swollen to the full extent, pitting upon pressure, the feet and limbs swollen, with burning, stinging and numbness in the limbs.
Feeling as if the intestines were bruised. Watery diarrhea is common in Apis; yellow stools, green stools, olive green stools, watery stools, etc.
Every day six to eight diarrheic stools, which smell like carrion. It is especially useful in a peculiar kind of stool occurring in children and infants, and intermingling of blood, mucus and food, giving the stool an appearance like tomato sauce.
The anus protrudes with stool and seems to remain open, an open anus like Phosph, and Puls. Chronic diarrhea dysentery, haemorrhage from the bowels.
In its constipation it is related more commonly to head troubles. He goes many days without a stool. The bowels seem to be perfectly paralyzed, with congestion of the brain and acute hydrocephalus.
Urines: The urinary troubles are numerous in Apis.
The urine is scanty, coming only in drops. Much straining before the urine will start, and then only a few drops; dribbling a little hot urine, burning urine, bloody urine. As soon as a few drops collect in the bladder the urging comes, constant, ineffectual urging.
Later the urine is almost suppressed. Infants go a long time without passing urine screeching and carrying the hand to the head, crying out in sleep, kicking off the covers. Very often a dose of Apis will be found useful.
It is often called for in scarlet fever when the urine is loaded with albumen. Urinary troubles, with swelling of the genitals, and the swelling is oedematous
Scanty urine in little boys, with the foreskin enormously distended, or in hydrocele. Every time the call to urinate comes he will shriek, because he remembers the pain he had the last time. Inflammatory complaints of the kidneys and ureters, bladder and urethra.
The whole urinary tract is irritated, very much like Cantharis, and these two medicines antidote each other. If you are called to a child that has been drugged with crude Apis you can generally antidote it with Cantharis. If you go to a woman who has taken Cantharis for vicious purposes, you can very often overcome it with Apis. The violent frenzy that has been brought on by Cantharis will be overcome by Apis.
The smarting, burning and stinging along the urinary tract will be found under Apis.
"Flow of urine, unconscious.” Stitching pain in the urethra with enuresis. Morbid irritability of the urinary organs. "Strangury. Agony in voiding urine. Retention of urine in nursing infants."
It is queer how the old women knew, long before Apis was proved, that when the little new-born baby did not pass its water they could find a cure by going out to the bee-hive and catching a few bees, over which they poured hot water, and of which they gave the baby a teaspoonful.
Some domestic things like that have been known among families and among nurses, and it is consistent because it is just like what we give Apis for.
"Urine scanty and foetid, containing albumen and blood corpuscles."
Especially in acute albuminuria. The acute inflammatory affection of the kidney with albuminuria, such as occurs in scarlet fever or diphtheria, or after these, such as occurs as a sequel of acute disease.
Inflammation of the kidney closes up the case and kills off a good many in allopathic hands, never in homoeopathic hands. It is closely related to the genital organs of both male and female. Swelling and oedematous state of the genitals. Apis is a great friend of the woman. It cures all of her inflammatory complaints it seems, when the symptoms agree.
That is to say, it produces inflammation of the uterus and ovaries and dreadful sufferings in the external and internal parts, and we have only to discover when the symptoms agree to cure most of these inflammatory troubles.
It even stops abortion. It will stop abortion after some miserable scoundrel has attempted to get rid of the offspring, and she has taken drugs and brought on pains, pains strong enough to expel the contents of the uterus, especially in the first, second and third months.
A little haemorrhage has come on, a mere threatening, the membranes are not yet ruptured, but they soon will be, and she has stinging, burning pains, and lies uncovered and suffers from the heat, probably from the overdose of Ergot.
Apis will overcome this greatly to her regret. This kind of villainy prevails. But women have accidents and weakness. whereby, in spite of the fact that they desire to hold their offspring, they are threatened with abortion, and Apis is a great friend to the prospective mother.
Burning and stinging pains in the ovaries, especially the right; when greatly enlarged and even cystic, Apis has proved a curative remedy, has often cured tumors, and has caused cystic formations to stop growing or to disappear.
The right ovarian region is very sensitive. Pain in the uterus and ovaries before and during menstruation. Stinging, rending, tearing pains cutting like knives, worse from heat.
It is a very easily got symptom, because in most painful symptoms heat or the hot water bag are tried with the natural hope of relief, but with this remedy it aggravates. She throws it aside, for the pain is worse from heat.
"Ovaries enlarged", etc Dropsy of right ovary. Ovarian tumor.
Apocynum Cannabinum
This remedy comes in as a good one to contrast with Apis. You will find it analogous in its symptoms and much like the complaints cured by Apis.
You will be astonished in going over the dropsical condition, the rheumatic condition, the tumefaction of the cellular tissues, the dropsy of the sacs, the scanty urine resulting in dropsy; the inflammatory swellings with oedema, at the great resemblances; and if you were to start in with two cases and work them out from their particulars, and if one feature were left out, the aggravation and the amelioration, the cold and the heat, in many cases you would not be able to distinguish between Apis and Apocynum, so near alike are their swellings, their bleedings, their distensions, and their disturbances.
Both are remedies for dropsy; routinists will try first Apis, and then they try Apocynum, and then they will try something else that is good for dropsy.
But all the way through this medicine is aggravated from cold, the patient himself is aggravated from cold. His complaints are worse from cold applications. In his distended, dropsical state, he is chilly, sensitive to air. He is sensitive to cold drinks.
He has a pain in the stomach, and even vomits, from cold drinks. Pain in the abdomen from cold drinks. Uneasiness here and there in the body when cold things are in the stomach; you see at once how different that is from Apis.
Anyone who follows symptom hunting and does not distinguish between circumstances that relate to the patient and modalities that relate to symptoms cannot appreciate these two grand distinctions, where the one patient is aggravated from heat and the other one ameliorated by heat, in all complaints.
The excretions are all diminished. The urine is scanty. The skin is dry. No matter what his complaints are, he cannot sweat. He feels if he could only perspire he would get well. There is no out throw of water. He drinks plentifully, and it goes in-to the cellular tissues to distend them, and he becomes dropsical.
He has a water constitution, one that takes in water and lets out none. He passes little water, and he perspires scantily or none at all; his skin is dry, sometimes hot, yet he is chilly.
The skin feels husky and rough, but he is chilly. Apis suffers dreadfully from dry skin, from scanty urine; yet Apis is aggravated everywhere from heat and ameliorated from cold. That is the grand distinguishing feature in the dropsies and rheumatisms and many internal complaints.
"Dropsy of serous membranes.”
Dropsy of the brain, pericardium, pleura, peritoneum; all of these are distended with serum. And there is great suffering, great uneasiness.
The inflammatory rheumatism is again like Apis, in that it takes on dropsy with it. Inflammation of the joints, of the ankles, joints, of the toes, of the fingers, inflammation of the joints all over the body.
The swelling about the joint pits upon pressure like Apis. But with the scanty urine, want of sweat, with the febrile condition, he is all the time chilly, and wants the parts well wrapped where Apis wants them uncovered. One might say,
"Why, that is only one symptom."
All who do not perceive the difference between symptoms predicated of the patient and symptoms predicated of the parts will see that as only one symptom with the rest of them. When he takes up a case and works it out in the Repertory he will use it as one symptom. Yet that feature will sometimes rule out all the rest, because it is predicated of the patient and not predicated alone of his parts.
We have many remedies where the patient himself is ameliorated from heat. He wants to be in the heat, he wants to be warm, and yet he wants cold applied to the part. But that which is the general is the ruling feature, and if we do not know and distinguish the things that are general from the things that are particular, we get our Materia Medica mixed up. We must distinguish the things that belong to the patient himself from the things that belong to his parts.
"Dropsy, with great thirst."
Dropsy: This is a great medicine for the low forms of disease, such as typhoid and scarlet fever, and is useful after lingering sicknesses. Patients become greatly prostrated, very chilly, very anaemic, have great thirst, the urine becomes scanty, the skin becomes dry.
It is a bad convalescence; he has not recovered. Dropsy sets in; dropsy after scarlet fever, dropsy after typhoid fever. A low form of disease, like typhoid fever, has kept him in bed for four or five weeks, and he is emaciated and prostrated, and now he does not gain flesh, he has no appetite, but he drinks copiously; he seems to want nothing but water.
His skin commences to distended, fills up, and becomes dropsical. That is like Apis, and Apis would be indicated provided he was always hot, and wanted to be uncovered, and wanted cold things.
Mind: The mental symptoms of this remedy have not been brought out.
We only know a few clinical symptoms, and they are of little importance. It has cured that peculiar kind of stupor belonging to hydrocephalus, but we do not know what kind of a primary case of brain disease this remedy would fit, because of lack of provings.
We only know the condition after it has existed for a long time, that is, for weeks; rolling the head and tossing about, and he is greatly emaciated. The little one has chills and fever along with it, and his skull is beginning to distend, the fontanelles are growing wider; then we begin to think of some of those remedies capable of curing dropsy in the shut sacs, and this is one of them. But we do not know the beginning. We do know the beginning of Apis, but not of this remedy.
Hahnemann's provings are full of particulars.
He cross-examined his provers as to their modalities, the time their symptoms began, and where they ended.
Many of the symptoms he felt upon himself, because he proved many remedies. Hahnemann had a sensitive constitution and deep perception, and his provings gave him an insight into medicines that he could not have obtained in any other way.
Those who prove medicines properly, conscientiously, prudently, learn more about materia Medica than anyone else.
They become inured to hardship and live longer thereform. They are hardened to their environnements, to their atmosphere, to their associates and their surroundings.
They are made better and they may be able to perceive something of what Hahnemann perceived.
But now-a-days provings are made and nothing recorded but common symptoms, that in stomachache, nausea, headache, pain in the back, cold feet. Many of our remedies are not proved much further than that.
What, when and how much, are left out. The modalities are left out, The finer sensations are not described because they are considered emotional.
"Low-spirited and bewildered. Feels as if she could do nothing but cry."
We do not know the affections of either the male or the female. We do not know the desires or aversions, mental or physical; and hence it may that this is only, a partial proving and suitable only for those complaints that show themselves upon the surface.
"Hydrocephalus, with great stupor."
That is the last stage of it where there is great prostration, loss of flesh, stiffness of all the limbs, with dropsical swellings. Many times in hydrocephalus pains shoot along the nevers and attack the joints.
Then it is that such remedies as Apis and Calc. carb. and this one take hold with wonderful depth. The first permanent and substantial indication - that the remedy is working in a hydrocephaloid case is that it
increases the flow of urine, which has been scanty all the time.
For hydrocephalus study Tuberculinum. Face: The expression of the face is that of anguish. "Face bloated, puffed, swollen. Bloating under the eyes. Pitting upon pressure. Tongue dry; great thirst."
There is another remedy that comes into this sphere that will be very often misunderstood, too, and will be likely in most instances to be given before this remedy. It is Ars.
It has all the dropsical. conditions of Apis and Apocynum. It has all the coldness and distension of the abdomen and of the shut sacs. It, too, is ameliorated in all of its symptoms, and the patient himself is ameliorated, from heat, and intense heat is required for that purpose.
He wants to be in a very hot room, but it has something else. It has a deathly prostration, a deathly anxiety and terrible restlessness, not found in either of these remedies. It has also such a cadaveric odor, discovered on entering the room, which is not common to either of these remedies.
In this way we have to take up our medicines and study them only one at a time, but we have also to study them by comparison.
The medicines that are similar in generals have to be compared as to heat and cold.
In that way we get a list of those that are ameliorated by cold and list of those that are ameliorated by heat and another nondescript list not ameliorated by either. That is the starting point, and we have to divide and sub-divide these, and so on.
"Thick, yellow mucus in the throat. Great thirst. Stiffness in the thoracis region. Fullness. A sense of distension."
You will think a moment and see that filling up the pleural cavity does not cause very much outward distension, because the ribs prevent it. They form a wall, and hence the growth or distension is towards the lungs, and downward towards the diaphragm. By this means we get increasing dyspnoea, with cough. This medicine, like Apis, must sit up; cannot lie down.
You will find it is a common-feature in hydrothorax for the patient to be compelled to sit up. because lying down increases the pressure upon the lungs and narrows the breathing space; and hence, he must sit up in order to let this heavy water-bag, the pleural sac, hang down, against the diaphragm, and that produces pressure in the abdomen and distension of the bowels.
"Thirst on waking. Thirsty all day. Great thirst but water disagrees."
He likes cold water, but it so disagrees with his stomach, causing pain in the stomach, or causing him to vomit before it even gets warm, or causing distension, or causing uneasiness, so that he dreads to take cold drinks. He is more comforted by hot drinks. Warm drinks warm him up, make him more comfortable, cold drinks aggravate. Yet his thirst is for cold.
Then come distension and vomiting. You will find patients so distended in all their cellular tissues with a general anasarca that it seems that no more water can be taken from the stomach into the blood. He is full.
The blood vessels are distended, his stomach is distended and he must vomit; and with this distension of his whole body he drinks and vomits. It is with difficulty he can eat; cannot keep it down; it will not digest. From this comes a part of these symptoms.
"Sense of pressure in the epigastrium, in the chest," so that it is almost impossible for him to get breath enough to move.
Very little food makes him feel distended. He wakes up and wants something in his stomach. There is a gnawing hunger, but every little thing, even a mouthful, makes him feel distended. His stomach is already full of water and he vomits up great quantities of water, of bile, and of undigested substances that he has swallowed.
The stomach finally, in dropsical conditions, becomes very irritable. It seems as if nothing passes through him, He finally becomes paralyzed in the bowels. The kidneys are not acting, and scarcely any urine passes. The tongue becomes inflamed. The mucous membranes are all inflamed, and probably the stomach is. Abdomen very much distended; dropsy of the abdomen.
The another phase comes on. It seems that one by one each organ ceases to perform its functions.
The ovaries and uterus fail to perform their functions, and amenorrhoea comes on with dropsical conditions. Many times this seems to be the beginning of such troubles; a failure of these organs to perform their functions, and then dropsy sets in.
A woman passes along to a low state of weakness and nervous excitement, no menstrual flow, tenderness of the abdomen, distension of the abdomen, and then distension of the limbs.
Apocynum has been a curative remedy in diarrheic conditions alternating with dropsy. Sometimes a diarrhea will set in and all the other troubles go away. The diarrhea is copious, yellow, watery and involuntary. 1 once knew large doses to be given in a case of dropsy, and it established its own peculiar diarrhea and while that diarrhea lasted the enlarged spleen and the dropsical condition of the body all went away apparently, to the doctor, in a natural manner.
It was brought to my observation, and I said, "Wait." Finally he was brought to stop, the poisoning by Apocynum, and heart failure followed at once. A similar effect is to be seen from the allopathic use of Digitalis.
The time comes when the doctor will be compelled to stop Digitalis, and the patient dies of heart failure; Digitalis is never charged with the death, and the doctor never seems to learn that Digitalis will kill.
Everywhere the functions are impaired, in the skin, the kidneys, bowels, uterus, and all tends toward the formation of dropsy.
Urinary troubles are exceedingly troublesome. Scanty urine accompanies many complaints among the early symptoms. Retention of urine; painful micturition; urging to pass urine constantly.
The bladder is sometimes only partially full, but he cannot pass urine. "Retention with great urging." "Paralysis of the extremities. Urging to urinate."
Numbness, tingling in the extremities, and finally entire loss of power. Some patients remain this way for a while, and finally dropsy will set in. It has alternating conditions, as I have mentioned; dropsies, alternating with copious discharges.
The dropsy may be relieved with copious watery discharges from the bowels or by copious spasmodic action of the kidneys, the urine being so profuse that he can hardly realize where so much water comes from. All at once it ceases.
The urine becomes scanty, and then the tissues fill with serum, and the dropsical condition progresses. These conditions cease after a while, and the heart fails.
"Urine diminishes to one-third its usual amount, without pain or uneasiness about the kidneys or bladder. Urine suppressed. No urine at all in brain affections."
It was a routine medicine once, given to all children for wetting the bed, and as it cured many it must have that symptom, but that is a clinical symptom. It is not surprising, seeing its action is so marked upon the bladder, that it has cured involuntary passage of urine.
"Dropsy of the genital organs."
I have mentioned the suppression of the menstrual flow, the amenorrhoea, but it has also a marked hemorrhagic tendency. It will establish haemorrhage anywhere, but especially from the uterus. Copious haemorrhage. The menstrual flow may become copious, too frequent, last too long; but it will also establish a uterine haemorrhage at another time. It will cause the patient to bleed so copiously that she becomes anaemic from uterine haemorrhage; and then will follow dropsy.
The old practitioners were in the habit of giving China in most instances where dropsy followed a haemorrhage. It was so generally useful, and so commonly relieved, that they seldom used any other remedy.
But Apocynum is also a remedy for dropsy following haemorrhage. Many times it will fit the symptoms clearly in dropsy following haemorrhage.
"Prolonged menorrhagia, or haemorrhage from the uterus for six weeks. Blood expelled in large clots, sometimes in a fluid state."
Moderate flow for a day or two; suddenly sets in with such violence that she cannot be out of bed. Compels her to lie quietly.
"Shreds, or pieces of membrane with the fluid blood. Menorrhagia continuing, or paroxysmal," that is, a continuous flow until the patient is exhausted.
That is like Phos. and Ipecac. and Secale. In most instances, a uterine haemorrhage will cease after about so much blood has been lost. In medicines where the flow is so liquid as it is in this medicine that tendency to cease does not come until a state of profound exhaustion has come on.
Then the dyspnoea, as has been described, will not permit the patient to lie down. This is commonly from hydrothorax. It has also a hypostatic congestion of the lungs in patients that have been sitting up a long time, so that it fills up from below, gradually creeping up so that a large portion of the breathing space is destroyed.
"Great oppression about the epigastrium. Difficult breathing. Gasping for breath. Wheezing and coughing."
It has all the rattling that is found in Tartar emetic and Tartar emetic has a similar filling up of the chest, cannot lie down.
Pulse small and irregular; almost pulseless. Disposed to faint whenever she attempts to raise her head from the pillow. Small weak pulse. Dropsy of the pericardium. Palpitation very troublesome.
Argentum Metallicum
Generalities: We will take up the study of Metallic silver.
No wonder that this remedy is a very deep acting remedy, for it has been used symbolically, and medically throughout all history.
It has been a valuable substance throughout all history. It is an anti psoric and from its symptoms. I believe it to be an anti-sycotic. It goes into the life. Especially affects the nerves, nerves sheaths. Has complaints along the nerves.
All cartilages in the body are affected by it. It produces a hypertrophy of cartilages, a thickening of the cartilaginous portions of joints, of the cartilage of the ears, and of the nose.
Produces cartilaginous growths and tumors; infiltrations. It affects the nerve substance, it is a deep organic remedy.
It is more than an ordinary remedy, for it affects all there is of man. In those nerve fibers especially that
carry messages. It affects the brain in a very profound manner, bringing about changes and a gradual softening.
Mind: A strange feature about it in its general action upon man is that is singles out mostly the intellectual faculties.
It scarcely disturbs his affections; only makes slight and vague changes in his voluntary system.
But the memory, the intellectual part of man is disturbed increasingly to imbecility. In great sufferings and it is full of suffering - it affects his ability to reason.
In nearly all the headaches and pains in the back, and the rending, tearing pains that it produces over the body, it disturbs his memory and reasoning faculties.
Disturbs his ability to think. And it comes on in persons who are in the habit of laboring with the intellectual faculties.
Business men, students, readers, and thinkers. Reasoners come to a point when they can no longer reason and the slightest mental effort brings on vertigo.
He is fatigued. All symptoms are worse after sleep. Instead of being rested for the day, he wakes in the
morning with mental fatigue and weakness, so that he can hardly move, and it is with great difficulty that he gets himself together for a mental or physical effort of another day.
Pains: If he undertakes to do any more mental work, he gets a headache. Headache mostly in the front of the head, but also in the occiput.
Another strange feature about it, it is full of rending, tearing pains along the nerves, predominantly of the lower extremities.
Tearing, as if the nerves would be torn in pieces (during rest).
Cold, damp weather, stormy weather will bring on rheumatism - not so much with swelling, although it has that, but pains apparently in the cartilages, and pains along the nerves.
And these pains are so severe that he cannot keep still. Hence, it has a rheumatic state, from cold, damp weather, from becoming chilled, in the joints and in the nerves, so that be walks and walks.
Many symptoms are better from especially walking. So tired and exhausted, but die pain is so severe that it drives him to walk. These pains are many times palliated by copious drafts of coffee, and this will suppress the sickness, and leave upon him all sorts of difficulties, under which he is threatening with break down, and in time be becomes almost useless.
"Mental weakness. Physical prostration."
Rending, tearing pains, Affections of the joints, the cartilages of the joints. Tearing pains along the bones and he is really a wreck, an old broken down constitution when he is yet young.
"A man of forty is like one of eighty." All these pains are better from motion.
Again, it full of infiltrations. Inflamed cartilages infiltrate and form into hard knots. A superabundance of cartilaginous tissue, so that round about the joints the cartilages are thickened.
In the ear and nose the cartilage is thickened. The infiltration that belongs to epithelioma. It has been a wonderful palliative in scirrhus, and in epithelioma. It has cured epithelioma.
It is on record as curing pp epithelioma of the cervix uteri.
Ulceration everywhere; but ulcers that have their beginning in the cartilaginous tissue and. break out through the cellular tissue, and copiously discharge. The ulcers infiltrate at. their base, and become hard.
Another marked feature is that it affects both testes, but it has a predominant action in the right. The left ovary and the right testis.
Such things are singular, that in one sex it should produce symptoms in one side of the body, and in the other sex on the, opposite side.
It has cured. all sorts of tumors enlargement of the ovary, and infiltrations of the tissues. It is a chilly remedy. Wants to be kept warm and its pains are ameliorate by heat.
Its headaches are ameliorated by heat - are ameliorated by pressure, by bandaging. I have orated by heat. I have many times cured these symptoms in headaches when the patient had the head wrapped up.
Now, in this medicine we class the patient as one having a lack of vital heat. He wants to be warm. Likely to be lean, growing increasingly lean, increasingly nervous, increasingly sensitive.
Takes on all sorts of whims. Women needing Silver very often do such strange and unaccountable things in (compare Argentum nitricum) their nervous states that they bar out all sympathy of their friends, and are called hysterical.
Deep seated trouble of the nerves. Growing increasingly sensitive to surroundings.
Now, the mental state of Argentum met. is just such as is aroused by confusion, just such as is I aroused by the emotions, just such as the loss of balance from fear, from anger, from fright, from disturbance of the mind.
Because this patient is so sensitive to his surroundings and so disturbed by annoyance. With his pains he becomes delirious, and it is not that involuntary delirium that we see in low forms of fever, but he becomes wild and full of rage.
He takes on mental excitement, rage and a state in which he talks nonsense with great rapidity. Sometimes there is a stage of unusual excitement in his conversation all mixed up about the character of his thought.
All of the time looks as if he were intoxicated, and he flies from one subject to an other, and prattles. Fora moment appearing to be very intense and very active in mind, and forgets all that he was talking about.
In society indisposition to talk.
Because he is incompetent. He is tired mentally and he forgets what he is talking about. Loses the thread of his discourse; and he dreads to talk because he gets complaints while talking. If compelled to answer, he becomes dizzy, and feels strange all over, and has nervous shakes or shocks.
And shocks go over him when tired like an electric shock. It comes suddenly, but the most favourable time
for that to come is just when he wants to go to sleep. He thinks, now he is away from all the troubles of the
day and can, rest, and the instant sleep comes over him he is roused from head to foot a shock, and another one, and another one, sometimes the whole night he jerks from head to foot.
His limbs jerks up, his lower limbs twitch and jerk, then he gets out of bed and walks - tries to walk it off. This comes out in the proving of Argentum nitricum, but it belongs as much to Argentum met., and Argentum met. has long cured it. In Hahnemann's study of the remedy he lays down the importance of shock on going to sleep. Shocks in the limbs.
But it is an electric shock that causes the whole body to jerk. Anxious about the health. Thinks he is certainly breaking down, for he is growing weaker. He cannot walk, though he is growing increasingly restless. He cannot exercise mentally or physically without distress. From meditation or as soon as he enters a warm room he becomes dizzy and that is an exception belonging to a few of the head troubles and the sensorium; he usually is sensitive to cold. In the house when the room is close he becomes dizzy.
It has been an astonishing feature in this remedy that precisely at the hour of no great many troubles come on, and the pains and Hess Chills. Pains in the ovary at noon. Dizziness with vertigo as if intoxicated.
The headaches are frontal and occipital. One-sided brain affection. One-sided headaches. Violent neuralgia in the head upon one side at a time, as if deep in the brain, as if involving one-half of the brain, Mostly the headaches have been on the right side-the one-sided headaches.
Those broken down patients that have become prostrated and over-wrought by exposure to the sun. Upon the scalp, the ears, here and there upon the body, itching places.
Itching and burning, like frost bite. It has an itching and burning like Agaricus, in the toes, in the ears, and he scratches the part, and scratching does not relieve it until the skin is off, until it oozes, but no relief from scratching.
Rawness in the ears, kept up by constantly boring and scratching in the ears. Scratching the skin off because of the tingling, itching and burning.
Eyes: Another strange feature is that about the eyes. Silver affects the lids more than the globe. It affects the sight, producing dimness of vision, and loss of vision; but it produces infiltration of the lids, thickening of the lids until they are almost as hard as cartilage.
The mucous membrane is infiltrated and hard, and the eyelids cannot be opened. They spasmodically close, they cannot be pulled apart except by violence. It is a blepharitis, with thickening and infiltration.
Copious discharge. Now, as we strike this as a catarrhal region, let me say that all through the remedy we will find passive catarrhal discharges. In some instances thick and yellow, but at the same time passive, a passive state of the mucous membrane. But the characteristic, the principal discharge of Argentum met. is gray, thick, tenacious mucus.
He expectorates from the lungs-and from the air passages, from the trachea and from the larynx, gray mucus. Gray mucus from the vagina, gray mucus from the urethra, gray mucus from the eyes. Only in a few instances does it have yellow discharges.
When ulceration takes place, as in the larynx and on the eyelids, we have from this ulceration thick, yellow discharges; but from the ulcerated mucous surfaces it will generally be found to be gray, except in the urethra.
It has cured old cases of chronic gonorrhoea. If we get the general character of the remedy we know what to expect when it goes to each region. If we do not know the general character of a remedy we do not know what to expect; and if we get into a region where we have the very opposite of it we know then that that is a particular, and does not conform to its generals.
But first of all we have to single out what is general, what may be expected, what belongs to the nature of the remedy, so that when we see its opposites we may recognize it and know it as an opposite, as a particular, and as an exception. Here is one of the characteristic features of Argentum itching.
"Scratching until bleeding in the ear”.
Now, this itching involves the whole outside ear and extends into the ear, so he scratches the ear until it is red, and swollen, and bleeds.
The cartilage of that ear is lumpy and nodular; is infiltrated. The cartilages of the nose are also infiltrated. Argentum met. cures many of these cases that are operated on when they have some portion of the inside of the nose removed by the surgeon, so that the patient can breathe better.
"Thickening of the bones in the nose, the thickening and building up of the mucous membrane and the cellular tissue in the nasal passages."
Argentum met. is often indicated in such cases. This remedy has a very decided action. Infiltrations go on thickening and hardening, and then we have serum in joints. This is one of the most important remedies to know in the necrosis of cartilages every where in the body.
But with it must go such nervous and mental symptoms as the remedy has, such as | have described. The patient looks sickly, pale, careworn, tired. A broken down patient. An Argentum met. patient is a sickly one who should have had a homoeopathic doctor years ago, but one who can, be patched tip and benefited now if be has not gone too far.
"Painful tension and drawing in the throat. Throat feels raw and Painful sore during expiration. This is extended into the larynx. soreness from breathing. Rawness from coughing in the larynx. Great quantities of gray mucus expectorated easily. Tension in the fauces on the right side."
Abdomen: Argentum met. has abdominal troubles. Bruised, sore feelings in the abdomen. If these progress from a catarrhal inflammation of the mucous membranes to a general congestion of all the tissues in the abdomen, diarrhea comes on, or constipation of the most inveterate character, tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands, emaciation, weakness, trembling.
Paralytic feelings here and there in the body. Painful soreness, in the whole abdomen in connection with the urinary troubles. It has a low form of tissue making, such as tuberculosis, cancerous affections, infiltrations, such as we have mentioned.
Dry stool, like sand. Undigested stool; very offensive. Catarrhal inflammation of the mucous membranes of the urinary passages, the whole urinary tract. It cures albuminuria; it cures diabetes, with sugar in the urine; and many of the broken-down conditions of the kidneys. Low, broken-down constitutions. Enormous quantities of whey-like urine. A copious flow of urine. Children lose the urine in sleep. Broken-down, nervous constitutions lose the urine in sleep.
Genitals: It has a very decided action upon the genitalia of both male and female. In the male it especially affects the testes and the mucous tract. It, infiltrates the testes, producing hardness. In the text it reads;
"crushed pain the right testicle." "Clothing increases pain on walking."
Inflammation with infiltration. Chronic orchitis. It has cured a very suspicious testicle believed to he a cancerous affection, which began in the epididymus, following a gonorrhoea. Inflammation, great hardness, pain, swelling, burning and stinging.
Another symptom here is of great importance: "Yellowish-greenish gonorrhea of an indolent character from the beginning, of eight months’ standing." That clinical symptom has been verified.
Now, it is a natural feature of gonorrhoea for the discharge to be yellow, or yellowish-green, and thick in the early stage, for it then to become lighter and lighter until it is whitish thick or thin, growing lighter in character until it becomes white and gleety. Argentum met. is the remedy when the discharge remains yellow.
The pain has all ceased, and generally when the pain ceases the discharge soon begins to be lighter, but in the Argentum met. cases pain ceases, it becomes a passive discharge, the urethra loses its sensitiveness to pain, and the mucous membrane loses its sensation to a great extent, but the thick greenish or yellowish discharge remains. Now, in these thick passive discharges that are long-standing, old cases, we are very much troubled to find remedies.
These old stubborn cases that still remain yellow, and still remain thick. They will not yield to ordinary remedies-they come under a peculiar class of remedies. Argentum met., Alumina, Alumen, Sulphur. Ones
not usually thought of in the early period, but the general constitutional state of the patient forms the character of his symptoms.
In the female we have ovarian troubles, infiltration, hardness, cystic troubles, cystic ovaries, that are cured by this remedy; ovarian tumors; very large, hard indurated ovaries-especially the left. The right testicle, the left ovary. Pain in the left ovary and back. Prolapsus, with pain in left ovary. Pain in the small of the back while sitting. The cures have been predominantly of the left ovary, although, it cures complaints of both.
Another grand feature - found in-this remedy is weakness, relaxation of muscles through the whole body; trembling; and now, if that thought is applied - if that feature of the remedy is observed in the pelvic organs - it will be seen that those muscles that hold up the uterus, the broad ligament, etc., are in a state of relaxation, they allow the uterus to sag. In other words, we get prolapsus.
Prolapsus: You will be astonished to know that homoeopathic remedies are wonderful in their ability to create tonicity, and thereby restore the prolapsed uterus to its normal position, and to remove the dragging down feeling women generally describe, a sensation as if the inner parts were being forced out.
All of these are sensations that accompany a prolapsus. Argentum is one of the medicines. In fact, the whole pelvic system is engorged increased in weight; tissues infiltrated likely to be hardened. Cervix congested and indurated. Takes on ulceration.
Greatly enlarged, congested. It has been a palliative medicine in epithelioma of the cervix, with burning, stinging pains, copious, putrid, yellowish-green and bloody discharge. It has cured a tendency to menorrhagia, copious menstrual flow; the relaxation that must be present in hemorrhages will soon be overcome when the symptoms agree, when the general state is present. Ulcer of the uterus; discharge purulent, ichorous.
"Sometimes bloody water, with unbearable stench." It is a medicine increased in weight; tissues infiltrated likely to be hardened. Cervix
"Neck of the uterus very much swollen, presented a spongy mass, deeply corroded with ulcers in different directions."
Where it was given in case of scirrhus of the uterus it says. "In less than three days foul smell was lost entirely."
When a remedy acts in that manner it actually stops the growth. In fact, a cancerous state that would go on to its termination in fourteen to sixteen months will go two or three years and the patient remain comfortable.
The remedy that is indicated stops the ulceration, it checks the destruction, and keeps the patient comfortable and with her friends for years. In cancerous affections the state of life is very low. The state of order is generally beyond restoration.
Voice and larynx: Then we come to a state of the larynx. It is a wonderful laryngeal medicine. Loss of voice with inflammation, from overuse of the voice such as occurs in singers and talkers. One who is
compelled to use the larynx much. It is then a paralytic weakness of the vocal cords. Running all through this remedy there is aggravation from any little prolonged exertion - a paralytic tendency wit aggravation from exertion.
So it is in the lungs - in every part of the body. And then comes the loss of voice. Now, apply all that we know of its ability to infiltrate.
We have tuberculosis of the larynx. Singers, public speakers, who are broken down, nervous, of poor digestion, bad inheritance, take on tuberculosis of the larynx, and the voice is lost. Ulceration follows. And this trouble finally goes into the lungs. They emaciate and get night sweats.
"Loss of voice." Generally of a painful character. Again, colds settle in the larynx. "Cannot speak a loud word; constant tickling in the larynx, provoking cough."
Rawness and soreness in upper part of larynx. Laughing aggravates the coughing-laughing will cause tickling in the larynx, and he will scrape out quantities of gray mucus.
If the irritation is in the smaller air passages, in the lungs, laughter will set him to coughing, and he will scrape out gray mucus.
"Over the bifurcation of trachea, a raw spot; when using the voice, talking, laughing, or singing." In the middle of the chest a raw sensation. "Roughness and hoarseness of the voice. Phthisis of the larynx;"
in those withered young people; a young man when he is not more than twenty five looks to be fifty. Many wrinkles as though he had had many cares.
Has a dry cough; gets up a little gray mucus. Yet he may be somewhat wiry, getting about fairly well. Has inherited phthisis. The cough is a deep cough, is aggravated from laughing, talking and in a warm room. Laughing causes cough and causes mucus in the larynx.
This remedy will turn aside this threatening phthisis, this dry teasing cough. A little dry, hacking cough especially comes under this remedy. In no instance are we likely to have those violent spasmodic shaking coughs, such as we find in Bry.
When coughing a sore feeling in the larynx.
"The cough is accompanied with an easy expectoration."
He does not usually cough so much to get up the mucus as he does to relieve a little irritation; but when there is mucus it generally comes up easily. It is not so difficult to detach as we find in many remedies.
"Easily detached mucus in the larynx."
He simply scrapes it out by an effort of the larynx. Cough and scraping of the larynx during the daytime and evening, worse in a warm room and better in the open air and from motion.
It has a sense of weakness of the chest. There are two remedies having this weakness of the chest and you cannot easily tell them apart.
Weak voice, weak chest; a feeling that it is so difficult to, breathe, and so difficult to talk, and so difficult to cough, because the muscles of the chest feel so weak.
These two medicines are Argentum met. and Stannum.
Great weakness of the muscles of the chest. The patient dwells upon it much, and it is a weakness far beyond what can be accounted for in tuberculosis, a sense of muscular weakness in the chest.
A paralytic weakness of the chest. Of course, this is wholly different from the Antimonium tart., which has a dreadful weakness of the chest, but in that remedy you will remember it is in the acute affections.
It is suitable in lingering complaints, sickness of long standing, so that "great weakness of the chest" means that which I have tried to describe and it is that witch patients will often fail in their efforts to describe.
"Doctor, I feel so weak in the chest." Now, this remedy is full of cardiac disturbances. Palpitation when lying on the back. "A sense of trembling in the chest."
A sense of quivering, fluttering, or trembling, as it will be described by the different patients, trembling in the chest.
That tremulous weakness of the whole body, bands and feet; palpitation with general trembling is strong in this remedy.
"Frequent palpitation. During pregnancy, palpitation. Palpitation at night. Palpitation associated with headaches."
With general weakness. Gradually increasing weakness. From his general weakness the knees knock together when walking. Trembling in the knees with palpitation and general weakness. The limbs become stiff,
"Numbness in the limbs, as if asleep."
Loss of power. Many of the complaints are increased during rest. Pain in the back and limbs while sitting, better while walking. All the nervous excitement that is possible in remedies comes up in this remedy.
Argentum Nitricum
Mind: We shall find by examining the symptoms of this remedy that the intellectual feature predominates, as in the metal; that the affections are disturbed only in a limited way. There is a predominance of mental symptoms.
First of all, disturbance in the memory, disturbance of reason, he becomes most irrational in his explanations of his actions.
He is irrational and does strange things and comes to strange conclusions; foolish things.
He has all sorts of imaginations, illusions, hallucinations. He is tormented in his mind by the inflowing of troublesome thoughts, and especially at night his thoughts torment him. to the extent that he is extremely anxious and this puts him in a hurry and in a fidget and he goes out and walks and walks, and the faster he walks the faster he thinks he must walk, and he walks till fatigued.
Strange notions and ideas and fears come into his mind. He has an impulse that lie is going to have a fit or that he is going to have a sickness.
A strange thought comes into his mind that if be goes past a certain corner of the street he will create a sensation, will fall down and have a fit, and to avoid that he will go around the block.
He avoids going past that corner for fear he will do something strange, He is so reduced in his mental state that he admits into the mind all sorts of impulses.
There is inflowing of strange thoughts into his mind, and when crossing a bridge or high place the thought that he might kill himself, or perhaps he might jump off, or what if he should jump off, and sometimes the
actual impulse comes to jump off the bridge into the water.
When looking out of a window the thought comes to his mind what an awful thing it would be to jump out of the window, and sometimes the impulse comes to actually jump out of the window.
There is fear of death, the over-anxious state, that death is near, and often at times like Aconite he predicts the moment he is going to die.
Looking forward to times he is anxious. When looking forward to some thing that he is about to do, or in the expectation of things, he is anxious.
When about to meet an engagement he is anxious until the time comes.
If he is about to take a railroad journey he is anxious, full of fear and anxiety and tremulous nervousness until he is on the car going and then it passes away. If he is about to meet a certain person on the street corner he is anxious and breaks out often in a sweat from anxiety until it is over with.
Not only is this particular symptom present, but the symptoms come on as a result of his anxiety.
He is excitable, angers easily, and as a result of this pain comes. When he becomes angry he becomes vehement and pain in the head comes on; cough, pain in the chest and weakness follow this anger
The anxiety he has from these circumstances will bring on complaints.
When he is going anywhere, going to a wedding or to the opera, or any unusual event it is attended with anxiety, fear and diarrhea.
So it is we have in this a wonderful medicine. It says in the text that he gave all sorts of queer reasons for his strange conduct, endeavoring to cover up, as it were, his foolishness which he himself realizes.
Sadness, melancholy and confusion. Defective memory. The sight of high houses makes him dizzy, and his vertigo is increased or comes on from closing the eyes; with the vertigo there is buzzing in the ears, great weakness and trembling.
Constitutional headaches from brain fag, from exertion of the mind. In such mental exhaustion, headaches, nervous excitement and trembling, and organic troubles of the heart and liver in business men, in students, in brain workers, in those subject to long excitement; - in actors who have kept up a long time the excitement of appearing well in public.
This state of mind progress until there is a general state of weakness; with trembling, paralysis, numbness, disturbed functions, palpitation, throbbing all over the body, with the mental state.
The nervous state continues until there is disorder of all the organs of the body. The stomach refuses to digest, everything taken, seems to go into gas, and he becomes distended and suffers with pain.
The circulation seems to be greatly disturbed in addition to the palpitation. Fullness of the blood vessels and throbbing all over the body. The blood vessels become diseased.
Atheromatous degeneration and dilatation of the veins, varicose veins.
Upon the mucous membranes and skin ulceration, and this progresses and the heart becomes increasingly feeble, and the extremities become cold and blue and the lips are cold and blue, with aggravation of all these complaints from mental excitement, from going to the opera, from meeting a friend, from keeping an engagement.
The medicine is preeminently a nervous one, full of spinal symptoms, rending, tearing pains down the extremities; such pains are found in locomotor ataxia fulgurating shooting pains.
There is one grand feature running through this patient modifying most of his symptoms, with few exceptions, and that is that he is like a Pulsatilla patient; he wants cold air, cold drinks, cold things; wants ice, ice cream; wants the head in the cold air; suffocates in a warm room.
He suffocates from warm clothing, wants the door and windows open; cannot breathe in a stuffy room, suffocates if other people are in the room; cannot go to church or to the opera, cannot go to places of amusement or gatherings, must stay at home.
He dreads a crowd, dreads certain places.
Ulcerations: Everywhere we find ulceration, but particularly upon the mucous membrane. The throat has ulcers in it, the eyelids, and of the cornea; ulceration of the bladder.
Ulcers of the uterus, of the vagina and of the external soft parts. This tendency of ulcerate seems rather strange, peculiar that it should have in its pathogenesis such a tendency, when the old school has been using it to cauterize ulcers, and yet it heals them up.
We know that Phosphorus will burn and it intensifies the tendency to ulcerate, makes the ulcer go deeper, while Argentum nitricum sets it healing.
Upon mucous membranes we find red elevations, granulations, enlargement of vessels, purplish aspect. Sensitive ulcers.
Female: The complaints in women come on before and during the menstrual period. It is a favorable time for all her complaints to be aggravated; if she have Argentum nitricum symptoms they are likely to be at their worst at this time.
She suffers from most violent dysmenorrhoea, from nervous excitement, from hysterical manifestations, and an unusually increased flow.
A tendency to hemorrhages it belongs to this remedy.
The ulcers bleed; there is bleeding from the nose, bleeding from the chest, the urine is bloody; leucorrhoea copious, menstrual flow copious; menorrhagia; bleeding from the mucous membranes generally, from the uterus. Vomiting of blood. It has cured prolonged and most inveterate ulceration of the stomach, when there has been vomiting of blood.
The aggravation at the menstrual period is a strong feature and she is free from symptoms during the interim.
The palpitation, the trembling, the coldness of the surface, though desiring cold open air, blueness of the lips, coldness of the extremities, blueness and coldness of the lower extremities to the knees and of the hands and arms to the elbows, and yet the patient wants cool things, wants something cold.
This may not be seen at any other time. Here is striking feature: "Patient cannot lie on the right -side because it brings on so much palpitations."
We have plenty of remedies with palpitation worse lying on the right side are rare (Alumen, Badiaga, Kalmia, Kali n., Lil. t., Platina, Spongia).
It is uncommon, strange, rare and peculiar.
It is such a strong feature in this remedy that to a great extent it becomes quite general, because it is a heart symptom and is intermingled with the general symptoms.
With this sensitiveness he is compelled to get into some other position; must get up and walk, because of lying on the right side.
The patient will say he throbs from head to foot while lying on the right side. Do not forget in this medicine all these general things when we come to apply them in their particulars and the particulars in the generals.
Do not forget that this medicine is one of the most flatulent medicines in the books. He is distended to bursting; gets scarcely any relief from passing flatus or eructations.
He is possessed with the distressing idea that all his undertakings must fail. When walking he becomes faint with anxiety which makes him walk faster. Everywhere you will find the intellectual symptoms predominant.
Headache: The headaches are of a congestive character; considerable throbbing, ameliorated by cold, and tight bandaging. Headache from mental exertion from excitement, with vertigo, nausea and vomiting.
Pains in the right side of the head, jagging, cutting, stitching pulsating. Head feels much enlarged.
Eyes: The eye symptoms are too numerous to mention. They are of a general character such as we find in catarrhal conditions with ulceration, relieved by cold.
All of the eye symptoms are worse in a warm room, worse from sitting by the fire. Wants cold applications, cold washing. Intense photophobia; aversion to light, and this is worse in a warm room; wants it cold, wants
it dark.
There is much swelling and tumefaction of the blood vessels of the eye, and redness, and it has a raw denuded excoriated appearance.
"Chemosis with strangulated vessels." "Cornea opaque." "Ulceration of cornea in new-born infants; profuse purulent discharge from the lids,"
and this is what the "Regulars" in former days and almost tip to date have been using for the eyes, treating them with Argentum nitricum.
Photophobia: after long looking at fine sewing, fine print. In one who has suddenly taken on far sightedness, it has come on as a congestive condition; not of old age but something that should be cured.
All at once he cannot see print at the usual distance but must hold it away off; if it occurs in some one twenty-five years of age or ina child.
At close distance it is indistinguishable. Such a disturbance of accommodation producing far sightedness it has caused and cured.
"Oedema of lids," etc.
Oedema is a word which runs through the remedy. That is to say, it has a dropsical state wherever dropsy may occur.
Face: The face is the next place we find particulars worthy of note. "Face: Sweat stood in drops on his face." "Face sunken, pale, bluish."
"Looks prematurely old."
"Face blue, heavy breathing, pulseless."
Throat: Then come the throat symptoms. Another feature of this remedy is its general tendency to produce warts.
There is a tendency to favor the growth of warts and in the throat there are little wart-like growths polypoid growths in the throat and about the genitals and anus; hence its great use in sycotic constitutions.
It has all the discharge necessary to its use in the sycotic constitution.
Felt as if he had a stick in the throat when swallowing. At once you will see its close relation to Hepar. In inflammatory conditions of the throat with ulceration.
In Argentum nitricum he wants to be ina cold room, wants cold air, and to swallow cold things. In Hepar he wants warm things to drink, warm clothing, warm room, and cannot put even his hand out of bed or his throat will begin paining him.
Things, you see, just exactly opposite, but they both have "sticks" in the throat. In dry chronic catarrh Alumina and Natrum muriaticum have "sticks" in the throat; but in red throat with tumefaction and pain these two remedies give no relief, the former two are better. "Sticks" in the throat like fish-bones.
Nitric acid, Hepar, and Argentum nitricum, are the most striking remedies for the fish-bone sensation. Many remedies have sticking in the throat, but these are the most prominent.
We know how Argentum nitricum has been used for ulceration in the throat, and here it comes in as one of the most useful remedies in congestion of the throat of long standing. Catarrhs with loss of voice. Warty
growths, condylomata, etc.
Loss of voice, tumefaction of the mucous membrane round about the vocal cords and paresis of the vocal cords. Condylomata on the vocal cords.
"Loss of appetite” and refuses drink.
Digestion: This is another feature. He feels that he must have it and it makes him sick; brings on eructations, increased flatulence, sour stomach.
He cannot digest it; it acts like a physic and brings on a diarrhea. So marked is the aggravation from sugar that the nursing infant will get a green diarrhea if the mother eats candy.
Then is it astonishing that the baby can get a dynamized dose from the mother, when the dynamized dose can travel like lightning, and sugar takes all day to be digested and dynamized and fed as poison to the baby? I remember a case that I figured and figured on.
The baby had Mercurial stools, sure enough, they were grass green. Well Chamomilla has grass green stools and Arsenicum and Mercurius and lots of remedies have grass green stools.
Routinist that I was in those days I could not get anything but Mercurius out of it, and although the baby had gotten Merc., Ars. and Cham. There was no relief, until I found that the mother had been eating candy.
When she was asked if she ate sweet things, sugar, etc., she said,
"Oh, no."
"Why, yes, you do,” said the husband;
"I bring you home a pound of candy every day.
What do you do with it?"
"Oh, that was nothing," she replied.
But the baby did not get well until it got Argentum nitricum and the mother stopped eating sugar. "Irresistible desire for sugar."
Quite a number of medicines have craving for sweets, but many of them can eat sweets with impunity. It is always a peculiar thing when one of the articles of diet, such as milk, sugar, salt, starch, etc., and the things of the table make sick.
When it is said that "I cannot eat a teaspoonful of anything with starch, egg or sugar in it without being sick," it is always strange and peculiar, because it is not something that comes in only as a craving and affecting the stomach, but it affects the whole patient.
The patient says:
"I become sick" and hence it becomes a general.
When the patient gets a diarrhea from eating sugar it is not merely a local and particular symptom, because the whole patient is sick before the diarrhea begins; the diarrhea is the outcome. Hence as it is a general it i necessary that it should be examined into.
"The vomited substances tinge the bedding black".
Incessant vomiting of food. He sometimes spits up food by the mouthful until the stomach is empty. Eructations of air accompanied by a mouthful of undigested food, like Phosphorus and Ferrum. Spitting it up; welling up in mouthfuls
"Eructations relieve ".
"Flatulence passes upwards, in quantities."
Frequent eructations. Eructations do not always relieve. It is more like China in its eructation.
The eructations of Carbo veg. relieve for some time and he feels better. This is the way with Carbo veg.; he is distended almost to bursting and he cannot get up any wind, but finally after much pain and distension it
wells up in empty eructations and then he gets relief.
With China he is distended, and every little while getting up gas, but with no relief. It does not seem to help, and sometimes patients will say they seem to get worse after it.
So it is with Argentum nitricum at times. It evidently has both.
"Most gastric ailments arc accompanied by belching." "Belching difficult; finally air rushes out with great violence." "Nausea after every meal; nausea with troublesome efforts to vomit."
I have seen these Argentum nitricum patients vomiting and purging in the same moment, not vomiting one second and purging the next, but gushing out both ways with great exhaustion like cholera morbus, so relaxed, prostrated and weak.
"Vomit; streaked brown, flocculent, like coffee grounds."
The stomach, liver and abdomen are full of pain. The abdomen distended with all this troublesome flatulence. Inflammation of the stomach, ulceration of the stomach, most troublesome diarrhea. Diarrhea with copious flatus. Stool with copious flatus in nursing children, with tormina and viscous sanguinolent stools and tenesmus.
"Diarrhea of children after weaning."
Another feature in connection with the diarrhea and dysentery is that casts are passed with the stool, like diphtheritic membrane or deposit; casts like the rectum, strings of membrane, come with the stool. Stools of green, foetid mucus with noisy flatus at night.
Urinary:
"Urine passed unconsciously and uninterruptedly." "Urging to urinate; the urine passes less easily and freely." "Bleeding of the urethra; painful erections; gonorrhoea."
It has most painful gonorrhoea with painful erections in the male. In the female the vagina is extremely sore, and the external soft parts are swollen; tumefaction.
Vagina feels sore on urinating; bloody discharge. In the male, orchitis from suppressed discharge. In the female, ovaritis, inflammation of all the pelvic organs. Great soreness all over the pelvis.
Bleeding from the vagina. Ulceration of the uterus. Coition is painful or impossible.
"Pains like sticks or slivers in and about the womb".
This sensation prevails wherever there are ulcers.
"Prolapsus with ulceration of the os or cervix".
Haemorrhage of short duration; shoot ing pains through abdomen and stomach. Metrorrhagia. Complaints
of nervous women and at the menstrual period. Menses suppressed or scanty. Complaints during pregnancy.
Heart: Under the symptoms of the heart and pulse: "Anxiety with palpitation and throbbing through the whole body."
"Violent palpitation from the slightest mental emotion or sudden muscular exertion. Palpitation obliges her to press hand hard against heart for relief. Heart’s action irregular, intermittent," etc.
Pain in the lumbar region comes on while sitting, but is better when standing a walking. Pain in the back from flatulence. Sore pain in the spine. Pain in back at night. Great weight in the lumbar region. It is a very useful remedy in locomotor ataxia.
Great restlessness. The nervous symptoms are very numerous. Periodical trembling of the body. Chorea, with tearing in the legs. Convulsions preceded by great restlessness. Nervous faintish, tremulous sensation, etc.
The sleep symptoms are quite general. Distressing nightmares. The dreams are horrible Wakens in excitement and with starting. All sorts of strange, horrible things in sleep. Dreams of vicious and violent things, and that everything is going to happen to him. Dreams of departed friends, etc.
On waking in the morning limbs feel bruised aching in the chest, Cannot sleep at night because he is so nervous.
Erysipelatous bed sores. While riding, palpitation and anxiety compelling him to get out of the wagon and walk, and that real fast.
Purplish rash, such as appears in the most serious forms of scarlet and zymotic diseases.
Its most natural antidote is Natrum muriaticum. When you have the ulceration where the throat has been cauterized or the cervix uteri or eyelids have been cauterized by Nitrate of Silver, study Natrum mur. and see if the symptoms of the case would not justify its administration. It is the most common natural antidote for these vicious practices.
Arnica Montana
Mind: The Amica patient is morose, wants to be let alone, does not want to be talked to, does not want to be approached. He does not want to be approached, both because he does not wish to enter into conversation, a mental state, and also because he does not wish to be touched on account of the great bodily soreness.
These are the two most striking things in this medicine. Irritable, morose, sad, fearful, easily frightened, imagines all sorts of things, especially that he has heart disease, or that he will mortify, or that some deep- seated trouble is upon him. Full of nightmare, dreadful dreams, dreams of muddy water, robbers, etc.
Horrors in the night. He frequently rouses up in the night, grasps at the heart, has the appearance of great horror, fears some dreadful thing will happen. A sudden fear of death comes on at this time, rousing him up in the night; he grasps at the heart, and thinks he is going to die suddenly. He is full of dreadful anguish,
but finally he comes to himself, lies down and goes off into a sleep of terror, jumps up again with the fear of sudden death and says:
"Send for a doctor at once."
This is repeated night after night in persons Who are fairly well in the daytime, who have no sympathy because there seems to be no reality in their sickness, only a mental state. It is also seen in persons who have gone through a railroad accident, or through some shock, who are sore and bruised from injury.
They rouse up in the night with a fear of sudden death, with an expression of terror; the horrors they really went through are repeated. This is similar to Opium, only the Opium fear remains, even in the day time. Arnica dreams of it.
When sick in bed afflicted with a zymotic disease, with violent fever, or with fever after an accident or injury, he becomes greatly prostrated, stupid and unconscious. He can be aroused and will answer a question correctly, but goes into a stupor, or be hesitates about a word and is unable to find correct words when trying to answer and goes back into the coma.
When roused up, he looks at the doctor and says: "I do not want you; I did not send for you; I am not sick; I don't need a doctor."
He will say this even when he is seriously ill. | have seen an Arnica patient lie back upon his pillow after emptying the stomach of a black fluid like blood, seriously ill, with the face mottled, in zymotic sickness or such as threaten malignant chill, that one would think he was almost going to die, look up and say:
"Iam not sick; I did not send for you; go home."
Yet when in a state of health he was friendly, kind-hearted, knew me well, glad to shake hands with me; but now he is irritated at seeing me there and insists there is nothing the matter with him. Such is the "shock" state, almost a delirium. After finishing such a sentence he will lie down in a stupor, will lie in bed drawn up in a heap and merely groan when spoken to.
He wants to be left alone, does not want to be bothered, does not want to be talked to. That state ushers in complaints after a shock that has shaken the whole system, that has disturbed the circulation.
When a symptomatic typhoid is coming on, i.e., when an intermittent or remittent is taking on symptoms that are typhoid in character, when the tongue becomes shiny, and sordes appear about the teeth and lips, when there is sinking, and soreness all over the body, there are times when this mental state that I am describing will appear and the patient must have Arnica.
Arnica will interrupt the progress and prevent a typhoid state. Arnica is sometimes suitable to the scarlet fever, when the eruption does not come out, in those severe forms when the body is dusky, mottled and covered with red spots; the patient is constantly turning and that mental state is coming on with moroseness, and stupidity. It is a wonderful remedy, a misunderstood remedy, a misused remedy, because it is almost limited to bruises.
It is one, of sheet anchors in certain seasons, in the malarial valleys of the West, for intermittent fever In congestive chills, in those dreadful attacks with prostration, stupor, mottled skin, with congestion that comes on suddenly, with anxiety.
The doctors know these fevers, they dread them, and can only cope with them by using such remedies as Arnica and Lachesis and other deep-acting medicines. It is not true that these patients must have Quinine.
For many years I practiced among these cases, and | have seen numerous congestive chills and had no need for Quinine. I would rather have my repertory and a few potencies than all the Quinine in the drug -stores.
The sugar pills cure safely, permanently and gently, while the Quinine never cures, but suppresses, and there is nothing in the after history of that patient drugged with Quinine and Arsenic but congestion and violence so long as he lives.
"Horror of instant death, with cardiac distress in night."
From that it spreads on throughout the system, but hat horror of instant death is a striking feature and it comes on regardless of heart disease.
A horror in the night when there is nothing to come upon the patient; a horrible congestion, which affects especially the cerebellum and upper part of the spinal cord.
"Stupor with involuntary discharges." "Coma, insensibility." "Lies as if dead."
There symptoms come in the low forms of disease, in the typhoid type of disease. Many of the remittent fevers, if badly treated, or permitted to run their course under bad nursing, will turn into a continued fever.
While the true idiopathic typhoid comes on after many weeks of gradual decline, a symptomatic typhoid may come on suddenly, and it has symptoms of graver form than ordinary typhoid. The idiopathic typhoid will seldom kill and will generally run to a favourable termination, if the doctor stays at home.
This remedy is full of delirium in these low types of fever, even delirium like delirium tremens. "Hopelessness; indifference."
"Hypochondriacal anxiety, peevishness."
"Fears being struck by those coming towards him."
That is both bodily and mental.
Physical state: Now, with this mental state thoroughly in mind, we are prepared to take up the general physical state, which has in all complaints, all over the body a feeling as if bruised. It is not strange that Arnica is used for bruises, but it is very foolish to put it on the outside and to rub it on in the form of the tincture.
It produces in its pathogenesis mottled spots, like bruises. If you take Arnica internally, in large doses, you will have mottled spots, bluish spots, which become yellowish, due to ecchymoses, from extravasations of the smaller capillaries.
This is, to a certain extent, what takes place in bruising. It is an extravasation of blood from the capillaries, and sometimes from the larger vessels.
But all over the body he is sore and bruised, as if he had been beaten. If you watch an Arnica patient in order to get the external manifestations of his state, you will see him turning and moving.
You will at once ask yourself, Why is he restless? and if you compare remedies in your mind, you will say, He is like Rhus tox.; he stays in a place a little while and then he moves.
No matter if he is only semi-conscious; you will see him make a little turn, part way over, and then a little further over, and so on until he is over on the other side.
Then he commences again, and he will shift a little and a little, and so he turns from side to side. The question is, why does he move so, why is he restless?
It is an important matter to solve. We notice the awful anxiety of the Arsenicum patient that keeps him moving all the time.
We notice the painful uneasiness felt all over the body with the Rhus patient so that he cannot keep still.
The Arnica patient is so sore that he can lie on one part only a little while, and then he must get off that part or to the other side. So if we ask him,
"Why do you move so?" he will tell us that the bed feels hard. That is one way of telling that the body is sore.
A more intelligent individual will say it is because he is so sore and feels as if bruised and beaten, and he wants to get into a new place.
Soreness: This state of soreness is present if it be a symptomatic typhoid, an intermittent fever, a remittent fever, or after an injury when he is really bruised all over. You get the same continual uneasiness and motion, moving every minute. He moves and thinks that now he will be comfortable, but he is comfortable only for a second.
The soreness increases the longer he lies, and becomes so great that he is forced to move. With Rhus tox. the longer he lies the more restless he grows and the more he aches, until he feels as if he will fly if he does not move.
With Rhus tox. the uneasiness passes off after moving, and with Arnica the soreness passes off if he gets into a new place. With Arsenicum you see him moving about and look wild, and he is anxious, and this anxiety forces him to move, and he gets no rest, for he keeps going. The Rhus tox. and Arnica patients get better from every little motion.
The Arnica patient bleeds easily; his blood vessels seem to be relaxed, and extravasation is easy. Blue spots come easily upon the skin, and internally the mucous membranes bleed easily.
The parts that are inflamed bleed. He is subject to catarrhal conditions, and if he has a cough he bleeds easily. The mucus that is hawked out of the chest and throat is streaked with blood, or dotted with tiny pin-
head blood clots. His urine contains blood and there is bleeding from the various orifices of the body. There is not sufficient tone in the fibres of the vessel to hold the blood within the vessel walls and they ooze.
All over the body there is a lameness, and soreness, and a feeling as if bruised; a rheumatic lameness; the joints are swollen, sore and lame. If an acute disease becomes more severe, we shall find the mental symptoms as described, and there will be an increasing soreness in the muscles. Arnica is very suitable for that sore, bruised condition of the body, therefore Arnica is a very important remedy in injuries, bruises and shocks, injuries of joints, injury of the back with lameness and soreness.
In such conditions Arnica becomes one of the first remedies, and unless there are general decided symptoms calling for other remedies it should be the first remedy. Arnica will very often take all the soreness out of a sprained ankle and permit him in a few days to go walking about, to the surprise of everybody.
The black and blue appearance of sprained joints will go away in a surprisingly short time, the soreness will disappear, and he will be able to manipulate that joint with surprising ease. I have seen a sprained ankle when it was black and blue, so swollen that the shoe could not be put on, but after a dose of Arnica, the swelling disappeared in an astonishing way, the discoloration faded out and the patient was able to stand on the foot.
No such result can be obtained with the use of Arnica lotion externally. A high potency of Arnica is most satisfactory in bruises, and when no decided contra-indication is present Arnica is the first remedy; but for the weakness of tendons that follows such a condition Arnica is not always sufficient, and the Rhus tox. is its natural follower.
If the weakness and tenderness remain in the joints, follow the Rhus with Calcarea. One will not, of course, give these remedies all on the same day, and not in the same glass, but will wait until all the good has been gotten out of the Arnica before following with Rhus.
It is quite a common thing for aching and restlessness and weakness to come into a part that has been injured, and Rhus is then a suitable remedy; and it is quite common for a joint that has been badly treated to remain sore and weak, and then Calcarea comes in as a natural follower of the Rhus tox. and then we have to resort to Causticum,
Staphysagria, and other remedies, because of some peculiar feature in the case, but these remedies are all related more or less to Arnica, Rhus and Calcarea. For another class of injuries compare Ledum and Hypericum.
Arnica is useful in some chronic cases; especially in old cases of gout. It is quite a common thing for old cases of gout to rouse up into a new soreness of joints, with great sensitiveness.
You will see the old grandfather sit off in a corner of the room, and if he sees little Johnnie running towards him, he will say:
"Oh, do keep away, keep away."
Give him a dose of Arnica and he will let Johnnie run all over him. He does not want to be touched or approached; he feels that anything that is coming towards him is going to hurt him. He is extremely sensitive, his joints are sore and tender, and he is afraid they will be hurt.
This medicine has erysipelatous inflammation. If you have an erysipelas of the face with the mental state described, with soreness, and sort bruised feeling all-over the body, you need not wait longer before prescribing Arnica.
The sore, bruised feeling all over the body, and the mental state, would decide in favor of Arnica against any medicine.
In inflammation of the kidneys and bladder, of the liver, and even in pneumonia, the mental state and the sore, bruised feeling all over the body would enable you to do astonishing work in such cases, even though Arnica has never produced pneumonia.
It has all there is of the rusty expectoration, with all the soreness of the chest and catarrhal state, the coughing and gagging, and sore, bruised feeling all over the body, and then add to this the condition of stupor and the mental state that belongs to the inflammatory condition of any organ and is especially strong in this medicine. We do not have to worry about any particular fineness of diagnosis to settle upon Arnica.
Arnica has aversion to meat, broth and milk. There is great thirst at particular times, for instance, during the chill of intermittent fever he has thirst, while at other times he is thirstless.
"Vomiting of dark-red coagula, mouth bitter; general soreness." Vomiting of black, inky substances.
Arnica is a useful remedy in inflammatory conditions of the abdomen, liver, intestines, with tumefaction tympanites, prostration, tendency to uneasiness, and so sore that he cannot be touched. This state also comes with typhoid.
Do not forget the symptoms of Arnica in appendicitis. You do not need to run for the surgeon for every case of appendicitis if you know Bryonia, Rhus tox., Belladonna, Arnica and similar remedies. The homoeopathic remedy will cure these cases, and, if you know it, you need never run after the surgeon in appendicitis except in recurrent attacks.
If you do not know your remedies, you will succumb to the prevailing notion that it is necessary to open the abdomen and remove the appendix. It is only deplorable ignorance that causes appendicitis to be
surrendered to the knife.
Offensiveness is a feature of Arnica; there is offensiveness of the eructations, and the flatus. The stool is horribly offensive.
"Nightly diarrhea."
"Stool involuntary during sleep."
"Stools of undigested food, purulent; bloody slimy, mucus: Dark blood, very foetid stool.
Here we see the tendency to oozing from the mucous membranes. Black watery stools with black vomit. "Retention of urine from exertion,"
from overwork, from injury, from concussion of the brain, from some violent accident. The urine is brown, or inky, dark.
"Piercing pains as from knives plunged into the kidneys."
"Urine very acid, with increase of specific gravity."
Pregnancy: Another feature of Arnica occurs in pregnant women. The extreme sensitiveness, soreness or tenderness throughout the whole body is especially felt in the abdominal viscera, in the uterus and pelvic region.
Sensitiveness to the motion of the foetus sore and bruised; the motions of the foetus are very painful and keep her awake all night. Arnica will remove that soreness and she will not distinguish the motion of the foetus It is not an increased motion of the foetus, but that she is sensitive to it.
"Constant dribbling of urine after labor."
A general feature also of the remedy is that the body is cold and the head hot; the whole body and the extremities are cold, but the head feels hot.
This is a marked condition in sudden congestive attacks, in congestive chill and congestive intermittent fevers. This, sometimes, is the very beginning of a severe attack when there has been almost no warning except a night or two of bad dreams and distress, fearfulness and stupefaction, with soreness in the body. If he comes out, of this, an increased soreness in the body comes on, which grows worse and worse until he is sore and bruised all over.
Children: Children going into severe attacks of infantile fever may threaten convulsions, the head is hot and the body cold. Most physicians will think of Belladonna, which has such cold extremities and such a hot head. Do not forget Arnica, especially in those children who seem to have an aversion to being touched, and scream out every time the mother takes bold of the leg or arm.
Look into the history a little and you will see that this is a soreness, and if you strip the child you may observe dusky spots, which give an added indication of Arnica.
This is a whooping-cough remedy; you can easily conjure up what the indications are for whooping-cough; aggravation from touch, sore, bruised condition, spasmodic cough with expectoration of blood, or dark blood-streaked mucus, or little tiny pin-head dots all through the mucus. Vomiting of food with black mucus. The mental state of the child can easily be imagined.
The child is cross and fretful.
"Cough excited by cries in children when accompanied by anger and tossing about." "Paroxysms of cough at night."
"Whooping cough; child cries before paroxysms as though in fear of soreness."
You can easily apply that which we have seen in the remedy to the various diseases that come on. Stitching pains in whooping cough, pleuritic pains with catarrh of the chest, with pneumonia or pleurisy, inflammatory conditions.
It has also more lingering complaints, "fatty degeneration of the heart."
Stitches in the cardiac region, stitches from left to right. "Weary, bruised, sore, great weakness, must lie down, yet bed feels too hard."
It will be well to read over all these symptoms; there are numerous particulars in the remedy, many little symptoms that are of great interest.
It follows well after Aconite and is complementary to Aconite, Ipeca and Veratrum.
Arsenicum Album
Generalities: From the time of Hahnemann to the present day Arsenicum has been one of the most frequently indicated medicines, and one of the most extensively used. In the Old School it is most extensively abused, in the form of Fowler's solution.
Arsenic affects every part of man; it seems to exaggerate or depress almost all his faculties, to excite or disturb all his functions. When all our medicines have been as well proved we will effect wonderful cures. It is a substance easily proved because of its active nature, and from its very abuse we have learned much of its general nature.
While Arsenic impresses the whole economy and disturbs all the functions and tissues of man, there are certain prevailing and striking features in it.
Striking features: Anxiety, restlessness, prostration, burning and cadaveric odors are prominent characteristics.
The surface of the body is pale, cold, clammy, and sweating, and the aspect is cadaveric. In chronic sickness with great debility, anaemia, from long exposure to malarial influence, in the poorly fed and from syphilis this remedy is of great service.
The anxiety that is found in Ars. is intermingled with fear, with impulses, with suicidal inclinations, with sudden freaks and with mania.
It has delusions and various kinds of insanity; in the more active form, delirium and excitement. Sadness prevails to a great extreme. So sad that he is weary of life; he loathes life, and wants to die, and the Arsenic patient does commit suicide. It is a remedy full of suicidal tendencies.
The anxiety takes form also in the restlessness, in which he constantly moves. If he is able to get up lie goes from chair to. chair; the child goes front nurse to mother, and from one person to another. When in bed, unable to sit up, the patient tosses and turns from side to side; if he is able, he climbs out of bed and sits in the chair, keeps moving from one place to another, and when thoroughly exhausted, he gets back into bed again.
The restlessness seems to be mostly in the mind; it is an anxious restlessness, or an anguish, with the idea that anguish is a deathly anxiety. That is an effort to express it in the extreme. It seems that he cannot live, and it is not pain that drives him to anguish, but it is an anxiety intermingled with restlessness and sadness.
This state prevails in all diseases intermingled with prostration. An uneasiness comes in the early stage of disease, and lasts but until the prostration becomes marked. While lying in bed, at first he moves his whole body, moves himself in bed and out of bed; but the prostration becomes so marked that he is able to move only his limbs until at last he becomes so weak that he is no longer able to move and he lies in perfect quiet in extreme prostration.
It seems that prostration takes the place of anxiety and restlessness, and he appears like a cadaver. So remember that these states of anxiety and restlessness go towards the cadaveric aspect, towards death. This is seen, for instance, in the typhoid, where Arsenicum is indicated. At first there is that anxious restlessness with fear, but the increasing weakness tends towards prostration.
Running all through the remedy there is the burning mentioned as one of its most marked generals. There is burning in the brain, which makes him want to wash his head in cold water. This sensation of heat in the inner head with pulsation is ameliorated by the cold bathing, but when there is a rheumatic state that affects the scalp and outward nerves, and there is burning, the burning then is ameliorated by heat.
When the headache is of a congestive character, with the sensation of heat and burning inside the head, and there is a feeling as if the head, would burst, and the face is flushed and hot, that headache is better from cold applications and in the cool open air.
So marked is this that I have seen the patient sitting in the room with clothing piled on to keep the body warm and with the window open to relieve the congestion of the head.
Therefore, we say a striking feature belonging to this medicine is relief of all the complaints of the body from wrapping up and from warmth in general, and relief of the complaints of the head by cold, except the external complaints of the head, which are better from heat and from wrapping up. The neuralgias of the face and eyes, and above the eyes, are better from heat.
The burning is felt in the stomach; there is burning in the bladder, in the vagina, in the lungs. It feels as if coals of fire were in the, lungs at times, when gangrenous inflammation is threatened, and in certain stages of pneumonia.
There is burning in the throat and burning in all the mucous membranes. The skin burns with itching, and
he scratches until the skin is raw, and then it burns, but the itching ceases; as soon as the smarting lets up a trifle the itching commences again. All night the itching and burning alternate, burning for a minute, when be scratches it until it is raw, but soon the itching begins again and it seems that he has no rest.
The secretions and excretions of Arsenic are acrid; they excoriate the parts, causing burning. The discharge from the nose and eyes causes redness around the parts, and this is true of all the fluids from the various orifices.
In ulcers there is burning, and the thin, bloody fluid discharged excoriates the parts round about. The odor of the discharge is putrid. If you have ever discovered the odor of gangrene, of mortified flesh, you know the odor of the Arsenicum discharges.
The stool is putrid, like decomposed flesh, putrid blood. The discharges from the uterus, the menstrual flow, the leucorrhoea, the faeces, the urine, the expectoration, all the discharges are putrid. The ulcer is so putrid that it smells like decomposing flesh.
Arsenic produces a tendency to bleeding. The patient bleeds easily and may bleed from any place. There is vomiting of blood; bleeding from the lungs and throat. Bloody discharge from the mucous membrane, at
times, when inflammation is running high; haemorrhage from the bowels, kidneys, bladder and uterus; anywhere that mucous membrane exists, there may be haemorrhage. Haemorrhage of black blood and discharges that are offensive.
Gangrene and sudden inflammatory conditions like gangrenous and erysipelatous inflammations are common in Arsenic. Parts suddenly take on erysipelas, or parts that are injured suddenly take on gangrene.
Gangrene in internal organs, malignant inflammations, erysipelatous inflammation. No matter how you look upon the condition, no matter what it is called, if it is a sudden inflammation that tends to produce malignancy in the part it belongs to Arsenicum. Inflammation will go on in the bowels for a few days attended with a horribly offensive discharge, vomiting of clots of blood, great burning in the bowels with tympanitic condition.
You may almost look upon this as a gangrenous inflammation, so violent, sudden and malignant is it, and it has the anxiety, prostration, fear of death, and chilliness, the patient wanting to be covered warmly.
When with this inflammation of the bowels the patient is relieved by heat, it means Arsenic.
You should remember that Secale has a similar state; it has all the tympanitic condition, all the ulceration and prostration, all the offensive odor and expulsion of offensive clots, and all the burning, but the Secale patient wants to be uncovered, wants things cold, wants the windows open.
The only distinguishing feature between these two remedies in a case may be that Secale wants cold and Arsenicum wants heat, but this is the way we individualize in our homoeopathic prescribing.
When there is gangrenous inflammation in the lungs, we find the patient has been taken with a chill, there has been restlessness, prostration, anxiety and fear; as we enter the room we detect a horrible odor, and on looking into the pan we see the patient has been spitting up by the mouthful, black, foul expectoration.
Look and see if the patient wants to be covered warmly; if he is easily chilled, and heat feels good; then it is a hard thing to cover that case outside of Arsenicum. The prostration, the vomiting, the anxiety, the restlessness the cadaveric aspect are present, and where will you find a remedy with that totality outside of Arsenic.
I have many times gone a long distance to detect, from the very aspect of things, these symptoms that could be gotten while walking from the door to the bedside. Every symptom is Arsenic; he looks like in acts like it and smells like it. You may go to a patient with high grade inflammation of the bladder, with frequent urging to urinate, straining to urinate, and there is bloody urine intermingled with clots.
It has been found by the attending physician when he introduces the catheter to draw off the urine that clots dam up the catheter, a little is drawn off and then it stops. We have a history of restlessness, anxiety, fear of death, amelioration from heat, great prostration.
You must give Arsenic, not because there is inflammation of the bladder, but because it is a rapidly progressing inflammation, and because it is gangrenous in character. The whole bladder will be involved in a short time, but Arsenic will stop that.
So it is with all the internal organs, the liver, lungs, etc.; any of them may take on violent and rapid inflammation. We are not now speaking of the particulars, but only illustrating the general state of Arsenic, in order to bring out what runs through the whole nature of it.
We shall find when we take up the remedy and go through it in a more particular way these features will stand out everywhere.
Mind: The mental symptoms show in the beginning anxious restlessness, and from this a continuation towards delirium and even insanity with all that it involves; disturbance of the intellect and will.
"He thinks he must die."
I went to the bedside of a typhoid patient once with all the general aspect I have described; he was able to talk, and he looked up at me and said:
"There is no use of your coming, I am going to die; you might as well go home; my whole insides are mortifying.”
His friend was seated on one side of the bed, giving him a few drops of water, and just about as often as he could get there with it he wanted it again.
That was all he wanted; his mouth was black, parched and dry. He got Arsenic. One of the characteristic features of Arsenic is thirst for small quantities often, just enough to wet the mouth. It is commonly used as a distinguishing feature between Bryonia and Arsenic for the purpose of memorizing the Bryonia has thirst for large quantities far apart, but Arsenicum little and often, or violent unquenchable thirst.
"Thoughts of death and of the incurability of his complaints." "Thoughts crowd upon him; he is too weak to keep them off or to hold on to one idea."
That is, he lies in bed tormented day and night by depressing ideas and distressing thoughts. This is one form of his anxiety; when tormented with thoughts, he is anxious. In the delirium he sees all kinds of vermin on his bed.
"Picks the bedclothes."
"Delirium during sleep, unconscious mania." "Whimpering and gnashing teeth."
"Loud moaning, groaning and weeping." "Lamentations, despair of life."
"Screaming with pains."
"Fear drives him out of bed, he hides in a closet."
These are instances of insanity that take on first a state of anxiety, restlessness, and fear. Religious insanity, with the delusion that she has sinned away her day of grace, the biblical promise of salvation do not apply to her, there is no hope for her, she is doomed to punishment.
She has been thinking on religious matters until she is insane. Finally she enters into a more complete insane state, a state of tranquility; silent, and with aversion to talk. So we see one stage enters into another;
we have to take the whole case together; we have to note the course that the case has run in order to see it clearly and note that in one stage there were certain symptoms and, in another stage, other symptoms.
For instance, we know that in the acute conditions of Arsenicum there is either thirst for ice cold water, and for only enough to moisten the mouth, or there is thirst for water in large quantities and yet it does not quench the thirst; but this thirsty stage goes on to another in which there is aversion to water, and hence we see that in chronic diseases.
Arsenicum is thirstless. So it is in a case of mania; in the chronic state he is tranquil, but in the earlier stages, in order to be an Arsenicum case, he must have gone through the Arsenicum restlessness, anxiety and fear.
Fear is a strong element in the mental state, fear to be alone; fears something is going to injure him when he is alone; full of horror; he dreads solitude and wants company, because in company he can talk and put off the fear; but as this insanity increases he fails to appreciate company and the fear comes in spite of it. He has a violent increase of his fear and horror in the dark and many complaints come on in the evening as darkness is coming on.
Many of the mental troubles, as well as the physical troubles, come on and are increased at certain times. While some complaints, pains and aches are worse in the morning, most of the sufferings of Arsenicum are worse from 1-2 P.M. and from 1-2 A.M. After midnight, very soon after midnight sometimes, his sufferings begin, and from 1-2 o'clock they are intensified. Extreme anxiety in the evening in bed.
"Averse to meeting acquaintances, because he imagines he has formerly offended them."
Great mental depression, great sadness, melancholy, despair, despair of recovery. He has dread of death when alone, or on going to bed with anxiety and restlessness. He thinks he is going to die and wants somebody with him.
The attacks of anxiety at night drive him out of bed. This is an anxiety that affects the heart, and so the mental anxiety and cardiac anxiety almost seem to coincide. A sudden anxious fear comes over him at night; he jumps out of bed with fear that he is going to die, or that he is going to suffocate.
It is full of dyspnoea, cardiac dyspnoea, and varying forms of asthma. The spells come on in the evening in bed or after midnight; from 1-2 o'clock he is attacked with mental anxiety, dyspnoea, fear of death, coldness, and is covered with, cold sweat.
"Anxiety like one who has committed murder."
This is one form of his anxiety; he finally works up to the idea that the officers are coming after him, and watches to see if they are coming in to arrest him. Some unusual evil is going to happen to him; always looking for something terrible to happen.
"Irritable, discouraged, restless." "Restlessness, cannot rest anywhere." "As a consequence of fright, inclination to, commit suicide."
The Arsenicum patient with this mental state is always freezing, hovers around the fire, cannot get clothing enough to keep warm, a great sufferer from the cold.
Chronic Arsenicum invalids cannot get warm; they are always chilly, pale and waxy, and in such invalids, after they have bad several unusual weak spells, dropsical conditions come on.
Arsenicum is full of puffiness and dropsy; oedematous condition of the extremities; dropsy of the shut sacs or of the cavities; swelling about the eyes; swelling of the face, so that it pits upon pressure. Arsenicum in these swellings is especially related to the lower eyelid rather than the upper, while in Kali carb. the swelling is more in the upper eyelid than the lower, between the lid and the brow.
There are times when Kali carb. looks very similar to Arsenic, and little features like that will be distinguishing points. If they run together in generals, then we must observe their particular peculiarities.
Periodicity: In the headaches we have a striking general feature of Arsenicum, brought out in their periodicity. Running all through this remedy there is periodicity, and for this reason it has been extensively useful in malarial affections which have, as a characteristic of their nature, periodicity.
The periodical complaints of Arsenic come on every other day, or every fourth day, or every seven days, or every two weeks. The headaches come on these cycles, every other, or third, or fourth, seventh or fourteenth day.
The more chronic the complaint is, the longer is its cycle, so that we will find the more acute and sharp troubles in which Arsenic is suitable will have every other day aggravations and every fourth day aggravations: but, as the trouble becomes chronic and deep-seated, it takes on the seventh day aggravation, and in the psoric manifestations of a long, lingering and deep-seated kind there is a fourteenth day aggravation.
This appearing in cycles is common to a good many remedies, but is especially marked in China and Arsenic. These two remedies are similar to each other in many respects, and they are quite similar in their general nature to the manifestations that often occur in malaria. It is true, however, that Arsenic is more frequently indicated than China. In every epidemic of malarial fever that I have gone through I have found Arsenicum symptoms more common than those of China.
These headaches bring out the interesting point that we mentioned above. Arsenicum has in its nature an alternation of states, and this carries with it certain generals. Arsenicum in all of its bodily complaints is a cold remedy; the patient sits over the fire and shivers, wants plenty of clothing, and wants to be in a warm room.
So long as the complaints are in the body this is so; but when the complaints are in the head, while he wants the body warm he wants the head washed in cold water, or wants the cold air upon it.
The complaints of the head must conform to the generals that apply to the head, and the complaints of the body must be associated with the generals that apply to the body. It is a difficult thing to say which one of these two circumstances is most general, and it is sometimes difficult to say which one is the general of the patient himself, because he confuses you by saying:
"Iam worse in the cold," but when his headache is on he says: "I am better in the cold, I want to be in the cold."
It is really only the head, and you have to single these out and study them by the parts affected. When things are so striking you must examine into it to see what it is that brings about modality.
You will see a similar state running through Phosphorus; the complaints of the stomach and head are better from cold, i. e., he wants cold applications upon the head with head sufferings, and wants cold things in the stomach with stomach complaints, but in all the complaints of the body be is ameliorated from heat.
If he steps out into the cool air, he will commence to cough, if he have a chest trouble. So we see that the modalities that belong to the part affected must always be taken into account. For instance, you have a patient suffering from neuralgia or rheumatic affections and these same pains, extend, to the head, then he wants the head wrapped up because they are ameliorated from heat.
But when it comes to cases of congestive conditions of the head, he then is better with his head very cold. Now, as I have said, there is an alternation of these states in Arsenicum.
I will illustrate by mentioning a case.
Once a patient had been dragging along with periodical sick headaches. The sick headaches were better from cold water, cold applications to the head, could hardly get them cold enough, and the colder the better. These headaches came every two weeks, and so long as they were present he desired cold to the head.
Then these periodical headaches would be better, for long periods; but when they were away he was suffering from rheumatism of the joints, which was also periodical, and also more or less tenacious, and when this rheumatism of the joints and extremities, with more or less swelling and oedema, was present he could not get warm enough; he was at the fire and wrapped up; he was relieved by heat, and wanted warm air and a warm room.
This would last for a period and then subside, and back would come his sick headaches and last for a while. That is what I meant by the alternation of states. Arsenicum cured that man, and he never had any of them afterwards.
The alternation of states sometimes means that there are two diseases in the body, and sometimes the remedy covers the whole feature in alternation of states.
I remember another case, which will illustrate this peculiar nature of alternation of complaints, which is shared by other remedies besides Arsenic.
A patient suffered from a pressure in the top of the head, such as I recently described to you under Alumen. She would suffer for weeks from that pressure on the top of the head, and the only relief she could get was from hard pressure; she tired herself out with hard pressure and would contrive all kinds of weights to put
upon the head.
That would go away in the night and she would wake up the next morning with constant urging to urinate. The irritable bladder alternated with pain on top of the head.
Alumen cured. In many of these anti-psoric remedies we have an alternation of states. This illustrates the necessity for getting the symptoms of all the states that present themselves for cure,
otherwise you will many times prescribe in a chronic case of psoric character and temporarily relieve it, when back comes another aspect of it.
You have only hastened the disease a little faster than it would go if let alone. But that is not homoeopathic prescribing. Be sure, when a remedy presents one state, that it is a clearly indicated in the other state, otherwise that remedy is not the similimum.
You must hunt until you find the remedy that has both states, or you will be disappointed. We sometimes do not discover this alternation of states until we have brought it back two or three times by incorrect prescribing.
Some people are so reticent and so difficult to get symptoms from that we do not always get these symptoms.
But you examine your record and you find where - you have made a foolish prescription, that you drove a new condition away and back came the first trouble, and you kept on with this see-saw business.
Now remember in doing this your patient is not improving, and that you must re-study the whole case, taking the alternating states into, account. In Arsenic, the head symptoms alternate with physical symptoms.
You will find running through certain remedies, as a part of their nature, that mental symptoms alternate with physical symptoms; when the physical symptoms are present, then mental symptoms are not trates the necessity for getting the symptoms of all the states that is determined it is a good point, but sometimes you do not find a remedy, because many of our remedies are not well recorded; they have not yet been observed in their alternations and marked as such.
We find in Podophyllum the peculiar feature that the headaches alternate with diarrhea; he is subject to sick headaches and to diarrhea, and one or other will be present.
In Arnica the mental symptoms alternate with uterine symptoms. The uterine symptoms, when ob served, look like Arnica, but these go away in the night and mental symptoms come on, the mind being heavy, gloomy and cloudy.
When you have remedies that have these manifestations it requires a greater depth of vision to see the alternation of states, because these things are not always brought out in the proving, for the reason that one prover had one group of symptoms, and another.
Yet a remedy that is capable of bringing out the two groups of symptoms is sufficient to cure this alternation of states. The periodical headaches of Arsenic are found in all parts of the head.
They are the congestive headaches with throbbing and burning, with anxiety and restlessness; hot head and relief from cold, There are headaches in the forehead, which are throbbing, worse from light, intensified from motion, often attended with great restlessness, forcing him to move, with great anxiety.
Most of the headaches are attended with nausea and vomiting. The sick headaches are of the worst sort, especially those that come every two weeks. In some of these old, broken-down constitutions you will find he is cold, pallid, sickly; he is always chilly and freezing except when the headache is on, and it is better from cold; the face much wrinkled, great anxiety and no desire for water.
Remember that it was said in the acute state of Arsenic there is thirst, thirst for little and often, dry mouth and desire for water enough to moisten the lips, but in the chronic states of Arsenic he is generally thirstless.
Headaches: There are headaches on one side of the head involving the scalp, one-half of the head, worse from motion, better from cold washing, better from walking in the cold air, though very often the jar or stepping starts up a feeling as of a wave of pain, shaking, vibration or looseness in the brain; such are the sensations and these are conditions of pulsation.
Then there are dreadful occipital headaches, so severe that the patient feels stunned or dazed. They come on after midnight, from excitement, from exertion; they come on from becoming heated in walking, which produces determination of blood to the head. Nat. mur. is a medicine. analogous to this in its periodicity and in many of its complaints. It has congestive headaches from walking and becoming heated; especially from walking in the sun.
The Arsenicum headaches are generally worse from light and noise, better from lying down in a dark room, lying with the head on two pillows. Many of the headaches commence in the afternoon from I to 3 o'clock, after the noon meal, grow worse into the afternoon, lasting all night.
They are often attended with great pallor, nausea, prostration, deathly weakness The pain is paroxysmal; violent head pain during the chill of an intermittent fever; headache as if the skull would burst during an intermittent fever. Arsenicum has this head pain of a congestive character in intermittent fever, as if the
head would burst.
A peculiar feature of the thirst is that there is no thirst during the chill except for hot drinks; during the heat there is thirst little and often for water enough to moisten the mouth, which is almost no thirst, and during the sweat there is thirst for large drinks.
Thirst begins with the beginning of the heat and increases as the dryness of the mouth; he desires only to moisten the mouth until he breaks out in a sweat, and then the thirst becomes a desire for large quantities very often, and the more he sweats the more desire he has for water.
The headache is during the chill; it increases, so that it becomes a congestive, throbbing headache during the chill and heat; this grows better towards the end of the heat as the sweat breaks out, it is ameliorated by the sweat.
In chronic headaches, congestive headaches and malarial complaints, a tendency to shrivel is observed upon the skin; a prematurely old, wrinkled appearance of the skin comes on. The mucous membrane of the lips and mouth often shrivels and becomes wrinkled.
This is also found in the diphtheritic membrane of the throat as a peculiar feature of Arsenic, and belongs, as far as I know, to no other remedy. The exudation in the throat is leathery looking and shriveled.
A shriveled membrane is not a sure indication for Arsenic, but when Arsenic is indicated you would be likely to find this kind of membrane; such cases as are very malignant in character, very offensive, putrid, those with a gangrenous odor.
At times the head is in constant motion when there are complaints in the body, because parts of the body are too sore to be moved; then the motion of the head comes on because of restlessness and uneasiness, and he keeps it in motion even though it does not ameliorate.
The face and head are subject to oedema; dropsy of the scalp and erysipelatous inflammation of the face and head.
The scalp pits upon pressure and there is a little crepitation under it from pressure. The scalp is subject to eruptions and is very sensitive. So sensitive is the scalp that the hair cannot be combed; it seems as if the touch of the comb or brush when rubbing over the scalp went into the brain.
Sensitiveness is a feature of Arsenic; sensitiveness to smell and touch; over sensitiveness of all the senses. A peculiar feature that perhaps I have not brought out is the over sensitiveness to the circumstances and surroundings of the room.
The Arsenicum patient is an extremely fastidious patient. Hering once described him as "the gold headed cane patient.” If this is carried out in a woman who is sick in bed she is in great distress if every picture on the wall does not hang perfectly straight.
Those who are sensitive to disorder and confusion and the disturbed and made worse until everything is placed in order have a morbid fastidiousness which has its similimum in Arsenic.
Eyes: The eye symptoms of this remedy are very prominent. In old cases of suppressed malaria, in broken down constitutions, in pallid, sickly people who are subject to general catarrhal conditions, and such catarrhal conditions as localize more especially in the nose and eyes, the eye symptoms will be troublesome.
There are discharges from the eyes. It may be a conjunctivitis, in a general way involving the lids and the globe, going on sometimes to ulceration with thin, bloody discharge, increasing to thick, acrid discharge that excoriates the eye, making the canthi red and causing granulation with burning.
The burning is better from washing in cool water and also better from dry heat. Very often ulcers appear on the globe of the eye, often upon the cornea.
It has various kinds of hypertrophy beginning in patches that will form scars, and in old ulcerated patches little growth similar to a pterygium growing towards the centre of the eye and threatening blindness.
The inflammations are sometimes attended with swelling, burning and excoriating discharge; this swelling is bag-like in character, and so we find "baggy" lids and little bags forming under the eyes.
The face is waxy and pale, presenting the appearance of a broken down constitution or a dropsical condition.
The catarrhal state involves throat and nose, and it is sometimes difficult to separate the nose symptoms, from the throat symptoms.
The Arsenicum patient is always taking cold in the nose, always sneezing from every change in the weather. He is always chilly and suffers from drafts, and is worse in cold, damp weather; always freezing, chilled through.
These pale, waxy, broken down constitutions with catarrhal discharges from the nose on looking at a bright light become blind.
Sneezing and coryza with inflammatory conditions through the whole nasal cavity, throat, larynx and chest.
The cold begins in the nose and goes down into the throat, very often causing hoarseness with dry, tickling, hard, rasping cough.
It is a difficult matter to find remedies for a coryza that begins in the nose and extends into the chest with bronchial troubles; very often you require a change of remedy, as the chest symptoms often run to a different remedy. It is difficult to find a remedy that covers the symptoms of both nose and chest.
Arsenicum is the remedy for old, chronic catarrhal troubles of die nose where the nose bleeds easily, and he is always sneezing and taking cold, always chilly and pallid, tired, restless, full of anxiety in the night and has troublesome dreams.
The mucous membrane is easily inflamed, producing patches of red and ulcers that bleed easily. Great crusts form in the back of the nose.
There is a striking tendency too ulcerate in Arsenicum. If it is a sore throat it ulcerates; if colds settle in the eyes, they may end in ulceration; catarrhal troubles in the nose end in ulceration; and this ulceration tendency, no matter where the troubles locates, is a very strong feature of Arsenicum.
It is the remedy for catarrhal complaints of the nose and other places in broken down constitutions from syphilis or malaria, or a constitution that has gone through blood poisoning of some kind, either poisoning from a dissecting wound, or from erysipelas or typhoid fever or other zymotic states improperly treated, or poisoning with quinine and like substances that break down the blood and establish a state of anaemia. If an ulcer comes upon the leg, if a leucorrhea comes on, if any discharge is established the patient is relieved thereby.
Now let some of these discharges slack up and you have a chronic state apparently from retained secretions, but it is a form of blood poisoning. So it is with suppressed ear discharges, suppressed throat discharges, suppressed leucorrhea and ulcerations.
Arsenicum is one of the medicines that will conform to the anaemic state that follows each suppression. At the present day it is fashionable to use the cautery, to make local applications to stop leucorrhoea and other discharges and to heal up ulcers.
Now, when these external troubles go there is an anaemic state established in the economy, the patient becomes waxy and pallid, sickly looking, and these catarrhal discharges come on as a means of relief because of the suppression of some other condition.
For instance, since the suppression of a leucorrhoea the woman has had thick, bloody or watery discharge from the nose. It is frequently suitable to the constitution when an ulcer has been dried up by salves, or an old car discharge has been stopped by the outward application of powders. The doctor thinks he has done a clever thing in stopping such discharges, but he has only succeeded in damming up the secretions which are really a relief to the patient.
Such medicines as Sulphur, Calcarea and Arsenicum are suitable for the catarrhal discharges that come from these suppressions, in broken down constitutions.
Arsenic is also like unto the condition that has been brought about from the absorption of animal poisons. It goes to the very root of the evil, as it is similar to the symptoms brought on from a dissecting wound. Arsenic and Lachesis are medicines that will go to the cause at once and antidote the poison, establishing harmony and turning things into order.
The nose symptoms, then, of Arsenic are very troublesome and furnish and extensive part of the symptom image of an Arsenicum patient. They always take cold easily, are always sensitive to cold and the catarrh is always roused up on the slightest provocation.
When an Arsenicum patient is at his best he has discharge more or less of a thick character, but when he takes a little cold it becomes thin; the thick discharge that is necessary to his comfort slacks up, and then he gets headache and on comes thirst, restlessness, anxiety and distress.
This goes on to a catarrhal fever of two or three days duration, and then the thick discharge starts up again and he feels better; all his pains and aches disappear. It has been of great service in epithelioma of nose and lips.
Inflammation of the throat and tonsils with burning, increased by cold and better by warm drinks. There is redness and a shriveled condition of the mucous membrane.
When there is blood poisoning going on, as in diphtheria, and exudate appears upon the mucous membrane and it becomes gray and shriveled, ashy colored, and this sometimes covers the whole of the soft palate and the arches. It looks withered. He is prostrated, anxious, sinking, weak, not a great deal of fever, but much dryness of the mouth.
The catarrhal state goes down into the larynx with hoarseness, and into the trachea with burning, worse from coughing, and then comes constriction of the chest, asthmatic dyspnoea and dry, hacking cough with no expectoration.
This testing cough is attended with anxiety, prostration, restlessness, exhaustion and sweat, and the cough does not seem to do any good.
The cough is the early part of it and keeps on as a dry, rasping, harsh cough for several days without doing any good; and then asthmatic symptoms come on, when be expectorates great. quantities of thin, watery sputum.
There is constriction about the chest a great sense of tightness and wheezing, and he feels he will suffocate. Bloody mucus is expectorated at times, but the symptoms are more generally of a catarrhal character.
Symptoms of pneumonia sometimes appear with the rusty expectoration. The expectoration is excoriating. There is in the chest a sense of burning, as if coals of fire were in the chest, and it goes on to bleeding and liver-colored expectoration.
Arsenicum is a bleeding medicine, one that predisposes to haemorrhage, and bleeding takes place from all mucous membranes; commonly of bright red blood, but in this region the parts take on a gangrenous state and the hemorrhages become black and there are little clots like portions of liver.
The same are found in the vomited matter and in the stools. The expectoration is horribly offensive, so much so that you soon get the idea that there is a state of gangrene.
The patient is at this time going into a state that perhaps cannot be any better described than a gangrenous inflammation; there will be signs to indicate the inflammatory condition, and there will be the smell of the expectoration which you will detect as soon as you open the door,
The expectoration is a thin, watery fluid intermingled with clots. In the pan you will find this watery expectoration looking like prune juice, and in the midst of it will be clots of blood; the offensiveness is horrible. He has gone through the period of restlessness and is now prostrated, sinking, pallid, and likely enough covered with a cold sweat.
Stomach and bowels: When we come to the stomach we find everything that may be called a gastritis, vomiting of everything taken, even a teaspoonful of water, extreme irritation of the stomach, great prostration, horrible anxiety; dry mouth; a very little hot water will sometimes comfort him for a minute, but soon it must come up; cold fluids are vomited immediately. The whole oesophagus is in a state of inflammation; everything burns that comes up or goes down. Vomiting of bile and blood.
Extreme sensitiveness of the stomach is present; he does not want to be touched. Heat applied externally relieves, and there is a temporary relief from warm drinks; the heat is grateful. In the bowels we have much trouble; this remedy has all the symptoms of peritonitis; distension of the abdomen, a tympanitic state; cannot be handled or touched, yet he will keep moving because he is so restless, he cannot keep still, but finally he becomes so weak that exhaustion takes the place of restlessness.
Dysentery is likely to come on, with involuntary passages of urine and faeces, one or both, with haemorrhage from the bowels and bloody urine.
As the bowels move, we get the cadaveric odor to the stool, a smell like putrid flesh. The stool is bloody, watery, brown like prune juice, or black and horribly offensive.
Sometimes dysenteric in character with dreadful straining and burning of the anus; every stool burns as though there were coals of fire in the rectum; burning it! the bowels, burning all the way through. The pain in the abdomen is better from the application of hot things. The tympanitic condition is extreme.
Sometimes there is a gastro-enteritis that takes on a gangrenous character that in olden times used to be talked about as gangrene of the bowel, a mortification that always ended in death.
A thick, bloody discharge is passed with a horrible odor, all substances are vomited, the patient desires to be in a very warm room, wants to be well covered, wants hot applications and warm drinks, looks cadaveric and smells cadaveric, with a dry, pungent odor that penetrates everything, but if he wants the covers off, wants a cool room and windows open, wants to be sponged with cold water, and wants ice cold drinks then he must have Secale.
Bowels: I want to warn you against the too promiscuous use of Arsenic in the summer complaints of young babies, for dysentery and cholera infantum. It has so many little symptoms that are so common to these complaints. that if you do not look out and are not warned you will be likely to give your patient Arsenic, suppress some of the symptoms, changing the aspect of the case so that you cannot find a remedy for it and yet not cure the case with Arsenic.
There is a strong tendency to be routine and give Arsenic without a sufficient number of generals being present; ie., if you give it on particulars and not on the generals of the case.
This medicine is full of diarrhea and dysenteric symptoms; in these conditions there will be the pallor, the anxiety, the cadaveric aspect and the cadaveric odors.
In the dysentery there is most distressing and frequent urging to stool, scanty, slimy, black, fluid, inky stools with cadaveric smell, great prostration, restlessness and pallor. In the bowel troubles, in low forms of disease, the stool becomes involuntary.
This is a condition of the rectum, a relaxation of the rectum, great prostration. Involuntary stool generally indicates either local or general exhaustion, and in this remedy there is terrible exhaustion, so that there is involuntary diarrhea in typhoid and in low forms of zymotic disease; involuntary urine.
Purging is sometimes present in Arsenic, but generally be does not have much purging, such as we find in Podophyllum, Phos. ac. Usually there will be little, frequent gushes, little spurts with flatus and the great exhaustion that occurs in cholera, little spurts with mucus, slimy, whitish stools.
Arsenic is not so commonly indicated in cholera, i. e., during the gushing period, but sometimes after the gushing is over and the vomiting and purging have passed, leaving a state of extreme exhaustion, we have a state that appears like coma, the patient looks almost as if dead, except that he breathes. We find, then, that Arsenicum will establish reaction.
Cholera infantum with great prostration, sinking and cadaveric appearance, great coldness, covered with told sweat, cold extremities, cold as death; cadaveric, sickly, foul, pungent, penetrating odor in the room from the faeces and urine and even of what is vomited.
The passages from the bowels are acrid, excoriating, causing redness and burning. Very often the burning extends into the bowels.
The rectum and anus burn, smarting all about the anus. It has tenesmus, painful, unbearable urging, great distress in the lower bowel, in rectum and anus, terrible state of anxiety of the patient and the pain is so violent and the suffering so intense, the anguish so intense, that he can think of nothing but death the fearfulness and frightful feelings are such as he has never experience in his life, and he feels confident these mean he is going to die.
This, like all other complaints, is attended with restlessness, and when not at stool he is walking the floor, going from bed to chair and from chair to bed. He will get on the stool and then back to bed, then he is hurried to stool again, sometimes he loses it.
Sometimes there is a chronic hoemorrhoidal state with burning, and the hemorrhoids protrude when at stool, he is much exhausted after getting back into bed after a stool, with these protruding lumps which are like grapes and feel like coals of fire. They are hot, dry and bleeding. Fissures of the rectum that bleed at every stool, with burning Itching and eczematous eruptions about the anus with burning.
This kind of pain may be felt anywhere in the body; burning is characteristic of Arsenic, stitching is characteristic of Arsenic. Now, put these together and the patient often describes it as being stuck with red hot needless all over him. This red hot sensation, which is a common feature all over, is felt at the anus, and especially when there are hemorrhoids, burning and sticking like hot needles in the hemorrhoids
At times when a patent is coming down with the early stage of a violent attack he will have all the rigor and chill that it is possible to find in the Materia Medica and that can be found in disease. Rigors and chills of violent character, and at such times he describes a feeling as if the blood flowing through the vessels were ice water. He feels a rushing through the body of ice cold waves.
When the fever comes on, he is intensely hot from head to foot, before the sweat has appeared, he feels that boiling water is going through the blood vessels. Then comes on the sweat and dyspnoea and all complaints in which he is prostrated and becomes cold.
While the sweat some times relieves the fever and pains, yet it is prolonged and attended with great exhaustion and does not relieve his exhaustion.
Many of his complaints are increased with the sweat; for instance, thirst is increased, the drinking is copious and does not relieve, it seems he cannot get enough and patients will say:
"I can drink the well dry,” or "Give me a bucket of water."
Such things are indicative of the state of thirst. During the fever he wants little and often; during the chill he wants hot drinks.
Arsenicum is a very useful medicine in the eruptions of the genitals with burning.
In little ulcers that burn, even when they are syphilitic; herpetic vesicles that appear upon the foreskin and upon the labia; chancre or cancroids with burning, smarting and stinging, but especially in those that are weak, that offer no willingness to heal, but that do the very opposite, that spread, those that we call phagedenic, those that eat from their outer margins, become larger and larger.
Ulcerations: Arsenic and Merc corr. are the two principal medicines for spreading ulcerations such as eat in every direction, very offensive. Such ulcerations as follow the opening of a bubo in the inguinal region where there is no tendency to heal.
A little, watery, offensive discharge keeps coming and extending, ulceration keeps spreading round about the opening, no tendency to heal.
Or the patient has been in the hands of a surgeon who has passed his knife down the threatening suppurating bubo and it has been followed by red, angry, erysipelatous appearance and shows no tendency to heal.
The edges have been removed by ulceration, and now the surface has cleared off, leaving a surface the size of a dollar; sometimes becoming serpiginous. These ulcers are sensitive to touch and burn like fire.
Genitals: In the male and female sexual organs there are many symptoms of importance. In the male organs a dropsical condition, dropsy of the penis, oedematous appearance, so that the penis is enormously swollen and looks like a water bag; the scrotum, especially the skin of the scrotum, greatly swollen and humid round about, the parts.
In the female the labia are enormously swollen with burning, stinging pains, hard and swollen. Erysipelatous inflammation of these organs, ulcerations, of a syphilitic character; these when such symptoms burning, smarting and stinging are present.
In the female, violent, burning pains in the genitals with or without swelling, burning that extends up into the vagina, with great dryness and itching of the vagina.
The leucorrhoeal discharge excoriates the parts, causing itching and burning with great suffering. Whitish, watery, thin discharges that excoriate; so copious sometimes that it will run down the thighs.
The Arsenicum menstrual flow is very often excoriating in character. Copious leucorrhoeal flow intermixed with menstrual flow, very profuse and very acrid.
Suppressed menstruation going on for months; amenorrhoea in prostrated, nervous patients, wrinkled, careworn, haggard facet.
Of course, Arsenic has a wonderful reputation in the old school for anaemia, and it is said to be as good as Ferrum for anaemia.
Ferrum and Arsenic are the strong drugs for anaemia, so that it is not to be wondered at that these pallid mortals find benefit from Arsenic.
"During menstruation, stitches in the rectum." "Leucorrhoea acrid, corroding, thick and yellow," etc.
After parturition the woman does not pass the urine; no urine in the bladder; suppression, or the bladder is full and it does not pass.
In connection with this subject you will find Causticum the most frequently indicated remedy when you go back and the woman has not passed the urine and it is time that she should; you will frequently find it indicated when you have no other symptoms to go on. Aconite will be more frequently indicated than any other remedy if the infant has not passed the urine.
This is keynote practice and is to be condemned when there are other symptoms to indicate a remedy.
If there are no other symptoms study Aconite and Causticum and see if there is any reason why they should not be given.
Cancer: Another feature in connection with the woman, Arsenic is a wonderful palliative in cancerous affections, such as occur in the uterus and mammary glands.
Burning, stinging pains have entirely disappeared, in incurable cases, of course. It becomes one of the palliatives.
Larynx and chest: Arsenic has loss of voice, laryngitis, with dry teasing cough; a cough that does not seem to do any good; hacking constantly, dry, hacking cough.
Study its relation to asthma and difficult breathing, dyspnoea. Arsenic has cured some long standing cases of asthma of a nervous character; asthma that comes on after midnight, in patients who suffer from the cold, those who are very pallid, dry wheezing cough, must sit up in bed and hold the chest, anxious restlessness with prostration.
The heart symptoms are troublesome to manage when they get to be like Arsenic; the symptoms correspond to a state of great weakness, great palpitation, palpitation from the least exertion or excitement, great anxiety, anguish, weakness; he cannot walk, he cannot go upstairs, he can hardly move without increasing the palpitation; every excitement brings on palpitation.
"Severe paroxysms of palpitation or attacks of syncope during endocarditis."
Arsenicum corresponds to most serious complaints of the heart, corresponds to many of the incurable complaints of the heart; i. e., when you see Arsenic corresponding in all of the symptoms with these marked cardiac affections, dropsy of the pericardium, etc., you have a class of cases that are very serious,
"Angina pectoris," etc.
"Rheumatism affecting the heart," etc. "Hydropericardium with great irritability," etc. "Pulse frequent, small, trembling."
"Pulsation through whole body," etc., etc.
Again this goes on to another state when the heart becomes weak, pulse thread-like, patient pale and cold, covered with sweat, pulse very feeble. When this is not a state of the heart itself then Arsenic becomes a wonderful remedy; that is, it is capable of cure.
Fever: I want to say a few things concerning a few essentials, some few things most general to the Arsenicum type of intermittent.
You can read the general state of intermittent fever and fevers generally and apply what has been said.
Arsenic has all the violence of the chill that you can find in any remedy, with excitement, headache, prostration, dry mouth, desire for hot drinks and to be covered up warmly, with all the anxious restlessness and prostration that you can find in any medicine; but the time of the Arsenic case is an important thing.
A striking feature of the Arsenic time of chill is its irregularity, coming not twice alike, coming at any time. It has afternoon chill and after midnight chill, sometimes in the morning, sometimes at 3 or 4 P.M., sometimes at 1 P.M.
It has a striking periodicity in its nature. Hence it has an intermittent nature. It has a striking feature of thirst.
During the chill, while there is sometimes great thirst, he has aversion to cold things, hence can take only hot drinks, hot teas, etc.
During the fever the thirst increases because he has dry mouth, and he drinks little and often, just a teaspoonful to wet his dry mouth.
Water does not quench his thirst, for he wants but a tablespoonful, little and often. This runs on into the sweat with prostration, increased coldness, desire for copious drinks, unquenchable thirst for cold drinks.
The chill is attended with great aching in the bones, likely to commence in the extremities, and during the chill there is a great head congestion with purple fingers and toes.
Put these things together and the prostration that occurs with the awful anxiety, and you can most always in a general way pick out the Arsenic case.
But it has so many details in its chill, fever and sweat that if you take the details of symptoms and leave these general features out you will be likely to be able to cover almost any case of chills, i.e, you may think you will, but unless some of these general nates are present that stamp it as Arsenic you will fail.
It is one thing to stamp the whole case as Arsenic and another thing to say that these are Arsenicum symptoms.
So it is with China and Quinine; they have numerous particular symptoms, and yet to make the case a China or Quinine case the striking general features must be present.

Arum Triphyllum
Generalities: Many boys have wandered in the low grounds where this wild turnip grows, and have taken a nip out of it, and probably remember the sensations in the mouth that they received at that time.
I distinctly remember making an endeavor to enjoy a piece of wild turnip. The tingling that is left in the lips and tongue and from the throat to the end of the nose, and wherever sentient nerves come to the surface, is astonishing.
The prickling and tingling is painful. It is a sensation that cannot be let alone. It requires a continued manipulation, and from this we gather the sensations that must be present in children when they are suffering from acute diseases and this remedy is indicated.
For, in spite of the rawness and bleeding and smarting of the parts, they will insist on pinching and scratching and picking the lips and pressing around the mouth and boring into the nose.
It has been a guiding feature in acute diseases, scarlet fever, many throat affections, diseases that take on a low type, such as continued fever and eruptive fevers.
Among other complaints, sore throats, zymotic affections, delirium and excitement, even maniacal manifestations. It is manifested to a great extent in these associated symptoms. It must be that there is in the nose and lips painful tingling that the patient persists in boring the fingers into the nose.
Manipulating and pinching the lips, picking the lips. It is altogether a different symptom that occurs in delirium of a low, muttering type, which we call carphologia, picking the bed clothes, picking all the time,
picking and handling the clothing, a busy, low form of muttering, must be doing something all the time groping around with the fingers and feeling for something.
This is the carphologia and it is a mental symptom. While "picking the lips" is given under the "mental" symptoms in the repertory, it is not intended to mean that it is a mental symptom like carphologia.
Now, you will find two expressions in the repertory, and it is necessary to have two - the one is that "the nose itches,” and the other is "he rubs the nose,"
he does something; that is what an individual would do if his nose itched. One's mind is not always directed towards the two-one is a direct and the other is an indirect expression.
This remedy has not been sufficiently proved to bring out the nature of its chronic manifestations. It has undoubtedly something of that kind, but it has been used in a limited way among acute affections of a zymotic character. It has not been used to any great extent for chronic sick headaches, but it has cured some headaches that are worse in the heat, worse in a warm room and from warm clothing, worse from becoming warm, worse from wrapping up the body.
Heat in the head, determination of blood to the head. It has also cured eruptions upon the scalp like eczema.
Nose: It has also been found useful in catarrhal affections of the nose, eyes and lids. About the nose its affections have been mostly of the acute kind. It has most dreadful coryza,
The nose is stopped up, and more stopped up on the left side. Must breathe through the mouth. Sneezing worse during the night; fluent acrid coryza. The discharge of saliva flowing over the lips produces rawness, smarting and burning of the mucous membranes, and the lips, bleed. The fluid from the nose as it flows over the skin leaves red streaks.
"Acrid ichorous discharge excoriating the inside of the nose, the alae and upper lip."
That is expressive and occurs in diphtheria; in various forms of sore throat, in scarlet fever, when this remedy is indicated.
Inflammation of the tongue, with acrid discharge from the nose. Inflammation of the root of the tongue, of the throat and soft palate, of the tonsils. The glands of the neck are swollen.
This inflammatory condition is followed by paralytic weakness, making it impossible for him to swallow liquids or food, and when the mouth forces food into the pharynx the oesophagus refuses to operate, and then fluids and liquids are forced up into the nose and run out of the nose.
This has been clinically observed many times in diphtheria and sore throats. The sneezing is like an ordinary coryza, with repeated chills over the body, and aching in the bones as if the bones would break, like Nux, Eupator., Arn., Rhus, Bry. and Ars., that have aching all over during "cold."
This is one of the most striking medicines as an illustration of the keynote system, that is, with those who prescribe on one symptom and give this medicine whenever the patient bores his nose or picks his lips, notwithstanding that Cina bores the nose and picks the lips.
Cina has more of the congestive and nerve symptoms. The nostrils are really so sore from the acridity of the fluids inside of the nose that it feels as if the nostrils were filled with fire. This is the language of the patients who narrate their symptoms in an Arum triphyllum case.
They come into the office with a sore, raw nose, and it tingles and tickles and he cannot let it alone. Fluids run down over the lip and excoriate. The glands of the neck are often enlarged. When he takes cold in one nose there is soreness of the neck and parotid gland.
Desire to bore into the nose. This boring into the side of the nose is another symptom and differs from the one "boring the nose."
You will see children boring in the nose, inside of nose. it is an inflammation of the nasal duct, the duct that leads from the eye to the nose, and accompanied by a discharge of tears over the cheeks, with the tickling that extends up there which they cannot reach, but they undertake to reach it.
Can hardly talk on account of phlegm in the back part of the nose. He talks through the nose. The nose is filled with mucus and there is great tumefaction of all the mucous membranes; which gives him a nasal tone.
"Swollen, bloated face."
If you observe the nose and face you will be surprised to see that so much of the trouble is on the left side of the face, left nostril, left lachrymal duct, etc.
Mouth: There is bleeding of the lips, upper and lower. The under lip especially is denuded and drops of blood stand upon it, and the patient is constantly picking and pinching the lips, and when you request of the little one to stop it or take his hands away he yells with a sort of sepulchral yell.
"Children will often pick and bore into raw surfaces, though it gives them pain and they scream with it, but they keep on boring."
That is a striking symptom. Fluids make the lips raw and then this tickling comes on and he cannot let it alone, ho must keep at it.
"Appearance of raw bleeding surfaces on the lips, buccal cavity, nose, etc."
Great itching tingling describes it. In typhoid, where you would hardly expect much swelling of the parotid, these glands are enlarged. In diphtheria, scarlet fever and sore throat enlargement of the salivary glands.
This inflammatory condition with soreness and swelling of these glands; the glands are hard and tender to the touch. The tongue is red, the papillae elevated; the tongue appears to be almost denuded. It is raw and bleeding, sometimes does bleed in a few places, and sometimes, after this has gone on for a few days, when the tongue is projected it looks like a big red straw berry, and for that reason has been called
"Strawberry tongue." "Tongue cracked, bleeding, burning, painful; smarting on tongue and fauces."
Putrid odor from the mouth. Mouth foul, so sore that he was unwilling to drink. All this points to tingling and raw condition of the buccal cavity far back into the throat.
If you look into the buccal cavity you will see the parts raw, denuded and bleeding. Excessive flow of saliva, which is acrid. Mouth burns and is sore. Cries when anything is offered. Buccal cavity covered with diphtheritic ulcers, also with aphthous patches, which cover the whole mouth and tongue.
It says "stinging," but it is a painful tingling, stinging like the sting of a bee, stinging pains in the throat, and the parts are ulcerated, raw and bleed.
Stools: It has a diarrhoea such as occurs in idiopathic typhoid. If you have ever seen the yellow corn-meal mush when it is dropped on a plate, it has the appearance of the typhoid yellow stools. When this medicine is suitable diarrhoea is yellow like corn-meal; frequent, faecal, thin, mushy, yellow, is the description of this typhoid stool.
There are other times that the stool is dark brown, watery, thin. As is usual, the faeces are acrid. The thin faeces escape from the anus and keep the parts raw and burning. With other complaints, in typhoid especially, in the groin where the thigh bends upon the abdomen an excoriation takes place with acrid moisture.
Again, we notice rawness over the coccyx. A moisture and rawness from acrid fluid in the posterior part of the fissure back of the anus so that over the coccyx and back of the anus there is rawness and acrid moisture.
Voice: The voice comes in for art extensive part of the trouble. It has been found especially to relate to singers and public speakers.
At times when a lawyer has had a long case and he is making a final effort, and has been speaking three or four hours, and while in a sweat has got into a draft or gone out, he finds himself hoarse and cannot finish Ids speech, a dose of Arum triph. will enable him to go on with his speech in a clear voice.
If clears up the hoarseness. In public speakers and singers who have been compelled to strain the voice and have taken a little cold and the voice is hoarse after prolonged exercise; this is the most striking feature of the Arum triph. voice.
"Voice hoarse; from over-exertion of the voice is speaking or singing." "Voice uncertain, uncontrollable, changing continually, now deep, now hoarse, etc."
It manifests itself in this way. A person starts in a certain pitch and he cannot talk to you, but he tries another pitch and can talk. It is a queer thing that on certain notes they are voiceless, which shows that there is an irregular and patchy inflammation of the vocal cords; it is not a uniform inflammation or the voice would be uniformly affected.
"Clergyman's sore throat," is not a good expression, because it is clergyman's hoarseness that is meant; hoarseness and rawness of the throat of public speakers when talking.
Of course you would say any voice that is hoarse is aggravated when talking, but it is not always so.
The Rhus hoarseness carries with it its characteristic relief from motion, and the use of the voice is motion of the larynx.
When the Rhus patient commences to use the voice he finds that he is hoarse, but after using the voice a little it loosens up, becomes freer, or, in other words, it is better from motion. This may be so either in acute or chronic hoarseness.
Now, in this remedy as in Phosphorus, the voice is ameliorated from clearing the vocal cords of a little mucus. It is not so in Rhus tox., for it is a weakness and paralysis from cold. It is well known under Rhus tox. that the tendons and muscles that are rheumatic become weak, they are stiff on beginning to move and are ameliorated when they are warmed up; so it is with the voice.
Chest: Now, in the chest there is burning and rawness when coughing; this extends to the pit of the stomach.
"Raw feeling in chest."
"Lungs feel sore."
"Soreness in |. lung."
You will notice that many times patients and provers state sufferings are in the lungs, which may not really be the region affected. Most likely from what is known of other symptoms this burning is in the trachea, although it says in the lungs.
This remedy does have burning in the trachea, the whole length of it, during an attack of coughing, and burning in the larger branches of the bronchial tubes. The catarrhal state is largely confined to these parts, the trachea and bronchi, but this medicine has cured pneumonia It has been found useful as a palliative in phthisis.
It is used in crude form among the farmers as a domestic medicine for coughs and colds and as a palliative, in consumption. In many of the farm houses you will find the wild turnip hung up in strings like heads to be dried and, grated and used with sugar and cream.
I mentioned the fact that it seems to favor the left side of the head, the left nostril, the left side of the face. It also prefers the left chest and the left lung. It has soreness in the left side of the chest and left arm. it has a sensation of fullness in the thorax and soreness extending down and involving the left lung.
Here is a clinical picture of fever:
"Typhoid forms of fever; picking ends of fingers and dry lips till they bleed, etc."
In most of these complaints the urine is very scanty and is sometimes suppressed. You will very commonly note a good action of this medicine in these complaints by its immediately starting up a copious flow of
urine. It is a sign of relief.
It has upon the skin all the scarlet rash that you would expect to find in scarlet fever, and it has also the typhoid petechiae.
Asa Foetida
Introduction: This remedy in olden times was frequently abused for man and beast. Our grandfathers supposed it was a protection against disease and hence they used it in the stables.
Lumps of "foetty," as they called it, where put in the corn for the horse, to keep off distempter.
What it has accomplished I am unable to say, but it is certain that these farmers looked upon Asa foetida as a great protective against disease.
It has been used also by the laity as a medicine for fainting, for hysteria, and all sorts of nervous symptoms and complaints.
The use is justified by the proving. These things are scarcely worthy of note, but it shows the general use among the people, as a domestic medicine, in crude form. It has been used more extensively in this form than in professional practice in a legitimate way.
Aspect: There is one class of patients you will find who will trouble you. Those cases that come into your office with puffed, venous, purple faces; they have an appearance of plethora; the face looks puffed, bloated and dropsical at times; it is a dark red, dusky face; such a face we shall cure sometimes with Asa foetida. Carbo an., Aurum, Carbo veg. and Pulsatilla are also related to this kind of face, but it is a very troublesome face, it shows more or less cardiac disturbance and venous stasis.
The venous side of the heart will often be involved, or be about to be involved, when you have this kind of face.
I never like to see them come into my office, for they are hard cases to manage. They have deep-seated troubles, with bleeding, they are subject to sudden inflammations, and they do not rally quickly.
Constitution: In this constitution we have ulcerations; a little place will ulcerate and suppurate, and the ulceration will burrow; this is just what this remedy does.
Another thing this kind of constitution will do is to set up an inflammatory condition of the periosteum with swelling, periostitis of the tibia for instance, where the circulation is not very active; inflammation of cartilages with tumefaction and purple skin, stitching pains and dropsy, ulcerations and fistulous openings. This medicine is good for just such states.
"Ulcers with extreme sensitiveness." Patients often say, "I get no sympathy when I am sick because I look so well;" fat, flabby and purple.
This remedy will seldom be thought of in lean persons; they seem to be free from complaints like those of Asa foetida, but in fat, flabby persons, extremely nervous, extremely sensitive to pain, full of hysteria.
Purple when out in the cold, purple when excited. In other words, you see before you the venous constitution, and these people get the worst kind of hysteria; they go off almost from no cause into fainting; from a close room, from excitement, from any disturbance; sometimes cramps come on, but more especially fainting.
They are subject to stitching pains from the bone to the surface; that is, from within out. The periosteum, becomes irritated, and glands become swollen.
Syphilis sometimes produces this kind of condition. Vascular disturbances in the body; periostitis, necrosis, induration of glands, nerve syphilis and head pains. in old syphilitics with this kind of venous face, subject to bleeding, ulcers turn black or become purple. In this there is a similarity to Lachesis.
Old scars turn purple, threaten to suppurate, take! on a venous aspect, become painful and turn black. Ulcers form at the site of old scars in old syphilitic patients and sometimes in psoric patients. Most complaints come on during rest and are better by slow motion.
There is another grand feature running through this remedy; it is full of discharges, catarrhal discharges, discharges from ulcers, watery discharges from different places and even watery stool; and all these discharges are horribly offensive and ichorous.
Deep, flat ulcers from bone and periosteal affections give out a watery, bloody discharge that is horribly offensive, with pains shooting outwards. Get the idea of the venous stasis well fixed in your mind and with this syphilitic state added to it.
There are many pains running through the remedy and they are night pains like those of syphilis, nightly bone pains, and pains in the periosteum.
The ulcers are deep, with bluish edges. Varicose veins surround the ulcers. Inflammation of the bone and periosteum, with blueness all around the ulcers.
When there has been an inflammatory condition of the periosteum, somewhat passive in character, the skin adheres to the bone, glues down to it by adhesion. It is too feeble to ulcerate, it does not get up a likely inflammation, but only a passive state, The glands all over the body are hot and throbbing, with shooting, jerking pains, in syphilis or old psoric and scrofulous complaints.
The bone pains that are felt in the head are sometimes very distressing. Old syphilitic bone pains in the head, stitching, penetrating. It seems where there are lumps and nodules, about the head, this medicine seems to burry things. Shooting, stitching, tearing pains, under left frontal eminence.
This stitching pain is sometimes described as if a nail or plug were driven into the head. These nervous headaches are syphilitic hysterical or scrofulous; hysterical pains described as rending, tearing, stitching.
Head: All over the head there is stitching pain, but in the frontal eminence, in the temples, there is a sensation as if a nail or plug were driven in, and most of the pains seem to bore, as if they extended from the bone to the surface, and hence are said to be from within out.
Eyes: It is useful in old syphilitics who are subject to eye complaints, ulcers on the eyeball, ulcers on the cornea, ameliorated in the open air, with a sensation of numbness in the eyes; inflammation of the iris, with ragged appearance of the iris; they are subject also to severe, sharp stitching pains that come from within out.
The remedy is full of burning, and so the eyeballs burn, better in the open air. Iritis, but the inflammation sometimes involves the choroid, the retina, and mucous membrane, making a general inflammatory condition of syphilitic character.
There are tearing pains in various places around the eyes; sticking, stitching pains, worse at night. Ulcers, with stitching pains, worse at night. Burning. stitching in the eyes with dryness, so that the lids stick to the balls of the eyes, pain worse at night.
There is a misty appearance before the eyes, dullness as if looking through a fog. It also seems as if the atmosphere were filled with little floating black flies.
"Muscae volantes.”
You have looked into the air and seen little gnats and mosquitoes; well it appears to these patients as if these were there when they are not there. The discharge from the eyes is ichorous, bloody and often offensive.
This same syphilitic miasm may attack the car and the bones of the car. These bones may decay and the hearing be lost.
"Burning in the ear with discharge of foetid pus."
Stitching pains in the ears from within out.
Nose: A horribly offensive discharge comes from the nose; ulcers high up in the nose; caries of the bones of the nose; syphilitic ozoena. Putrid old catarrhs.
"Feeling as if the nose stopped high up, as if he could not breathe through it, with fullness of the head, when riding in a carriage." (Aurum, Aurum mur.)
Numbness is a great feature of this remedy, numbness of the scalp, or deep in the head; numbness here and there; numb, dead feeling associated with the pain; numbness after pain; often numbness after sleep.
Other nervous manifestations occur besides those that are hysterical. It has choreic motions. You would expect such a peculiar nervous constitution to have almost everything among its nervous symptoms.
"Constantly chewing and working frothy slime out of mouth, with swollen tongue." "Speech unintelligible." "Grinding of teeth; starting at night."
Swelling of the lips, and of the whole buccal mucous membrane, especially the lower lip, with burning in the mouth.
There are syphilitic symptoms in the throat, attended with the usual burning, darting, stitching in ulcers; pain when swallowing; a sensation of a ball rising in the throat, such as occurs in globus hystericus;
choking, must constantly swallow.
Hysterical and choreic affections of the oesophagus and trachea. Spasms of the oesophagus. This lump in the throat, or suffocation, is a sort of hysterical spasm of the oesophagus.
"Dryness and burning in the oesophagus."
Stomach: In the stomach troubles, if you have ever seen a typical case of Asa foetida, you will wonder where all the air comes from; it comes up in volumes.
"Hiccough-like contractions of the diaphragm."
Choreic jerkings of the diaphragm, with expulsion of wind like the sound of a pop-gun going off almost every second. It is a condition that the patient has no control over; It is like the shooting off of little, guns forcing loud belching, loud eructations of wind from the stomach.
There are a few symptoms mentioned in the text just here that are worthy of note.
"Pulsation in pit of stomach; perceptible to sight and touch."
"Pressing, cutting, stitching pains."
A queer observation has been made that flatus was not passed downward, but all upwards. "Eructations; smelling like garlic; tasting rancid, sharp or putrid."
Always horribly offensive. Offensiveness is a characteristic of the remedy. And then there is a "gone empty feeling in the pit of the stomach," not a pain.
"Pulsations after eating."
"Meteorism of the stomach."
Abdomen: The remedy has many gastric and abdominal complaints; full of bellyache; stitching pains, colic. The diarrhoea is more or less troublesome.
These patients are afflicted with diarrhoea from the slightest indigestion, after any indiscretion in diet, a painful watery diarrhoea.
"Liquid stools of most disgusting smell."
"Blackish-brown papescent offensive stools, which relieve.”
Genitals: "Bearing down in genitals, worse when riding in a carriage." "Uterine ulcer sensitive and painful."
This medicine has been very useful in palliating uterine cancer in such constitutions as described those with purple faces, never the very pallid ones.
Women of feeble, flabby, venous constitutions are subject to hemorrhages and miscarriages. Women who are not pregnant sometimes have the breasts fill up with milk, wonderfully annoying thing, and but few remedies have it; this is one of the few.
It has also deficiency of milk.
"Ten days after delivery milk diminished." These patients sometimes get hysterical asthma; all sorts of disturbance in breathing, dyspnoea. "Asthmatic feeling in trachea."
"Asthmatic attacks at least once a day all her life, brought on by every bodily exertion, coition, especially by every satisfying meal."
Attacks of dyspnoea after coition, like Ambra. "Obstinate titillating cough < at night."
Many of these complaints are worse at night; nightly aggravations. Syphilitic complaints are commonly worse at night and such anti syphilitic remedies as Mercurius, Staphysagria, Hepar, Nitric acid, etc. are all worse at night.
Among the other chest complaints, I will read a few of those that are marked here prominently and are striking ones.
"Pressure and burning of the sternum."
"Compression of chest as from a heavy weight."
"Stitches in chest."
"Single, violent stitches from within outward, at short intervals."
This remedy is full of rheumatism and gouty symptoms; gouty affections in general, in nervous constitutions.
When such a nervous constitution finally produces gouty formations, the nervousness often disappears; for it has been relieved by the deposit in the joints; a transformation scene has taken place.
Aurum Metallicum
Mind: The general features of the remedy are such as relate to the mind and such as relate to the tissues of the body in general. If you run through the mental symptoms, taking them all in as one great whole, you will see that all the affections, natural to healthy man, are perverted.
So great in extent is this that one of the fundamental loves, which is the love of living, of self-protection, is perverted and he loathes life, is weary of life, longs to die and seeks methods to commit suicide.
No love of life. The affections pre-eminently are deranged, the intellectual sphere is only secondarily changed.
Of course insanity runs through the remedy, but it is an insanity that begins in the will and proceeds to the intellect; it is first observed as a perversion of the affections.
It is astonishing that one could get into such a state of mind, such horrible depression of spirits that there is an absolute loss of enjoyment in everything.
You take away a man's hope, and he has nothing to live for, he then wants to die. Such, it seems, is the state in this medicine.
Self-condemnation, continual self-reproach, self-criticism, a constant looking into self; she does nothing right, everything is wrong, nothing will succeed, hopelessness.
"Imagines he cannot succeed in anything, and he does everything wrong; he is in disunion with himself." Imagines he sees obstacles in his way everywhere.
He is all the time imaging that he has neglected something, that he has neglected his friends.
He imagines that he deserves reproach in consequence of having neglected duty; he has neglected something, he is wrong, is wholly evil, has sinned away his day of grace, is not worthy of salvation; this is the train of thought that constantly runs through his mind.
The thought really becomes uncontrollable; he is absorbed in himself and sits and broods over it, and by brooding over it he only intensifies his present state and hatches new grievances, continues to worry over himself, thinks he is wholly unfit for this world, and then he longs to die.
He looks on the dark side of everything, constantly expecting bad news, looking for everything to go wrong. The future looks dark to him, and he wants to die; he never will succeed, for everything goes wrong that he
turns his hand to.
His business is dark, his family troubles him, his friends annoy him; he becomes extremely irritable, easily angered, is worried over trifles, and easily excited.
Every little thing rouses him into anger and turmoil, he is always in a vexation. The Aurum state of mind is an insanity dreadful to look upon because of its turbulence and melancholy.
It is suitable in the most profound states of melancholy and depression where the patient sits silent and says nothing. When disturbed he is aroused to great vehemence, anger and violence.
"Melancholy, feels hateful and quarrelsome." "Terrible melancholy after abuse of Mercury.”
The causes of this state of insanity are prolonged anxiety, unusual responsibility, syphilis and loss of property.
Persons who have been repeatedly drugged with Mercury, have established upon themselves a mercurial disease, with enlargement of the liver, and this is almost always attended more or less by melancholy and sadness and such hopelessness as we find in Aurum.
Aurum produces such affections of the liver as are associated with cardiac affections, endocarditis, dropsy of the heart and rheumatic affections that have gone to the heart.
You will notice that wherever the affections are pre-eminently disturbed in mental, disease that there is either cardiac weakness, endocarditis, enlargement of the heart, or some organic or functional disease of the heart.
You will very often find a history of taking Mercury that has superinduced a rheumatic state that has been rubbed away with liniments until the heart is affected, and with this comes hopelessness, insanity of the will, disturbance of the affections.
Then it appears to spread in this remedy from the will to the understanding, and the intellectual portion of man becomes involved. Think what a state it is for a man who has been in good condition of health, respected in his business circles, to have a desire to commit suicide.
You will see other kinds of insanity and a breaking down or a state of feebleness of the intellect, he cannot think nor reason; his affections are practically intact, but he finally goes into a state of imbecility, or he becomes wild and commits suicide from impulse.
That is an instance where the intellect has been affected first and spread to the will. Sometimes this state comes on, and no disturbance in the man's intellectual nature has been observed; it is intact, it is sound.
He has been sound in his business affairs, he has been a good father, he has been observed by those around him to be intelligent, but he has silently brooded over his state and his hatred of the world; he has told nobody of it, and then, he has been found hung in his room.
The man's intellectual nature keeps the man in contact with the world; but his affections are largely kept to himself. A man can have affection for all sorts of things and perversion of the affections, but his intellect will guide him not to show his likes and dislikes to the world.
The affections cannot be seen, but man's intellect is subject to inspection. He cannot conceal his intellect. We shall see that the affections are interior, they are covered with a cloak, they are his innermost and are hidden from inspection; but the understanding is the outermost garment, it surrounds and hides his affections, just as does the garment he wears over the body hide the body. The affections that Aurum resembles are those like unto the very innermost nature of man.
"Ailments from grief, disappointed love, fright, anger, contradiction, mortification." "Pain makes her desperate so that she would like to jump out of the window."
He meditates upon death, upon suicide; he wants to get out of the world, wants to destroy himself, has no love for his life which he thinks is worthless.
Bones and articulations: The remedy is full of rheumatic affections, not unlike such as are found in old mercurial cases; rheumatic affections with swelling of the joints; affections of the cartilages and bone, inflammation of the periosteum; thickening and induration of the periosteum. Indurations of glands; induration of the cartilages about the joints.
These are all of syphilitic and mercurial character. It is useful in old syphilitics when the bones are breaking down in any part of the body; the shin bones, nose bones, ear bones, any of the small bones.
Pains: Like syphilis and mercury, the complaints are aggravated at night, coming on in the evening and keep up all night. The pains are violent, they tear, the bones ache as if they would break, not in acute fevers but in old syphilitic bone troubles.
Knife-like pains in the periosteum. Pains in the joints rendering them immovable. Inflammation of the bone itself with caries.
It is not strange that the vascular coating of the bones, the periosteum, should be greatly affected because there is a strange vascularity, all over the economy, in this medicine.
Veins: The veins are enlarged, in a state of congestion and inflammation, and friable. The veins become thickened and tumefied. The blood vessels pulsate all over the body.
"Erethism or vascular fullness characterizes nearly all complaints."
Fullness of the veins of the extremities; this goes on until swelling appears with weakness so that dropsy is prevalent throughout the remedy. Oedema of the extremities, with pitting upon pressure, which occurs in heart and liver affections.
A false state of plethora seems to exist in the body and finally turmoil and excitement occur. Violent orgasms in the body, sometimes demonstrated as violent heat, coming in flushes with excitement.
Fidgetiness, feeling as if something dreadful were going to happen throughout the economy.
Then it settles into a state of quiescence for awhile and then this repeats itself. These violent orgasms come preparatory to the localization or establishment of some breakdown in the economy.
At times it is a cardiac affection, with marked oppression behind the sternum with dyspnoea on walking fast for going upstairs.
Endocarditis will have this turmoil in the body; by and by, look for albumin in the urine, look for enlargement of the liver, look for signs of cancer of the uterus, and deep-seated affections.
"Boring in bones." "Pains drive to despair."
The pains drive the patient out of bed at night and make him walk. This is seen in old syphilitic bone pains, and old mercurialized patients.
The patient has been taking Mercury all his life and his liver is enlarged, and his joints are enlarged. He goes to every doctor, with an endeavour to get relief from his distressing sufferings .
Mercury and disease are so mixed up that a great turmoil will result from your first prescription. He will go through these stages of violence and periodical attacks. You will have to know such medicines as Aurum, Chelidonium and Staphysagria to get this patient over these awful attacks which he is obliged to go through.
Glands: This medicine wonderfully affects the glands, the parotid glands, the glands about the groin, the lymphatics in the abdomen; in fact, the glands everywhere.
The mammary glands, the testes and ovaries, are involved, and undergo states of hardness, infiltration, etc.
Aurum, cures chronic enlargement of the testes, and lumps in the mammary glands. Tumors in these glands, of cystic character, have been cured by Aurum.
Hahnemann potentized Aurum and gave some of it to a patient, and it did not work, but he thoroughly triturated it until he got it to the fifteenth potency and then it worked and restored that patient to the bosom of his family.
Hahnemann says that in the earlier triturations the dose was yet too large to cure; so he went higher until it was sufficiently small to cure, sufficiently attenuated to go into the interior of the economy through the various envelopes of man.
There is one grand feature running through the Aurum state; it is the manner in which he is affected by temperature, and by the weather. Here are some symptoms that relate to the whole man, which must be examined in this connection.
"Desire for open air."
This patient ranks along with Pulsatilla as to temperature; but Aurum is not mild, gentle and yielding, he is obstinate, irascible, the very opposite of the Pulsatilla patient.
"Generally > growing warm." This is in connection with the headaches. "Cold water ameliorates pain in eyes."
"Averse to uncover," but he desires open air like Pulsatilla.
"Warm air, asthma <."
Many symptoms disappear after washing, especially cold washing; but whenever the patient is suffering from great excitement, turmoil and vascularity, constitutional orgasm, pulsations, he wants the doors and windows open, wants to get out in the cool air; wants the clothing thrown off.
This state of excitement and pulsation is ameliorated by the open air. It has those flushes of heat so, common to women at the critical period, and these are followed by sweat, sometimes by chilliness.
Most that we have said of the remedy is about its general aspect, for everything about the mind is general.
Head: In Aurum the pain in the head is very intense, maddening, often accompanied by a sensation as if air were blowing upon him; he looks around to see where the draft comes from when there is none; extremely sensitive.
Often has to have the head wrapped up, although it feels hot, with a good deal of congestion and rush of blood to the head. The head is sore and feels bruised. Stitching, burning, tearing pains in the head; much throbbing in the head. The face is bloated, flushed and shiny with the congestive headaches.
These headaches are often found in syphilitic subjects; often associated with cardiac disease. Pain in the back of the head associated with cardiac disease, with sluggish circulation, purple face, duskiness of the skin. Exostoses as in syphilis.
The skull bones are sensitive to touch; the periosteum is tender to touch. In old mercurialized cases with bone affections and necrosis of the skull, as in syphilis and mercury, the hair falls out copiously; the head becomes bald.
Baldness due to syphilis; the scalp is left shiny and the hair will not grow in again. In acute diseases there is falling out of the hair, but it grows in again. But young syphilitics often lose the hair and remain bald all the rest of their life.
Eyes: There are disturbances of the eye, of a catarrhal character, even to the extent of ulceration and infiltration of the various coatings of the eye.
Iritis: great disturbance of the whole visual apparatus; some of the striking features I will read from the book, but remember the constitution that we must always have in view; remember the mental state, the mercurial and syphilitic states, the gouty tendency, and the complaints that belong to joints, remember the cardiac disturbances.
As we review the eye symptoms we thus see the constitution with which they are likely to be associated. "Photophobia.” Weak sight and eyes.
"By gaslight a number of bright, floating specks and dots are seen."
"Eyes ameliorated by moonlight."
"Large letters cannot be distinguished."
"Yellow, cresent-shaped bodies floating obliquely upward in field of vision."
"In upper dark section of field of vision occasional showers of bright, star-like bodies."
In Calcarea there is a queer symptom; he sees a sudden flash arise from the lower portion of the field of vision; it shoots up and divides, and then he sees stars in every direction. It is the appearance you will see sometimes in the shooting off of one of those rockets that explode and come down in a shower.
That has been observed in Calcarea. "Hemiopia of the left eye."
And so it goes on with many of these peculiar things that can hardly be described except in the language of the text.
"Protruding eyes."
Protrusion of the eyes, such as occurs in exophthalmic goitre, with enlargement of the heart, has been cured by Aurum.
Enlargement of the thyroid gland with rapid and full pulse. Exophthalmic goitre has been cured by Aurum, Natr. mur.
"Starting, dreary look."
"Iritis marked by much pain around eye, which seems to be deep in bone."
Such a state would be likely to be produced by syphilis that had been treated with Mercury and Aurum would come in as an antidote to both the syphilis and the Mercury.
"Pupils irregularly dilated." It has catarrhal states of the eye. It has inflammation of the conjunctiva, choroid, iris and retina. Well, syphilis does this, taking hold of the eye in just this way and causing great infiltration.
Pains round about the eye; the thin plate bones, and the skull bones are all sensitive to pressure; the bones seem tender; periostitis; opacity of the cornea.
Ears: Syphilis often takes hold of the ear, affecting the bones of that organ.
"Caries of mastoid process, obstinate otorrhoea."
'
"Caries of the bones of the ear. ' "Parotids swollen, painful to touch, very sensitiveness to noises but music relieves". Humming, buzzing and rushing in ears. Rushing like the rushing of wind and falling water. "Annoying dryness in ears and nose."
This is all like the complaints to of syphilis, which are cured by Aurum, but Aurum also corresponds to and has cured many times otorrhoea following scarlet fever where there is even entire loss of the drum of the ear and loss of the bones.
Of course it does not restore hearing. Patients will come to you for car troubles, and you may find that the whole ear apparatus is destroyed; the mucous membrane and bones of the ear are all in a state of ulceration and necrosis and the discharge is foetid.
The patient consults you in order to have the hearing restored and it may not be possible; stops that ear discharge and restore the hearing are the only two things he thinks about.
If you go to-day to our ear specialists and speak about curing the patient, they would not know what you were talking about; the only thing that would be thought of would be the stopping of that ear discharge as quickly as possible.
They would examine the car to see whether it is intact or not; and if it is not, the hearing is of course gone and the stopping of the discharge is then all that is taken into consideration.
Homoeopathy teaches that the patient should be treated and the patient only, after which the organs and tissues become normal. The whole duty of the physician is to restore health to the patient. We have the nose specialists with their local applications.
These things will only bring on bone disease, and tubercular troubles; they stop the discharge from the nose, and of nature must have a vent somewhere and so she establishes a discharge in the chest; the trouble
progresses from the mucous membranes into the lung, into the parenchyma of the lungs, and is often of a tubercular character, and then these men tell you the bacilli have come.
This is spurious science. Clean, healthy tissues are the only safeguard.
Nose: Aurum is full of nasal troubles, with foetid discharge. The bones of the nose necrose; syphilitic necrosis, the nose flattens down; the bones are discharged. You see these people walking about with flattened-down nose and if you get near enough to them the stench will be observed. They are nearly all syphilitics.
A few remedies have the power of curing this syphilitic nose condition; Aurum, Mercury and Hepar are three of them.
I have cured this state a number of times with Hepar. I once cured a man after the bones were completely softened, so that when the nose was handled it would bend right over; only a sort of cartilaginous structure held the nose in place. I gave that patient Hepar. It cured him of syphilis after he had been filled in vain with Mercury.
"Coryza, thick discharge, like white of egg." "Mucous discharge from posterior nares in morning.”
Tip of nose knobby, red, like Lach.; strawberry nose. Little knobs on the nose composed of varicose veins in heart cases, with disturbance of the right side of the heart; sometimes found in old drinkers and in heart affections generally.
Face: Face red and swollen. Aurum has cured epithelioma of the wing of the nose and lip. Remember the horribly offensive odor from the nose, loss of smell following pains in the nasal bones; nasal catarrh.
"Ulcerated, agglutinated, painful nostrils." "Crusts in nose." "Nose feels obstructed as in dry coryza."
With nearly all of these nose affections, the patient is bowed down with sorrow, full of grief; black clouds hang over him and he wants to die. Loathing of life and wants to find some way to commit suicide.
"Puffy under eyes."
"Blue about nose and lips."
"Face glowing red. "
"Violent boring in right zygomatic process when walking." "Carious teeth."
"Toothache at night."
"Foul breath."
"Syphilitic ulcers in palate and throat."
"Boring in hard palate."
Liver: This medicine has cured craving for alcohol, the craving of drunkards.
Another marked feature of this medicine is its ability to harden, enlarge and inflame the liver; induration with cardiac affections; enlargement of the heart and liver.
When you take into consideration the venous system, the portal system and its close association with the heart in establishing the circulation of blood in the abdomen, and the work that it does in the abdomen as a great receiving apparatus, you will not be surprised to find that heart and liver affections are associated with hopelessness and despair.
Notice, on the other hand, something that will set you to thinking perhaps, in cases of phthisis, none of them is hopeless they think they are going to get well; the lungs are almost gone with tubercles, but he knows if he could only get up that little something out of the throat he would get well.
Notice then that peculiar relation between the lungs and the understanding, and between the heart and the will. With every little trouble located in the heart there comes hopelessness, but when the manifestation of disease is in the lungs there is hopefulness
Dropsical conditions of the abdomen. "Inguinal hernia."
"Tabes mesenterica."
All of the glands of the body are involved more or less. All sorts of disturbances of the sexual organs. "Testes indurated."
"Frequent nightly emissions." Complaints as the result of vices. "Hydrocele."
"Ulcers on scrotum after gonorrhoea." "Burning and stinging in perineum." "Condylomata around anus." "Induration of uterus.”
"Menses too late and scanty."
"Uterus prolapsed and indurated." "Leucorrhoea thick white."
Complaints in the uterus and region of the pelvis from straining and reaching up the arms; abortion from reaching up at the windows and fixing a curtain, etc.
Aurum is a medicine that is suitable for induration of the uterus and ulceration of the uterus as a result of repeated abortions.
When you study the loss of affections that is involve in such a state and the affections or lack of affections that are found in Aurum you can see a deep well grounded similitude in the symptoms, and that is the way to hunt a remedy.
It is in the sphere of the physician to examine into this state of mankind in which he can destroy his offspring and to examine into the nature of remedies producing such a state.
We see in Aurum this entire perversion of all the loves of mankind, and finally their entire destruction.
The symptoms of asthma and of difficult breathing you would naturally expect to be associated with the cardiac affections.
Notice this also, that the difficult breathing is of two kinds, such breathing as involves the lung, and such breathing as involves the heart. So it we have an asthmatic condition of dyspnoea that is cardiac in character, and dyspnoea that is purely respiratory.
These are entirely distinct in character; one belongs to such remedies as have a predominance of action on the affections, and another belonging to those having a predominance of action on the intelligence; one will involve the lung and finally bring on emphysema; the other one is entirely different in its character, with irregular heart action, and only secondarily associated with emphysema.
Study your pathology with these things in mind and you will be able to perceive the nature of sickness and its results. These things are not mere observation, whims and theories, but are the outcome of studying
things from internal to external.
in this remedy the pains wander from joint to joint and finally locate in the heart. Angina pectoris is often the ending of an old rheumatism that has wandered from joint to joint.
"Difficult breathing." If the case goes on a little while, there will be blood spots, and if he lie on the right side the lower part will
be dull on percussion and the upper part will be resonant. Palpitation with great agony. Extreme oppression in the region of the heart on walking fast and going upstairs with oedema of the lower limbs.
Aurum Muriaticum
Generalities: This remedy exercises a profound action upon the mind and body. The patients suffering from latent syphilis are over-sensitive to it, and often require it in their complaints.
It has many bone symptoms and pains and they are worse at night. Its catarrhal condition is very much like that found in old cases of syphilis, such as had long treatment with Mercury and Iodides.
it is a rheumatic constitution also and is useful in acute and chronic rheumatism. It has cured rheumatic fever where the joints have been mostly affected but are now better and the heart is the principal seat of suffering. Many complaints are associated with cardiac disease.
Dropsical states from heart disease, from liver affections, with albumin in the urine after scarlet fever or with intermittent fever. Where old syphilitics continue to lose flesh. The glands and parts inflamed become indurated. It has been useful in cancerous glands. Inflammation of the bone and periosteum; caries, exostosis after Mercury in latent syphilis.
Caries of the joints with nightly boring and gnawing pains. It has burning pains in many parts. The pains are tearing, drawing, pressing and stitching. Many symptoms come on during rest and some during motion.
Modalities: Cold, wet weather ameliorates. Warm air, warm bed, warm room, warm wraps, becoming warm even in open air, and warmth in general aggravates the general feeling. Exertion and walking increase many symptoms.
The palpitation, suffocation and great weakness come from walking and exertion. While open air ameliorates he is even in the open air incapable of exertion. Fast walking is impossible.
The nervous symptoms are very marked. Excitement, sensitive to noise, starting when spoken to, starting in sleep. When the above symptoms are concomitants of heart and liver diseases this remedy will most likely be useful.
Fullness of the veins all over the body is a strong feature of this remedy. It is a most useful remedy in patients suffering from the chronic effects of gonorrhoea and syphilis, where fig warts and syphilitic ulceration are present together.
Mind: The mental symptoms are largely such as are found in Aurum. It has the same suicidal disposition. His mind dwells upon his broken health until he becomes low-spirited and desires death. He loathes his life. Weeping and aversion to his occupation. Indolence. The melancholia of old syphilitics. Extremely anxious with palpitation.
Said to be "full of whims and notions."
Extremely irritable. Nothing can be done to please him. Constant fretting. Extreme mental and physical restlessness. He walks the streets slowly, to be in the open air which ameliorates; he is much worse in the house, and in the warm room.
Thinking about his complaint caused the heart to beat strong and fast. Symptoms worse after fright, vexation and mortification. When the general symptoms mentioned above strongly predominate it will cure the particulars in the various parts below.
Head: It cures violent syphilitic headaches with vertigo. Violent left-sided headaches. Intense ache in forehead. Burning in occiput. Cerebral congestion. Pulsating in the head. Pain ameliorated by cold application.

Ears: Buzzing, ringing and roaring in the ears followed by deafness. A sensation as if the ears were open. Music relieves the ear symptoms. Eczema behind the ears. Burning and itching behind the ears at night.
Nose: It is one of the most useful remedies for catarrh of the nose in patients who are sensitive to the warm room.
It classes with Pulsatilla and Kalium sulphuricum, as both of these are better in the open air. The discharges of the remedy are thin or thick like pus, very offensive and, sometimes bloody, and there are many hard crusts in the nose.
Bleeding of the nose on blowing out of the crusts. Yellow, greenish discharge. It cures the most stubborn syphilitic catarrh. The nasal bones become sensitive to pressure. Caries of the bones of the nose. Red, swollen nose.
Deep cracks about the wings of the nose. Lupus of the wings of the nose. Infants with inherited syphilis with snuffles and indented nose.
Face: The circumscribed red face with pallor of face and neck in heart complaint, palpitation on slight exertion, pressure behind the sternum when walking, suffocates in a close room, wants cool air, ameliorated by gentle motion and we have a combination that this remedy often cures.
The pale face with red spot on each cheek is not that which is found in consumption, but in heart complaint.
The infant's face looks old. Acne on the face. There is often a red, healthy look on the face of very sickly people. Red faced from venous stasis; it is a false plethora, like that described in Aurum.

Baptisia
Generalities: Baptisia is suitable for acute diseases. It is principally a short-acting medicine, suitable for complaints that are not long lasting. So far as we know it is not an antipsoric, does not go deep into the life.
All of its acute diseases and complaints have the appearance of Zymosis, like scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhoid, and gangrenous complaints. There is one thing that is unusual about it, it brings on this septic state more, rapidly than most other remedies.
The zymotic complaints of Ars., Phos., Rhus, and Bry., are much slower in their pace. But Baptisia is suitable for typhoids that come on rapidly, and hence it is not so often suitable in idiopathic typhoids.
When an individual comes down suddenly from cold, from malaria, from drinking poisonous waters, and from any zymotic or septic cause he is hurled into bed in a few days, instead of going through a period of four, five or six weeks. The old idiopathic typhoid fevers come on slower.
Baptisia is suitable for those blood poisons that are highly septic such as the puerperal state, such as scarlet fever. He comes down perhaps with the appearance of a sudden violent break down, with a remittent fever.
But all at once it turns continued, and takes on septic symptoms. So much for its progress and its pace. Every medicine must be observed as to its velocity, as to its pace, as to its periodicity, as to its motion, and its wave.
Looking and smelling: We get that by looking at the symptoms. You take an individual who has been down in a mine, in the swam, down in the mud, in the sewers, who has inhaled foul gases, who goes into bed with a sort of stupor, from the very beginning he feels stupid. It is not gradual, but he goes down very suddenly, and he is stupid.
He is prostrated. His face is mottled. Sordes begin to appear on the teeth much earlier than in the regular typhoid. The abdomen becomes distended much earlier than in a regular typhoid; that is one who is accustomed to observing those things knows they are postponed for a number of days; while with this remedy the third day the abdomen is distended, his mouth is bleeding, and is putrid.
His odors are horrible; and he is in a marked state of delirium, such as would not be expected until the typhoid is out for many days. So it has rapid running diseases. It has velocity.
That is, he is going down toward death rapidly. He is increasing in his prostration more rapidly than usual. It is not a gradual decline of days and weeks.
He goes into a state of stupor. When aroused he takes on delirium. It does not matter whether it is scarlet fever, or typhoid fever, or a septic surgical fever, or a puerperal fever, or what.
He has fever, and if you look at him, and talk to him, and turn him over, and rouse him up, and make him realize that you want to say something to him - which is difficult - he gives you the impression that he has been on a big drunk.
That is the first thought you will have in a Baptisia case. His countenance is besotted. It is bloated and purple and mottled. Blood oozes from the mouth. You have seen the besotted countenance of drunkards, and it is like an old drunkard.
Mind: His mind seems to be gone. He does not know what be is talking about lie is in confusion, and when aroused be attempts to say some thing, and utters a word or two and it all flits away, and he is back in his state of stupor again.
No matter what disease that comes in, no matter what inflammation is present, no matter what organ is inflammed, if that state of the blood that can give rise to such symptoms and such sepsis is present, if that state of the mind is present, it is Baptisia.
Discharges: All of the discharges are putrid. The odor is cadaverous, pungent; penetrating. His perspiration, if he has any, is sour, foetid, pungent, and penetrating.
If he has no sweat the body gives off an odor that is unaccountable. The odor is so penetrating that on going into the front door the whole house, if the room is open, is filled with the odor. The odor from the stool is putrid and so penetrating that it can be detected on first going into the house.
Now, a strange thing that runs through the remedy is a peculiar kind of mental confusion, in which he is in a constant argument with his parts.
Delirium: He seems to feel that there are two of him. He realizes a dual existence whenever he is roused up. He will begin talking about the other one in bed with him.
It is said clinically that "his great toe is in controversy with his thumb." Or, "one leg is talking to the other leg."
Or, one part is talking to another part; or, he is scattered around over the bed; tumbles and you ask him what he is trying to do.
"why, I am trying to get those pieces together."
He never succeeds; he is in delirium, Of course these are only examples; you will get a new phase every time you get a Baptisia case.
Most of the time he is un conscious except when roused. Sometimes mutters. You will see his lips go, and you rouse him to see what he is about, and he is trying to get the pieces together.
"Confused as if intoxicated."
There are stages when he is not quite so stupid, and he is sleepless and restless. That is the exception. Most, generally you will find him lying upon one side curled up like a dog, and he does not want to be disturbed.
Again, when the stupor is not so great he is restless and turns and tosses. In that case he cannot sleep, because he cannot get the pieces together. He feels if he could once get matters together he could go to sleep, and these parts that are talking to each other keep him awake. His mind wanders as soon as his eyes are closed. Dullness, especially at night. Indisposition to think. Mind seems weak.
There you find the whole picture of the mental aspect in all complaints, in all acute diseases but they all come on ina hurry.
They are zymotic, of a low form such as scarlet fever, such as malignant diseases; and yet it takes ona continued type of fever.
These patients will die in from ten to twelve days if let alone. Whereas, ordinary typhoid will run for weeks, and sometimes die at the close of four weeks in a crisis.
The bleedings are black and offensive. The putridity is marked. In the mouth, the mucus from the throat and nose is bloody and putrid. It has a diarrhoea.
Stools: Thin, faecal, watery, yellow. It has a typical typhoid discharge; the most typical typhoid stool is like yellow corn-meal mush, coming on many times a day, but soft, pappy, just about the consistency of soft mush.
This remedy has that stool, but it is not the commonest form - but the black, the brown, the dark. In treating a good many cases of typhoid it was my fortune to observe a large number of Baptisia cases, which the remedy cured promptly.
The stool where the Baptisia did the most service was like ground up slate, slate colored, brownish. The odor was penetrating. In addition to that I have seen this medicine cure that kind of diarrhoea when it was
slate colored, even thin as water, if it was horribly putrid like decomposed meat; like the cadaver, attended with great prostration.
I have seen it cure that diarrhoea when there were none of the elements of typhoid fever present a simple prostrating form of diarrhoea.
Exhaustion. Exhaustion comes rapidly. In three days he has a deathly sinking coming over him.
Headaches: The headaches are nondescript. Only those congestive attacks, frontal headaches - violent pains in the head, and especially in the occiput, such as occur in the low forms of disease.
I hardly ever go into the details of headaches. Baptisia is not a headache remedy. It is not a remedy that we
would single out to treat headaches with, except such violent pains in the head of a congestive character that are associated with this low form of fever.
Face: It has characteristic eye symptoms. Congestion. Redness.
Pains in the eyes, and back of the eyes. So it has with hearing. So it has with nasal symptoms. But associated with fevers. But as soon as we come to the face we begin to realize the Baptisia symptoms, that besotted expression.
The countenance shows that. The eyes show it, the face shows it. And these are the symptoms: "Dark red with besotted appearance. Hot and perceptibly flushed; dusky."
That tells the whole story. Burning; beat in the face.
"Critical sweat on forehead and face. Anxious, frightened look."
On rousing from sleep looks as if he had a horrible dream.
And then comes the mouth, and the teeth, and the throat, and the tongue, all show marked Baptisia features.
The tongue is swollen, painful, offensive. Covered with black blood. Raw; denuded. Stiff and dry as leather. Described as if it was made of wood, or burnt leather; ulcerated. Ulceration runs all through the remedy.
Aphthous patches. These little ulcers that start no bigger than a pin-head become black and are so offensive and run together so that the whole surface of the mouth will be in a state of ulceration; raw and denuded, oozing a thick saliva that is putrid.
Throat: The throat takes on ulceration; is raw and bleeding.
There may be diphtheritic exudations in the throat, but round about it there are those low, dark, offensive surfaces. The throat is greatly swollen, and it is with difficulty that he can swallow.
Baptisia has been a very useful remedy in gangrenous sore mouth and sore throat. "Cancrum oris.” The ulcers spread rapidly and eat rapidly.
They are really phagedenic. Sordes form rapidly on the teeth. And when he is roused from sleep after a few hours of stupor there is a building up on the lips and around the corners of the mouth ridges of dry blood; very offensive.
Bleeds much from the mouth, throat and nose. Thick oozing. Putrid.
"Tongue red, and dry in the middle, The roof of the mouth swollen and feels numb. Foul or bitter nauseous taste in the mouth. Tongue of a dark hue. Tongue dry, brown down the centre. Tongue covered with a thick, brown crust. Tongue yellowish white, deeply furred."
Ulcers all over the mouth. Baptisia has cured the ulcerated sore throat of young mothers - and nursing sore mouth in children, when the parts become dusky and ulcers spread, and the mouth is putrid, and
prostration is coming on rapidly. The child or the mother is growing weak with great rapidity, is becoming prostrated.
Now, all this without fever.
Many of these ulcerative states in Baptisia are not attended with fever, it seems sometimes as though there were not life enough to get up a fever. Aphthous appearance in typhoid, in children, and with nursing mothers.
Canker sores in the mouth. "Putrid ulceration of the whole buccal cavity."
Now, with all this trouble saliva pours into the mouth, is thick and ropy and runs all over the pillow; like we find in Mercury.
The sore throat may be gangrenous. A strong feature of it is that the ulcers are rapid and painless, as if numb, without sensation. But it has a painful sore throat.
"Fauces dark red; dark, putrid ulcers; tonsils and parotids swollen. Putrid sore throat. Tonsils and soft palate swollen, not accompanied by pain."
Great swelling; great tumefaction; purplish.
The darker it is the more likely would I be to think of Baptisia -but never a bright red. I have never seen the Baptisia mental state associated with a bright red appearance. That low form of mental state is associated with blood decomposition, with duskiness, with a dark appearance of the skin, and of the mucous membranes. Not bright red, not pink, as we find in Bell.
Bellis more commonly bright red, although it has duskiness, but nothing to the extent of Baptisia. There is nothing like the putridity in Bell. that there is in Baptisia. "Oesophagus feels as if constricted from above down to stomach."
Oesophagus: Now, we have another phase of it. From the sore throat the trouble extends into the oesophagus, and the oesophagus is at first in a state of spasm. Later it is paralyzed. Fluids will at first go down the throat, but he cannot swallow a particle of solids.
The bolus of food will go into the upper end of the oesophagus and there it chokes him and feels like a lump, and he chokes and struggles and gags and throws it back, and then takes water or fluids.
He can swallow fluids but he cannot swallow solids. Every particle of solid food gags; but he can swallow liquids. Natr. mur. and quite a number of other remedies have spasms of the oesophagus coming on with nervous complaints, but in this low state I know of no other medicine having that one symptom, having these features, and the paralysis, and the spasmodic condition of the oesophagus.
"The oesophagus feels as if constricted from above down to the stomach."
Constrictive feeling causing frequent efforts at deglutition; throat sore, feels constricted. Can swallow only liquids. Children cannot swallow solids. The smallest solid substance causes gagging, thus he cannot use anything but milk; sometimes, thin, watery, offensive passages day and night; associated with the putridity, with the offensiveness, with the duskiness and with the prostration.
You need to know no more, if it is diphtheria, or scarlet fever, if it is typhoid fever, that will lead you toa certain remedy.
"Paralysis of the organs of deglutition."
To draw out from every remedy that which is positive to get the associations that make up a particular remedy and that only is the duty of every clinician.
Abdomen: The abdomen is distended; the stomach is distended. We may have these symptoms in inflammation of the liver, when this remedy would be useful. Along with the diseases that I have mentioned, tympanitic abdomen.
Great soreness in the right iliac fossa; so sore and tender, no bigger than a fist; but all of this putridity, - I am sure, would prevent you from using a knife to cut off that little appendix.
"Foetid, exhausting diarrhoea. Aphthous diarrhoea which means that the parts of the anus that roll out are ulcerated, little aphthous patches inside of the margin."
"Involuntary diarrhoea." Involuntary urine and stool in these low forms of disease. "Dark brown, mucous and bloody stools. Foetid stools."
It has dysentery. After confinement the lochia stops. Great tenderness of the abdomen. All these putrid signs-breaking down of the blood, the appearance of the face, the sudden prostration, suddenly becoming stupid; and add to that the mental symptoms-these are all signs for Baptisia in puerperal fever.
Now, intermingled with this after the case has been running on a few days the limbs become helpless and tremulous.
The tongue when it is put out is tremulous. The hand when it is raised is tremulous, and the limbs are tremulous. Quivering all over the body. Prostration. increases. The jaw drops and he lies upon the back unconscious, with the mouth wide open. He gradually slides down toward the foot of the bed.
A peculiar sort of paralytic weakness. This is how the prostration increases with the disease; but even yet when he is as low as this, with the signs present, Baptisia will break that fever. Baptisia will stop the typhoid
fever, when it is indicated. Prostration and trembling Huddles down in bed, feels as if sinking away.
Lies in a semiconscious condition when she appears dying. Excessive drowsiness. Delirious stupor, Lies in a semi-comatose state.
"Discharges and exhalations foetid.”
Breath, stool, urine, ulcers; all putrid. Ulceration of mucous membranes.
Baryta Carbonica
Generalities: Baryta carbonica is an interesting study, because it is fully proved and a constitutional remedy. Such remedies are always more interesting than the short-acting, superficial ones. They take hold in deep-seated, long-lasting, miasmatic troubles.
This remedy looks towards the development of the young. You will see in the text commonly expressed under this medicine, "dwarfishness.”
That does not always mean small in stature as it is spoken of in this remedy. Dwarfishness in body and mind; mental dwarfishness, and dwarfishness of organs.
You realize what precocity means; young persons who are unusually brilliant; well advanced mentally. We say they are beyond their years. They are precocious.
Get this in mind first, and think what it means; and then in the Baryta carb. constitution, we have the very opposite state.
That is what we mean by dwarfishness. Children are late coming into usefulness; or activity; late with their studies; late! learning to talk; late learning to read; late learning to make the combinations that enter into life; late learning to take in images, and form perceptions; to take on their activities; to do their work.
Late: We say sometimes that Calc. carb. is late in learning to walk, but Baryta carb. is also late learning to walk, although it has an entirely different cause.
To express it in a common, old-fashioned way, Baryta carb. is late learning how to walk, even with pretty good limbs. Calc. has miserable, weakly limbs, flabby muscles, poor bones, and hence he is late learning to walk.
"Late walking" is Calc. "Late learning to walk" is Baryta carb.
It competes also with Borax and Natrum mur. All three of these medicines have a peculiar kind of tardiness in the development of the brain, so that they are late learning to do things; late in developing.
But Baryta carb. leads them all in this late coming into the activities and uses of life.
You will have patients to treat, where this slow development manifests itself in girls. 18 to 25 years of age, who do the things they did when they were children, and say things as they said them when they were children.
"Childish manner of doing things, and childish behavior. Playing with dolls and saying foolish things."
They have not come into womanhood. They are late in taking on the activities and uses of the woman. They lack the prudence of the woman. They have not become circumspect, and say things just as a boy or just as a little girl would say them.
That is the dwarfishness of the mind. To appreciate that late development, and to see it in Baryta carb. from all of its symptoms and peculiar features, leads to a strong grasp of the remedy.
There is some of this found in such remedies as Graph., Sulph. and Calc., but nothing compared to this remedy. This seems to suspend the development that makes the child into a man or a woman.
It is not a small person that makes me think of Baryta carb., but the dwarfishness that is mental, and that is of organs.
Organs, as it were, become paralyzed, or one organ does not develop. It stops, and the others go on. That would make me think of this remedy. A single organ fails to mature, and the others go on; one-sidedness, a partiality of development.
Lymphatic glands: The next grand feature of this remedy is its affinity for the lymphatic glands all over the body. The glands all over the body enlarge and indurate; the glands of the neck, the glands of the groin, the lymphatics in the abdomen are all affected-knotty chains form in the neck.
With a few other things that we will put together shortly we will see in this patient a peculiar figure. It has emaciation-gradual dwindling in persons who have been fat, who have been well nourished.
It has an enlarged abdomen. It has been found suitable in marasmus, for children with enlarged glands, enlarged abdomen; emaciation of the tissues, emaciated limbs and dwarfishness of mind, and you have there all the whole Baryta carb. marasmus.
The patient himself is chilly; sensitive to cold; wants to be well wrapped. Marked weakness with feeble pulse is a strong feature and he must lie down; he is worse standing and sitting.
The weakness is worse after eating. His pains are better from motion and in the open air. His complaints are aggravated by cold. The enlarged glands take on tenderness and congestion from being exposed. The tonsils gradually increase. The glands of the neck increase in size, and in hardness, from every cold and from becoming chilled.
"Swelling and induration of glands. Inflammation of glands with infiltration.”
Infiltration belongs to the remedy. The glands become harder and harder. Ulcers become indurated in their base. Open sur faces become indurated in their walls.
When a child has almost any disease, measles, scarlet fever, mumps, or even a bad cold, or a malarial attack, the development ceases and dwarfishness results, a state in which he was not born, but a state that he has acquired, arrest of development.
It brings on emaciation and dwindling of the whole body, except the abdomen, which gradually enlarges. These are phases not to be overlooked in the very beginning, because the symptoms only help to establish this basis and these troubles and tissue changes come on as ultimates.
Another grand feature in this remedy is the application of these things to more advanced years. We say this is a childhood state, this is the state of youth and arrested development.
Now it does not matter whether we have this arrested development in youth, in childhood, or at the advanced age of fifty. From some strange circumstance which we are not able to fathom we say the individual is taking on the, appearance of old age.
Premature old age: We call it premature old age. Baryta carb. has cured lingering complaints that have resulted from malaria, overwork, mental or physical, prolonged mental strain, when the appearance of premature old age was a prominent feature.
Old age creeps upon him too soon. There is but little difference between childhood and old age, and hence old age is called second childhood; but we always regret to see a man under seventy becoming childish, and yet we do see many becoming simple and childish. It does not mean merely imbecility, but childlike behavior.
Doing and saying things like a child. So in premature old age these symptoms lead us to think of Baryta carb.
Baryta carb. has cured fatty tumors, encysted tumors, lupus, outward growths of tuberculous character, sarcoma; and it has mitigated the pains and sufferings and has prolonged life in cancerous affections.
Mind: Mentally it is worthy of careful study, and we will see cropping out in the mental symptoms all of the phases intermingled with tissue changes.
The Baryta carb. child will be seen hiding behind the furniture when strangers come in; will hide as for shame of something or as if afraid. It imagines all sorts of strange things, that it is talked about, or laughed at.
It does not seem to advance. It does not seem to do any good to teach it, for it does the same things over and over and remains untrained. They either cannot comprehend, or they can not memorize, or they cannot maintain a thought, and you go over it and over it, and the mother wonders if that child is ever going to learn something, and the teacher reports that the child lacks capacity.
The teacher cannot comprehend it, the mother cannot comprehend it, but the homoeopathic physician should know all about it at once. If he knows his Materia Medica he should be well up in the development of a feeble child; those who are going towards rickets, who are feeble, who are always depending on somebody, fitted only for menial places.
The homeopathic physician does well when he trots the little Johnnies and the little Susies on his knee and takes a good fair observation of their ability, and of what they lack, and understands how to build up what is lacking. Is not that in itself worth working for?
It requires all of the potencies that have ever been made to master constitutions. Some will require medium potencies, some very low, some very high. Let us not deprive our little ones of anything they need. Only so we look forward to the highest use, to develop them into their fullest capacity.
There is an expression here in the text,
"Want of clear consciousness.”
Do we not see from what I have said, what that must mean in this remedy, and that it is different in this remedy from what it is in a good many others?
And yet if you had read that symptom first you would not have appreciated it.
"A want of clear consciousness."
Especially in old age has that been useful. It is not that confusion of mind that we know to be dizziness. But he is not clear in his intellect. We see how this medicine takes hold of the intellect. It takes hold of his
memory. It begins with a feeble state, and it gradually travels toward imbecility.
You press it to its extreme and it has imbecility, and up to this we have degrees all along the line from the very beginning, from a mere matter of cloudiness in his thoughts to imbecility.
When the Baryta carb. babies appear in the clinic they will keep the hand up over the face and peek out through the fingers.
Bashful. Timid. Easily frightened. Afraid of strangers. Other remedies have similar features, but it is a strong feature of this medicine. Withered face. Sickly countenance. It is the idea of hiding, the idea of timidity.
The child does not want to play, and it sits in the corner. Does not pay any attention to its hammer, if it is a boy; or its doll, if it is a girl. Sits and sits. Does not seem to be thinking; a lack of ability to think.
Children grow up without any distinctiveness, without any ability to perceive, and therefore fail to develop. Always. borrowing trouble.
Like Caust., fear of something going to happen. Full of imaginations; imaginary cares and worries. Hatching up all sorts of complaints and grievances that may happen. A good deal like Ars. Children in a constant
whining mood; always whining. Running through the complaints will be the sufferings of the parts, or the men symptoms.
"The more he thinks about the complaint the worse it gets."
If he thinks about his troubles, his sufferings, they at once grow worse. Premature old age and brain fag from prolonged mental work.
Head: Troublesome headaches. "Pressure in the brain."
A feeling of looseness in the brain, as if the brain fell from side to side or was rising and falling. A sensation of motion in the brain when moving the head or from sudden jar.
Seems as if the brain moves to and fro to correspond to the motions of the head when the head is turned from, side to side.
"Pressing headaches."
Headaches ameliorated in fresh air, in the open air, and aggravated from heat. That is the opposite of its general state. The Baryta carb. general state is aggravated from cold; he is sensitive to cold, and his complaints come on from becoming cold; but his headaches are ameliorated in cool air.
The Baryta carb. patient is often sensitive to the extremes of heat and cold. Hot weather will bring on complaints. Hot weather will cause the blood to mount to the head, and favors apoplectic conditions.
It has many complaints of the head like unto the stupor of apoplexy. It has some of the paralytic conditions analogous to the complaints in old apoplectics, and it has been very useful in re-establishing the supply and
flow of nerve force along the nerves.
It parallels Phos., and is an excellent remedy for old paralytic conditions that have come from a rupture of a blood vessel, and therefore pressure upon the nerve supply.
The headaches are congestive, pressive headaches; a feeling of pressure in the brain.
These puny infants, such as we have described, have eruptions upon the head; eczema upon the head; and those who are born for better things have the eruption driven back by ointments and applications.
"Moist crusts upon the scalp."
"Dry eruptions upon the scalp. Falling off of the hair. Baldness."
Head complaints and a dwarfish state of mind, an intellectual defect, as results of suppressed eruptions. Eyes: It is full of eye symptoms.
"Granular lids. Thickening of the eyelids, thickening of all of the membranes and tissues about the eyes. Opacity of the cornea."
Infiltration of the various coverings. It has cured cataract it has cured various kinds of dim sightedness, but especially in those that things look hazy,
"looking as through a fog or through smoke."
Ulceration of the cornea. Little white spots, causing defective vision .
"Lids agglutinated in the morning." Styes.
"A sensation of weight in the upper lids."
A sensation of weight in the brow with headaches as if the forehead was pressing down over the eyes.
Like Carbo veg., Carbo an. and Natr. mur. The patient will often grasp the whole forehead with the hands, and say,
"I feel as if the forehead was pressing down over the eyes."
Ears: he has many noises in the ears, but especially cracking and flapping when breathing, swallowing and chewing; better while lying. It affects the right ear most. Rushing sounds in the ears when breathing.
"Eruptions about the ears. Glandular swellings and eruptions about the ears." Inflammation of the parotid glands, with hardness.
First, it may be called swelling, but it is finally permanent enlargement and induration, and it means a great growth sometimes.
Other glands about the neck are affected in association with the ear troubles. Knots of lymphatic glands down the neck under the ear (Bar. m., Tub.).
Sometimes the sub-maxillary gland is affected, being enlarged and indurated. Sometimes the tonsils enlarge and indurate. All these glands inflame and become sensitive, and get a little larger, after any exposure to cold, and from sudden changes of the weather, It is a wonderful medicine for the cure of enlarged glands.
Tonsils: Clinically it is laid down in the books for suppuration of these glands, but all my life I have failed to find it a good remedy for suppuration. The inflammation is more likely to turn into an increased infiltration.
It is laid down in the books here for suppuration of the tonsils, but from long experience it is one of the last remedies I would think of for suppuration of the tonsils. It may have done so, but it has not been my
observation that it runs that way, and I am very much in doubt about the great value and high marking of that observation. But it certainly has infiltration gradually increasing from becoming cold.
The enlarged tonsils will redden up and inflame and become painful, and the acute inflammation and pain will subside, but the tonsils are a little larger than with the last cold. In that way the tonsils keep growing. In children these are often cut out.
There are instances in which I might admit it was necessary to cut them off, when there is a wonderful superabundance, creating much disturbance in swallowing and in speaking.
Two or three times I have absolutely failed to cure with remedies selected to the best of my ability, and they have gone to the surgeon and he has cut them off; but I believe these tonsils ought to be all cured.
One thing in Homoeopathy taught in Hahnemann's Organon is that unless there are symptoms to indicate the remedy, no great things should be expected from the administration of the remedy.
The enlargement of the tonsils alone is not a symptom upon which a remedy can be selected, and it necessitates guessing a dozen times, and perhaps not hitting at all.
That is the worst sort of practice, guessing at a remedy; yet there are children having enlarged tonsils that appear to us without any symptom whatever to select a remedy by.
The symptoms to prescribe on are such as represent the patient, not the glands; not the changed tissue. We must always regret that the surgeon must come in, for in cutting off anything it may be done to the constitutional detriment of the patient.
Yet there are things that have to be done that we know are to the constitutional detriment of the patient. We have to keep servants on their feet to earn their living, and operations have to be performed upon them, because they cannot lie up a year or two to be cured.
The surgeon will always have a place with us, but let us do our part as physicians first.
Eruptions upon the face. The face is sickly, often purple, red and bloated, or lean and emaciated, looking old and withered. The infant looks like a little old person, like the state we find in Nat. mur. and Calc. With face troubles, with teeth troubles, and especially with throat troubles, enlarged glands under the jaw and down the neck.
Ear diseases following scarlet fever. Enlargement and induration of the parotids and of the submaxillary glands after scarlet fever. Scarlet fever often stirs up much trouble in the economy, especially when it has not been properly treated, when it has been treated by the allopath, or by a nervous homoeopath.
A nervous homoeopath is one who does not wait for his own convictions to be ultimated, does not wait for his remedy to work, and he gives another and another, and by the time the scarlet fever runs its course the patient becomes dreadfully sick, ends up with ear troubles, enlarged glands and sometimes kidney affections.
When it runs into car troubles and enlarged glands of the neck this is one of the several remedies to be studied.
"Paralysis of the tongue in old people. Weakness of the tongue in old people. Hardness of the tongue in old people."
Premature old age and giving out of muscles. There is a catarrhal state in this remedy, an accumulation of mucus, in the nose, throat, larynx and trachea. It is very suitable for old, people who have rattling in the trachea.
On every cold change of the weather, and on every exposure to the cold, he gets an additional aggravation of the rattling. Rattling respiration. There are a few remedies that have, in such high degree, this coarse rattling in the chest of old people, that it is well to emphasize it.
Baryta carb. is one of them. Senega, Ammoniacum and Baryta muriatica should be compared. When there is coarse rattling in the chest all the time in an old person, an octogenarian, who is pretty comfortable in summer, but miserable all winter from the coarse rattling in the chest, and there are no other symptoms, Ammoniacum will keep him comfortable.
Throat: The sore throat in this remedy has numerous symptoms. "Inflammation of cellular tissue of fauces and tonsils."
This remedy is one in general catarrhal symptoms of the throat. Granulations of the throat, so that the pharynx looks shiny, studded with coarse granules becoming inflamed with every cold spell, or from being chilled.
Every cold change inflames the tonsils, and in children they very soon enlarge. Children with enlarged tonsils, and with enlarged glands in other places, somewhat dwarfish intellectually, slow to learn, Baryta carb. will cure the enlarged tonsils.
But these, you see, are constitutional symptoms. You are not selecting the remedy purely on enlarged tonsils.
"Inflammation of the tonsils."
The inflammation not so violent as that which comes in Bell, it does not come on in a night, it does not go on rapidly to suppuration; but it is a very sore throat, has come on slowly after many days of exposure and there is gradual growth and gradual development.
That is the character of the Baryta carb. tonsillitis; while that of Bell. comes on with great rapidity. Hepar is also rapid and goes on to suppuration. There is a remedy for inflammation of the tonsils where the ear is involved and is ameliorated by heat, that very few use, but it is of great value; it is Chamomilla, and it is
especially indicated if the patient is irritable.
The pain is ameliorated by heat and comes on with great violence. It might be mistaken for a Bell. inflammation, but Cham. cures it permanently.
"Sensation of plug in the throat;" that is, the tonsils are so large they feel like a great ball or great lump in the throat.
They change the character of the voice, cause difficulty.
"Much burning in the throat. Inability to swallow anything but liquids."
This irritation keeps up a constant choking and spasmodic constriction in the throat; contractions, and drawings, and crampings in the throat.
It also has a spasm in the oesophagus when swallowing, especially in old nervous, or prematurely broken- down people.
"Spasm in the oesophagus. Difficulty in swallowing."
The bolus of food goes down a little way, and then causes spasms, and he gags and chokes. This gagging and choking with a little food is a very strong feature in Kali c., Graph. and Merc. cor.
This is also a strong feature of Baryta carb., but much stronger in Merc cor.
The troubles of eating and drinking and appetite and stomach can all be run together.
Stomach and abdomen: There is weakness of digestion, all sorts of disorders and disagreeable sensations in the stomach after eating. Sometimes gastralgia; sometimes distension.
"Stomach aches after eating." Extreme weakness after eating. Abdomen hard and tense. "Mesenteric glands swollen and hard; with a big belly; abdominal muscles sore to touch."
It has cured, in the early stages, tabes mesenterica. It has cured the enlarged abdomen of children, when there was emaciation of the limbs, emaciation everywhere, knots of enlarged glands and a dwarfed intellect.
Baryta carb. has an inveterate constipation. "Difficult knotty stools. Stool hard, and insufficient."
A lack of action in the rectum, and hemorrhoidal protrusion during stool and urination.
Genitals male: Of the male sexual organs we have some strange features. This medicine takes away all sexual desire and ability, leaving the genitals relaxed, and in a state of impotency.
"Relaxed penis. Impotence. Diminished sexual desire. Hypertrophied prostate. Atrophied testicles."
It cures old gleety discharge from the urethra. An old, painless, whitish, gleety discharge that has been in existence a long time. It is an offensive discharge and there is no inflammation.
"Numbness of the genitals."
Genitals female: The female has many troubles. Sterility. Dwindling of the ovary. Dwindling of the mammary glands, and yet the lymphatics become enlarged and infiltrated.
A passive leucorrhoeal discharge, whitish, thick, persistent, often copious, worse about a week before the menstrual period.
Larynx: With some a constitutional weakness takes hold of the larynx; a paralytic weakness. Voice entirely lost.
Or, "hoarseness and huskiness.”
Low, deep voice. Aphonia from constitutional weakness, and from paralysis. Feeling in the larynx all the time as if inhaling smoke, or pitch, or sulphur fumes, or dust.
With the hoarseness there is a chronic dry, hoarse, barking cough; not a hard cough, but it comes every night. Suffocative cough of old people.
It says here, "impending paralysis of the lungs."
Chest and cough: That is in keeping with the general nature of the remedy. Chest full of mucus, but unable to expectorate it.
You observe from the effort made in the cough that there is a weakness somewhere, a lack of power. It is not a strong effort.
"Night cough, with asthmatic breathing."
Cough excited by irritation in the larynx and trachea. There is a cough in Baryta carb. where he coughs and coughs, and gets no relief until be lies on the abdomen; and so long as he lies on the abdomen he is free from cough.
Palpitation from slight exertion when lying on the left side when thinking about it, with anxiety and orgasm of blood, with strong pulsation in the head, rapid pulse. Palpitation in chlorotic girls.
Tension in the muscles of the back. Swelling of the glands of the back of the neck. " Swelling of the cervical glands. Fatty tumors upon the back."
A number of times a patient has said,
"Doctor, did you intend to take away that fatty tumor I had on my back?
The chances are I did not know he had one. That is generally, the way such things appear in the practice of the homoeopathic physician, for he does not prescribe for the tumor, and the chances are he thinks little about the tumor in his prescription; he gives the constitutional medicine, and they often disappear after a while, and then the patient thinks the doctor has done a wonderful thing.
He gets more glory and more credit for curing a wart than he does for curing the patient. The doctor who prescribes correctly turns the vital state into order.
He cures the patient, and the patient, being in a state of order, commences to repair his body, and the tissues go through a general house cleaning and such things as are not needed are dispensed with; and the physician is considered a wonderful man.
So this remedy cures tumors and warts. Warts upon the limbs, and upon the back, and upon the hands.
The pains are of a gouty, rheumatic character, worse from becoming cold and from cold weather. Paralytic weakness and trembling and numbness of the feet.
Offensive perspiration of the feet which causes soreness of the soles, ulcers on the feet, checked foot sweat. Trembling of the feet while standing and tottering while walking. Tearing, drawing pains in lower limbs. Sudden sharp pains in knees.
Baryta Muriatica
Generalities: This is one of our deep acting constitutional remedies and one much neglected. It was much used by the earlier men in our school with great effect. In mental weakness, insanity, enlarged glands and sexual excitement we have a group of symptoms hard to cure without Baryta muriatica.
Add to this profound increasing muscular weakness and we must have this remedy sometime during the case or the cure will be slow.
Its complaints are prominent in the morning, forenoon, afternoon, evening, night and after midnight. In the diseases most amenable to this remedy are the affection of the lymphatic glands and other glands.

Belladonna
Generalities and modalities: Belladonna is a remedy that takes hold of the system with great violence. It is especially suitable to plethoric, vigorous individual, and intellectual people brainy people have complaints coming on suddenly, providing they are in a substantial state of health, and are reasonably plethoric and vascular.
The complaints of Belladonna come on suddenly, run a regular course, and subside suddenly. The pains and suffering come on suddenly and with great violence, and subside suddenly.
Colds ultimate rapidly, run a sharp course, a course of great violence, and subside sudden. Belladonna especially affects the whole vascular system, the heart, lungs, brain and nervous system.
Among the earliest conditions to examine is the heat. It has inflammations of all the organs, especially the brain, lungs, and liver.
The intestines are also involved as well as the other organs. These inflammations are always attended by violent heat; the heat is some thing unusual.
It is more marked in Belladonna than in almost any other remedy. When you put your hand upon a Belladonna subject you will suddenly withdraw it, the heat is so intense.
The memory of the heat is carried in the hand and fingers for some time.
Pains, inflammations, and sufferings, nightly attacks of delirium, violent attacks inflammatory in character are attended with that kind of heat.
No matter where the inflammation is, there is that same intense heat, There are times, though, when that kind of heat is present, and it is not Bell., and that is when the fever is of the continued type.
Fever: Bell. has no continued fever in it. It is true the older books tell you about Bell. for this violent heat in typhoid and some other continued fevers, but if you examine Bell. from beginning to end you will find nothing continued in its fever.
Its fever is remittent. It never comes on in its complaints gradually like typhoid. It has not the gradual rise and the gradual fall like a continued fever.
I only mention that so that you will not be lost.
Our lamented Hering, one of the ablest teachers the world ever had, classes Bell. for typhoid fever when the delirium and the heat are somewhat like Bell., but let me tell you just what will take place.
When you give Bell. for the delirium in typhoid fever - for such a delirium as looks like Bell. - you may subdue the delirium, but other manifestations will rise in that fever.
You will not subdue the fever, but you will subdue the patient. The patient will be sick longer, will go into a greater state of prostration than if you had let that delirium alone.
But Stramonium fits perfectly Hering's description of a case in which he says Bell. should be given. The idea of that heat must be well fixed in the mind.
Heat, intense heat, violent heat.
There is another phase of Bell. that runs all through these inflammatory complaints and its fevers.
The inflamed parts, and very commonly the skin, are very red, and, as the inflammation advances, grow dusky; as the fever advances the face becomes mottled; but the first representation of Bell. is bright red, and the skin is shiny.
An inflamed part than can be seen will be red. In inflammation of glands the skin over the glands will be bright red in spots.
Hence red spots in the neck over inflamed glands. Inflammation of the parotid glands, inflammation of the sub-maxillary glands, inflammation of the glands of the neck, there will be a spot as red as fire over each.
The throat is as red as scarlet. The mucus membrane is inflamed, and red as scarlet. After a little it grows dusky, finally mottled; showing the character and direction of the Bell. constitution.
It travels gradually towards a zymotic state, such as we see in scarlet fever, in low inflammatory conditions; at first intense congestion, but vaso-motor paralysis follows.
Intense congestion and blueness, or purple and mottled.
Burning: Another grand feature of Bell. is present in its inflamed parts, and in its painful parts, whenever Bell. brings out anything like a decided action, it has burning; intense burning.
The burning in the throat with a Bell. sore throat is like a coal of fire. Inflammation of the tonsils, burning like fire.
The skin burns, and it is burning hot to the sensation of the patient, and intensely hot to the doctor. The skin burns in scarlet fever. He says,
"It burns so, doctor, it burns so;"
in bilious or remittent fever. In inflammation of an organ, the skin burns, there is a burning fever, and the part itself burns.
Inflammation of the bladder, with burning. Congestion of the brain, and the head burns. Congestion of the throat, and the throat burns.
It is hot locally, and it also burns subjectively. In gastritis there is burning.
In inflammation of the liver, the liver burns. Congestion of the liver with jaundice, and the liver burns. Now, we have three leading features; do not call them "key notes," for that is not what I mean; heat, redness and burning.
We will see how they modify the whole feature of the sickness, how they permeate and ramify, and how they take meaning.
Swelling: But, that is not all. We have much swelling in Bell. The inflamed parts swell rapidly; are extremely sensitive to touch; are very painful, with the sensation as if they would burst, with pressive pains, stinging and burning.
There is heat, redness and burning in these inflamed parts, as well as swelling. Swelling, stinging, burning, throbbing. All over he throbs with all congestions and inflammations he throbs.
The part itself throbs, and his carotids throb. When children are sick in bed with congestion of the brain, they have an intensely hot head. If old enough to talk about it, they will say "it burns."
But then we will notice the throbbing. The temporal arteries and the carotids pulsate, with great violence. A turmoil is going on. An earthquake is taking place. Everything is being shaken when the patient needs Bell.
It is one of the most painful of remedies. It is so sensitive to pain. So sensitive that be suffers more than ordinary people do from the pain.
And, remember, the pains comes suddenly, they remain longer or shorter, and they go suddenly. They do this in neuralgia; they do this in inflammatory conditions, they do it in inflamed organs; they do it wherever they come.
Pains, tear, shoot, burn, and sting, and press, and smart, all at once. All of these characteristics are bundled up into one bundle, so that he suffers.
All of his pains are worse from motion, worse from light, worse from a jar, worse from cold. He wants to be wrapped up warmly, and is worse from any exposure or a draft.
The headaches are like many of die other pains; it feels as if the brain was going up and down, tearing and burning at every step he takes, and from every motion of the eyes, or turning the eyeballs, or going up stairs, rising from, his seat, or sitting down; all motion creates violent pains; feels as if the head would burst, as if the eyes would be pressed out. If he moves he starts the heart to pulsate on his sore parts and he calls them "hammering pains."
Wherever that pain is he cannot have it touched. If it is touched it will throb. If uncovered it will become worse. If some one walks across the floor, the jar makes him worse.
The jar of the bed, if he is in bed, is a common aggravation of Bell. If he is so sick that he is in bed, the jar of the bed makes all of his complaints worse.
You go to the bedside of a patient suffering from, an inflamed liver, and he will not let you put your hand on the bed, for the jar makes him worse. If the pain is in the abdomen; if it is an inflamed uterus; if it is in confinement, it is the same.
This aggravation from the jar is such a marked feature that it is not always confined to inflammations. It is often a modified in a state of nervous hyperesthesia.
A woman in confinement, when there is no inflammation, and none threatening, is in such a state of hyperesthesia that she wants the windows closed to keep the air out; she does not want to be touched; she does not want the bed moved, any little jar aggravates; she is so sensitive to a jar, even when there is no sensitive part.
You go to such a case, and you will realize in time that you are going to have a difficult and painful labor, without Bell.
But with a dose of Bell. all of these complaints pass away quickly, so quick is the action of this medicine. The jar of the bed will often reveal to you the nature of the remedy. If you walk to the bedside of a patient suffering from gallstone colic, with violent pains, he cannot have the bed touched.
His face is red, his skin burns, he cannot be touched, he is in excruciating, agony, and he tells that before you have crossed the room, You see it all. He says,
"Don't touch the bed, doctor."
That is a special feature; the aggravation from a jar is marked.
Spasms: general spasms and local spasms. Spasms of little canals, of the circular fibers, of tubular organs, like that I have spoken of in the gallstone colic.
In the ductus communis choledochus there is a clutching - or it may be in the cystic duct that the circular fibers, clutch that little bit of stone and will not let it through.
The passage is large enough to admit it and it has started to go through - but the irritation of the part causes a spasm and it clutches, that little stone; you put a dose of Bell. on his tongue, the spasm lets up, stone passes on, and there is no more trouble; in fifteen minutes the gallstone colic is gone.
There is never a failure in homoeopathic prescribing in gallstone- colic. The symptoms are not always Bell., but in this instance, where that horrible sensitiveness is present, it is Bell.
"Convulsions in infants."
They are violent and are usually associated with cerebral congestion. The skin is always in a state of fever. They are brought on from light, from a draft of cold air, from the infant becoming cold.
Nervous, brainy children, those with a good sized head, and plump, large-headed boys; boys especially, but also girls that have boys' heads, when exposed to the cold have convulsions. Light, motion and cold will bring on these convulsion.
The Bell. subject as an individual, like Bry., is worse in all his complaints from motion.
Motion brings on convulsions, motion brings on pain; motion increases the action of the heart and brings on throbbing; motion brings on many complaints and increases the sufferings.
Now think of these generals whenever you come to Bell. This idea of Bell. must prevail. No matter how many little symptoms you accumulate, get at these first.
Mind: The mental symptoms of Bell. are delightful to study, but dreadful to look upon. The mental symptoms are such as come on in intense fevers, such as are observed in maniacal excitement, in delirium.
Excitement runs all through. Violence runs all through the mental symptoms. The mental symptoms are all active, never passive. There is no passive delirium in Bell. It is a wild state.
He is wild; striking, biting, tearing things; doing unusual things; doing strange things; doing unexpected things. He is in a state of excitability. These mental symptoms that come on during fevers, the delirium and excitement, are very commonly ameliorated by eating a little light food.
That is not generally known in Bell., but it is quite a strong feature. But remember the violence, and with it, if you go to the bedside where there is this violent delirium, keep in mind the heat, redness and burning.
Full of imaginations. Sees ghosts, and spirits, and officers, and wild things. In the early part of the fever the delirium is very violent and excitable; but as it passes on he goes into a sleep, a sort of half-slumber a semi- comatose state.
Apparently in a dream, and he screams out. Dreams horrible things. Sees in his dreams the things that he talks about. When he has real sleep, or resting, as near as it is for him to rest, he has violent dreams; night- mare.
Sees things on fire. He is in a delirium, and in torment. He becomes stupid at times, appears to lose consciousness. Loses the memory of all things and then becomes wild. His delirium goes ort when he appears to be sleeping.
These symptoms often occur with cerebral congestion, the violent cerebral congestion of the infant. If they are old enough to talk they will talk about the hammering in the head.
In Bell. the infant also commonly remains in a profound stupor, the profound stupor that goes with congestion of the brain pupils dilated; skin hot and dry; face red, throbbing carotids.
Finally the child becomes pale as the stupor increases and the neck is drawn back, because as it progresses the base of the brain and spine become involved, and the muscles of the neck contract; drawing the head - backwards; and he rolls the head; eyes staring, pupils dilated.
This mental state is associated with scarlet fever and with cerebro-spinal meningitis. Again, these mental states take the form of acute mania, when the patient will bite the spoon; will bark like a dog; will do all sorts of violent things; even jump out of the window. He has to be restrained, put ina
strait-jacket.
The face is red, and the skin is hot, and the patient at times says that he burns all over, or that the head burns, and the head is very hot.
During all this time the feet are cold. Head hot, feet cold, or feet and hands cold as ice. It seems all the blood is being hurried to the head. All sorts of delusions and hallucinations are mingled with the acute mania; ghosts; horrid monsters; strange things, and deformed subjects.
Fear of imaginary things, and wants to run away. In the delirium of Bell. he wants to jump out of the window, wants to run, wants to get away from his attendants. He thinks they are doing him injury.
Throughout the acute mania, and throughout the delirious state, all the manifestations partake of violence. Destructiveness.
The Bell. patient in the most acute state must be watched, controlled, handled, and sometimes tied. In the text it describes these states as "rage, fury."
He wants to do violence.
"Moaning. Instead of eating, bit wooden spoon in two, gnawed plate, and growled and barked like a dog. A boy violently sick ran around the room laughing immoderately."
It has an insane laughter. A loud, boisterous laughter.
"A piece of bread, which he took to be a stone, he threw far from him. He turns and rolls in bed in a perfect rage. Aversion to noise and company."
Aversion to light; is better in the dark. At times a more passive state intervenes between these attacks of violence.
The active time is always that of violence; but there is sometimes a more passive state when the patient will sit or lie in bed and tear the bed clothing, or break anything that she can get her hands on. If it is a stick, she will break it up.
Running all through the complaints, whether delirium, fever, or pains, there is starting.
Starting in sleep like an electric shock. just as soon as he falls asleep a sensation like an electric shock throughout the body.
"Starts in fright at approach of others. Fear of imaginary things, wants to run away from them." "Great anxiety"
runs through the remedy. As a patient comes out of these attacks of delirium, as he comes out of convulsions, fear is depicted upon the face.
The patient is in great excitement; the circulation is in a state of great excitement; the heart is in great excitement; motion and emotion increase the beating of the heart.
It may have been gleaned that Bell. is a remedy that is over sensitive; a state of hyperesthesia extreme irritability of tissues. This is said to be an increased irritability of the nerve centres.
This develops a state of increased ability to taste, and to smell and to feel; excibility of the sensorium.
Sensorium: Sensitive to impressions. Sensitive to light, to noise, to touch, to jar. The sensorium is violently excited.
Excessive nervous irritability stands out, perhaps, as one of the most prominent features of Bell. in contrast with medicines like Opium that deprive the patient of all sensitivity.
The more congestion there is in Bell. the more excitability. The more congestion there is in Opium the less excitability.
And yet they are very similar in many respects; very similar in aspect; in the appearance of the eyes and face; similar in pathological states. If I were to prescribe on the pathological state, the congestion of the brain, the appearance, without taking in the intensity of the one or other, I would not be able to distinguish between Opium and Bell.
They often antidote each other. But we do not prescribe on pathology, but upon symptoms, after careful individualization.
"Vertigo," with this intense excitability. Turning in bed, or moving the head makes him dizzy. "Things go round." "Vertigo with pulsations."
Moving the head increases the pulsation, and the vertigo. The patient lies in bed; cannot hold the head up.
This increase sensitiveness especially applies to the scalp. We notice it particularly in the woman. She cannot have the hair bound up. It is often the case that Bell. patients will not have the hair combed or brushed.
"Lets the hair hang down the back;" so sensitive is the scalp. "Hair feels as if pulled. Does not want the hair touched."
There are some remedies that correspond to extreme irritation in very sensitive natures; like Hepar, where she faints with the pain; like Nitric acid, when cannot bear the noise of vehicles going along the street, because it creates such violent sufferings; like Coffea, where footsteps aggravate all the complaints; he was so sensitive to pain that the noise of one entering the door when he was on the third floor aggravated his sufferings intensely, though no one else could hear it.
In Nux vomica, even the sound of footsteps increases the pain all over the body. Bell. has in its nature all this sensitiveness to pain. It is a part of the general sensorium; the who bodily state is intensified.
The Chamomilla patient is oversensitive to pain, but we do not need to sympathize with the Chamomilla patient, he will fight it out himself. But you will pity the Belladonna patient, you will pity the Pulsatilla patient, and the Nitric acid patient.
A strange part of it also is the reactive excitability. The reaction to medicine is so quick and so sudden that I have many times heard a patient say, before I had turned my back away from the bed,
"That medicine has relieved me,” so quick is the reaction.
In many medicines reaction is slowed down, but in Bell. it is intensified. So it is in Nux vomica and in Zincum. When the case is very acute, but sometimes also when the case is somewhat chronic, this sensibility is marked.
Cuprum is so sensitive all over. It has sensitive warts; it has sensitive skin, sensitive polypi, everything sensitive; and it is so sensitive in its reaction that, when it is needed, partially indicated remedies will not work, because the patient is so oversensitive to everything that everything overacts.
The smallest dose, the mildest dose, the simplest dose overacts and everything aggravates. Odors aggravate; well selected remedies disturb instead of cure.
Cuprum tones down, relieves that sensitivity, and well-selected remedies will then act curatively and long. Cuprum lacks it in that high state of congestion - it is not like Bell. in that; Cuprum does not have that sensibility along with the active fever and congestion, the throbbing and disturbance of the circulation; but it has it in a chronic state.
Women and children are so sensitive that they get no sympathy and it is not suitable for hysterical ones either, but those that are not able to control themselves perfectly. Such is Cuprum.
We have medicines that are suitable to sensitive people, and especially sensitive women. Sensitive to odors, sensitive to every conceivable influence.
The doctor who will go out and take care of these poor sick little mortals, who understands their nature, perceives their quality, and relieves them of their suffering will command the whole community, in spite of the reputation of all the doctors that are there before him.
He must not be one who measures everybody by his own sensorium he may be a pachyderm, but he will find patients that are sensitive.
Head:This sensitivity is present in most of the Bell. headaches. There are stabbing pains, throbbing pains, shooting pains, all in connection with congestion.
They are all sensitive to motion, to every jar, to light, even to the winking of the eyes; sensitive to draft. Bell. will be indicated when the head is rolling - the patient rolling the head because the pain is so severe he cannot keep still, although the motion increases the headache.
A child lies and turns and tosses its head with congestion of the brain, screaming out with the brain cry, a
sudden shriek. After awhile it wakes up and commences to toss the head, and every few minutes it shrieks with that brain cry; it is going into a stupor, the neck is drawn back, the face is flushed, it is now becoming pale.
There are times of stupor, and in that stupor the child cries out. In all brain troubles we must be careful about feeding much, or overloading the stomach, because the stomach is very feeble. It will not digest much, but the food should be well selected and light.
Great heaviness of the head. The head feels like a weight, and is drawn back. Sometimes we see the head drawn back from contraction of the muscles of the neck when the membranes of the upper portion of the spine are involved.
Again, we see the Bell. patient drawing the head back himself, because drawing the head back often ameliorates the violent headaches.
This amelioration is kept up so long as he holds the head back. Aggravated from bending the head forward when sitting, from bending the head forward when standing, or stooping. It feels as if the brain would fall out or push forward.
This in creases the headache so much that it sometimes turns into knife-like, or hammering pains. These are the expressions used.
Sensation of nails and hammers, jagging and tearing; but with all, pressure and throbbing. When rising from a seat these sensations are all intensified. Throbbing pulsation, like hammers hitting the inside of the sore skull, described by patients as if the inside of the skull was one continuous sore and was being pecked by hammers with every pulsation.
Some times it will settle down while sitting still, or while lying; but rising up from a chair will set that hammer going.
"Expansive" is an expression that is often used by the patient, and it was used by the provers. Expansive sensation, as if the head was enlarged; pressure from within out.
All these headaches are relieved by pressure upon the outside. Sudden touch or pressure will aggravate; but pressure that is gradually increased and brought to bear carefully upon the head will ameliorate, like the pressure of a bandage, or a tight-fitting cap.
Again, all of these headaches are brought on by exposure to the cold air; from standing in the cold air with the head uncovered. Sometimes a severe headache will come on from merely having the hair cut. Congestion of the head lasts for days, with throbbing and pulsating; from having the hair cut.
Ear troubles, chest complaints, rheumatic complaints come on from having the hair cut, or from standing in the cool air with the hat off; so sensitive is the head to cold.
It may be said of this remedy that complaints of various parts of the body come through the head and go downwards, Complaints in the lower extremities, rheumatic complaints of the joints, with great redness and swelling, come on from uncovering the head, from exposure of the head, or from getting the head wet, or from being caught in a shower.
There is one complaint which will puzzle you if you ever meet it and you do not know just what I am going to tell you.
The complaints of Bell. in a general way are ameliorated from rest, and aggravated from motion; but there is a kind of restlessness with tearing pain from the hips down, most troublesome to observe, that keeps the patient walking all of the time.
The instant there is rest the pains come on. They sometimes shoot downwards, they sometimes tear up and down the nerves; and this comes on from exposure of the head, and not from getting the feet wet.
Complaints of Aconit and Pulsatilla come on from getting the feet wet, and these complaints rise upwards, come on through the feet and go upwards and affect the head.
Bell. complaints come on from exposure of the head and go downwards; sometimes affect the head sometimes the chest sometimes the stomach, sometimes centre in the abdomen, sometimes centre in the uterus and ovaries.
Rhus has complaints from getting wet, but the complaints are in the parts that are wet. If he gets the legs wet he will have rheumatism in the legs.
There is a vast distinction, and this distinction has to be made in almost every prescription you will make. Homoeopathy is a matter of individualization as to how complaints spread. Some complaints begin on the right side of the body and spread to the left.
Some complaints begin in the top of the body and go downwards. That is the way this remedy acts. In some remedies the exposure of the feet to an ice cold draft mill bring on headache (Silic.); but in Bell, the exposure will bring on a headache, or neuralgia of the lower extremities.
Now that pain that comes on from rest is an exception in Bell. That illustrates again the importance of distinguishing very decidedly between generals and particulars.
Without knowing "Generals" and "Particulars" you will never do accurate prescribing. The lower extremities here are the particulars. The patient and the general condition of the patient are ameliorated by rest; the symptoms of the patient are ameliorated by rest.
All of those symptoms that can be predicted of the patient himself are ameliorated by rest, but the pains of the lower limbs, as described, those neuralgic pains are ameliorated by motion, and come on in rest.
That does not mean that all the pains in the lower extremities are ameliorated by motion, because the pains in rheumatism are invariably ameliorated by rest, and aggravated by motion.
Those tearing pains, from the hips downwards, with no swelling, come on during rest. All remedies are full of freaks, and it is the figuring out of these peculiarities that enables us to do good prescribing.
With all the complaints of Bell. do not lose sight of the congestion upwards.
"Rush of blood to the head. Cold extremities."
Cold feet, cold hands; hot head.
Eyes: Inflammatory conditions of the eyes.
"Glistening eyes. Dilated pupils. Flushed face. Intense redness of the inflamed part."
Inflammation of all the tissues of the eyes, the lids, and all the parts of the eyeball, with most violent pain. Heat, redness, and burning.
These three strong features that run through the remedy will be found in the eye sufferings. Pulsation, tumefaction, lachrymation; intense pains; sufferings all worse from motion, and worse from light.
Most intense photophobia.
"Flashes of light and flickerings before the eyes,"
When reading, lines appear crooked.
"Dimness of vision, or actual blindness.”
Intense congestion and fullness of all the parts.
"Apoplexy of the retina. Half-opened, protruding, staring eyes."
You will see that in the infant when the child lies in a stupor; eyes half open; congestion of the brain; face flushed and intensely hot; rolling the head from side to side; if it has been going on for several days the face will - later become pallid, and the neck drawn back.
In these congestive troubles, lying with the eyes half open; almost no winking.
"Orbital neuralgias. Protruding eyes, with dilated pupils. Inflammation of the optic nerve and retina. Eyes congested and red."
Another feature belonging to the eye is strabismus. Not those cases coming on gradually, such as will, need the surgeon, but those that come on with congestion of the brain, with this state of congestion and dilated pupils and rolling the head from side to side, flushed face, throbbing carotids and intense heat.
After a day or two the eye begins to turn in, and the little one is cross-eyed. That is an additional indication for Bell. Sometimes, coming out of a severe congestion, the strabismus remains and Bell. is sometimes the suitable remedy.
All of these cases coming on from the circulatory, conditions should be cured with remedies. They should never be sent to the surgeon. Though they remain some time, even months, they will be cured by well- selected remedies, while those that come on gradually, and those that are born so, will not be relieved by remedies.
Only those spasmodic ones mat are associated with, and come on from, congestion of the brain. In connection with congestion of the liver and duodenal catarrh there is yellowisness in the eyes.
Ears: In inflammations of the ear which go on to suppuration Bell. is rarely useful. We have to look to deep acting remedies.
We may have the pain, tenderness, over sensitiveness, all inflammatory conditions; but cases requiring Bell. rarely go on to suppuration.
Mucous: Now we come to the mucous membranes, the nose, mouth, throat, larynx, chest, the mucous membrane extending into the car through the Eustachian tube, and we have another strong feature of Bell. which characterizes most of its conditions.
Great dryness; a sensation of dryness.
Dryness in the nose; mouth; of the tongue; in the throat; in the chest, and such evidences as dry cough and spasmodic conditions.
These are so general. that with the nose symptoms, the coryza, the throat symptoms, the cough, this is intensified; dryness of mucous membranes will generally be found. It is that way with Phos.
When Phos. has a sore throat it will have dryness of the mouth, tongue and air passages. This is general as to the respiratory tract. Then there is coryza with much sneezing, "Pricking, burning in the nose."
Hot sensation in the nose. The general states present Much redness of the face, much heat with the coryza; hot head, cold extremities; marked headache, because there is dryness.
The very dryness itself is sometimes causative of pain, because the natural flow from the mucous membranes is dried up.
Whenever we have checked secretions we have fever, and in Bell. this is marked. Checking of the discharge with fever, with heat, redness and burning; red face, burning face; heat in the face and head, and cold extremities. It says in the text,
"maddening headache, with suppressed catarrh."
Now, in such a climate as this most people during winter and cold weather and the changes have more or less mucous flow from the nose, and eyes, and air passages.
They are better when this takes place. All at once it stops, and all the parts become dry; then look out.
An awful, maddening, throbbing headache comes on. It is not so suitable for those old catarrhs where there is a copious flow of thick, yellow mucus.
The catarrhal state wherein Bell. is useful is simply the exaggeration of the whitish mucous flow. Where it has been thick and yellow, and then stops suddenly from a cold, and a coryza comes on, Bell. is worthless.
Always bear in mind that you select for suppressed catarrh a medicine that is within the sphere of the symptoms that have been suppressed. Hence, the medicine for thick, yellowish-green discharges might be Merc., Sulphur, or Pulsatilla; then you are within the range of medicines capable of re-establishing the flow, and at the same time beginning a curative effect on the state of the tissue, leaving the patient in a much better state.
Face: Violent faceaches. Rending, tearing pains in the face; throbbing pains in the face. Pains in the face worse on the right side; worse from a jar; with much heat; throbbing carotids; hot head; brought on from exposure to cold wind, and riding in the cold wind.
Bell. has cured paralytic conditions, but Causticum is generally the remedy for paralysis of the face from riding in a cold wind. Spasms of the muscles of the face.
Extraordinary twitchings of the face. Erysipelas in the face; a bright red gradually becoming purple if there is a fever accompanying it. In the neuralgic pains there is always more or less congestion of the face with violent pains, and the face will be bright red.
With the zymotic state, as the febrile condition becomes more profound, and as the blood becomes more zymotic, the face grows from duskiness into a mottled state, as you will see in Baptisia, more marked in Baptisia than in Bell.
"Red face, with burning heat."
The teeth are full of pains, congestions, and aches of a similar character. Very sensitive teeth.
The tongue should be a dry tongue, as that is general with its mucous membranes. Dry mouth; dry tongue; swollen tongue; protruding tongue, dry and hard, feels like leather.
Loss of sensation, loss of taste, loss of power of the tongue and loss of speech are all Bell. features. "Paralytic weakness of the tongue; trembling of the tongue when it is protruded."
It comes out weak, In a very few days the Bell. fever patient is greatly reduced, is greatly exhausted, has almost a paralytic weakness.
When he raises the hand and holds it a moment it trembles in the same way.
That which is found in the tongue is only a part of the general state. Trembling from congestion of the nerve centers. The papillae of the tongue are erect, and the tongue is bright red. Bright red tongue in scarlet fever. Bright red tongue in congestion of the brain, with the erect papillae.
When going over Arum triphyllum I told you it had been pronounced "strawberry tongue." It is the same with Bell. The tongue looks as red as a strawberry, and the papillae stick up like seeds.
"Red streak in the middle of the tongue, wide and broader towards the point. Tongue, white centre with red edges."
White tongue with brain affections is not uncommon. It has thick, milk-white, delicate fur all over the tongue in brain troubles.
"Dryness of the mouth, with thirst."
"Dryness of the mouth, with no thirst."
Bell. is full of thirst, we will find when we come to study the stomach symptoms.
Stomach: Sometimes Bell. wants large quantities, sometimes water constantly to wet the mouth, like Ars.
It is acommon feature in Bell., like Ars., to want water little and often, just enough to wet his parched tongue, mouth and throat.
Dryness in posterior nares, and the mucus that he drags down from the posterior nares is tough and stringy, and very scanty, and it is white, or, if changed at all from white, it is bloody.
Yet I have not said anything about this remedy for bloody discharges and for bleeding. We will find before we finish that it is a haemorrhagic remedy, that parts bleed easily.
There is bleeding from the eyes, bleeding from the nose, bleeding from the throat, bleeding from the larynx, bleeding from the chest, bleeding from the bladder, bleeding from the uterus.
Ulcers bleed. Little fine ulcers in the throat no bigger than a pinhead. Little aphthous patches bleed. An aphthous inflammation of the throat; but the most of the complaints of the throat are dry and red.
Great tumefaction. Extremely sensitive; much swelling; inability to swallow. Great pain on swallowing, with all the sensitivity of the surrounding parts, with the sore throat, and with the inflamed throat.
Inflammation and swelling of the tonsils, with red face, intense heat, throbbing carotids, high fever, coming on from cold. Fauces and pharynx deep red. Soft palate and tonsils swollen.
Swallowing painful, particularly of fluids. Speech thick.
"Feels like a lump in the throat" that is from the swollen tonsils.
Constant scraping and hawking in the throat. The pharynx and larynx are very commonly in a state of spasm; partly from dryness, partly from extreme sensitiveness of the nerves of the part. Clutching of the throat on going to sleep, clutching of throat on coughing. Spasms of the oesophagus.
"Spasmodic constriction of the throat." Constrictions that are spasmodic.
Constrictions of the larynx, of the pharynx, of the throat. Bell. has constructive pains in parts that feel like the clutch of fingers. That sensation of clutching is felt in the uterus; it is a spasm. It is felt, in the liver; it is felt in the brain; it is felt in the throat. Jerking and twitching of muscles, with violent pain, in painful parts.
That is a strong Bell. feature. Patients sometimes in their inability to describe their feelings will say, "Doctor, I feel a clutching in there."
This constriction that comes in the sore throat occurs just in the act of swallowing fluids or solids, and that action will force the food and fluids up into the nose, and sometimes out of the nose.
Some remedies have it as a paralytic condition, because the muscles of deglutition are paralyzed and they do not favor the natural contracting actions to force the food down the oesophagus, and in that way the food is forced up into the nose and causes strangling.
In Bell., in its acute states, its inflammatory conditions and its spasms would distinguish it from Lachesis, where it occurs as a paralytic condition after diphtheria, and from Alumina, which has a spasm of the
oesophagus.
These are slow in coming on Bell. is early. The early part of the fever is the time of its irritation. The latter part of the fever is the time of its relaxation. Rapidly forming aphthous patches upon the tonsils.
With the sore throat such as we have described you will nearly always find an enlargement and inflammation, or soreness of the glands, under the jaws about the neck. Tenderness along with a Belladonna sore throat is a natural concomitant.
A strange feature running through the Bell. fevers of all sorts is an unconquerable craving for lemons, and lemon-juice. Lemonade seems to agree sometimes. In acute diseases when they crave lemon it is good for
them.
They often crave things to eat. You must not be so violently temperate and in favor of prohibition that if a patient longs for beer in acute sufferings you will not give it.
"Thirst for water changed into thirst for beer." Thirst for things that could not be endorsed in health, even. "Excessive thirst for cold water."
In the stomach and bowels we have inflammatory conditions which can all be grouped as one. Pain, burning, distress, distension; sensitive to a jar, and to the slightest motion, and to the slightest pressure.
Sensitive to a jar, and sensitive to motion. "Pain in the stomach extending through to the spine."
Inflammation of the stomach from becoming chilled, with intense heat; with much burning. It has violent colic, intense cramping pain in children. Face red and hot; pain relieved only by bending forward.
There are exceptional in stances where it has been relieved by bending backward, when it is similar to Dioscorea. The mother finds that by holding the child on her hand it will relieve the colic.
That is like Colocynth; but Colocynth is without much fever, without much thirst, a pain in one spot, an intense colic in the abdomen ameliorated by doubling up, ameliorated by bending across something hard, is Colocynth.
In that instance Colocynth can be prescribed on that one group of symptoms.
"Great pain in the ileo-coecal region; cannot bear the slightest touch, even the bed clothes."
There are instances where Bell. is the remedy in appendicitis.
Stools: Belladonna has dysenteric troubles. Diarrhoea, with scanty fluid stool; marked straining, but with it the face is flushed.
Heat, redness and burning in the face and head. Cold extremities, with hot head. Much straining, but passes scanty stool.
"Spasmodic constriction of sphincter ani; with hemorrhoids."
Hemorrhoids that are violently painful, that are intensely red, that are greatly swollen and inflamed, a high grade of inflammation; cannot be touched; must lie with limbs wide apart, the hemorrhoids are painful and there is much burning.
Bladder: No remedy has a greater irritation in the bladder and along the urinary tract than Bell. The urging to urinate is constant.
The urine dribbles, and it burns intensely along the whole length of the urethra. The whole urinary tract is in a state of irritation.
Bell. has cured inflammation of the bladder. With the irritation and the congestion there is all the sensitiveness to pressure we find in any other part where Bell. is indicated; sensitive to a jar. irritable state of the mind, irritable state of the whole nervous system.
"Tenesmus of the bladder. After passing urine sits and strains," in torment.
The urine is diminished, bloody, sometimes pure blood, or little blood clots. A considerable quantity of blood in the bladder comes away in little clots.
"The urine looks as if mixed with brick dust, or streaks. Strongly acid."
There is a spasmodic retention of urine and. there is involuntary passing of urine. Dribbling of urine in brain troubles. During sleep, dribbling of urine.
Dreams that he is passing urine, and involuntarily passed it. Retention of urine after shock, or from congestion of the brain, or after confinement. Bladder full; great pain; great sensitiveness.
Involuntary dribbling while standing and walking; or sometimes from mere motion the urine spurts. The urging is violent and sudden. When a little urine has collected in the bladder he has a sudden, painful urging.
Much of the trouble is at the neck of the bladder, and it is spasmodic. He feels the spasmodic clutching. At the time of the urging, and at other times, he has spasm of the neck of the bladder, from shock, from cold, from anxiety, from mental disturbances.
When becoming old, or chilled, or in very cold air, women lose their urine, like Duleamara and Causticum. Starts in sleep, and wets bed.
Dreams of a fright, which causes a starting, and she wets the bed. On going to sleep, a sudden electric shock goes through the whole body, and she wets the bed.
Bell. is rich with such strange little peculiarities; but it only shows the general spasmodic condition and the general irritability of the whole Belladonna constitution.
We see those strange conditions and states, the irritability in all parts of the body, especially where there are sphincters, where there are circular fibres clutching in thy neck of the bladder; clutching at the mouth of the vagina; constriction of tubes. Constriction of the uterus.
Here we see a special marked feature of it, in the neck of the bladder. It has more troubles in the woman than in the man; that is in the symptoms and conditions in relation to the female sexual organs, and to parturition, and to the breasts, and during the period of gestation there are many conditions where Belladonna will be needed. It is really an important remedy for the nervous sensitive woman, the woman of irritable fiber.
Genitals: In the male genitals we have scarcely any important symptoms; but with the female there are many, and some very distressing ones.
They have symptoms of great suffering, of great excitability, The parts are sensitive; the uterus and ovaries are congested, sore to touch, sensitive to jar. Irritable uterus, until it has become enlarged and painful, and sore to the touch.
Sometimes it remains in this state after parturition. Or, after every menstrual period it is a little larger, and remains. It does not return to its normal state, but remains congested, and the woman feels all through the interim as if she was menstruating.
Bruised feeling; sensitive to a jar. The flow is copious and clotted. But the most striking feature here is the uterine haemorrhage. Uterine haemorrhage from congestion, with spasms, with great sensitiveness.
The uterus contracts with violence, hence, a spasmodic contraction. Great soreness, with a copious flow of bright red fluid mixed with clots, is the characteristic of the Belladonna flow.
It is like Sabina in that respect. Those two medicines have that in a high grade. The uterus fills with a clot, and then comes a contraction like a labor pain and expels it; for a while a copious flow of fluid; and then contractions like labor pains come on again, expelling the clots, and then comes the flow.
The blood clots soon, and the haemorrhage is attended with great exhaustion. Now this occurs almost without any provocation. This haemorrhage occurs also in connection with abortion, Belladonna is a great remedy to check the haemorrhage in connection with abortion or from any cause whatever where the symptoms of sensitiveness are present.
Sensitive to touch, sensitive to a jar; the patient herself is in that state of irritable sensitiveness, great nervous excitement manifested both when awake and in sleep, often with fever. Haemorrhage, with febrile conditions, but usually the haemorrhage takes the place of the fever, and commonly if there is haemorrhage it will relieve the fever.
It is also a great remedy for haemorrhage after confinement. The blood feels hot. Haemorrhage, with hour- glass contraction. It is not an uncommon thing for the placenta to be grasped in its middle by a, contraction like an hour-glass tearing it loose here and there, and from below comes the bleeding; a copious flow of blood. Bell. relieves this hour-glass contraction.
It has also the most violent dysmenorrhoea. Pains like labor-pains. Spasmodic labor-pains. Circular contractions are the commonest forms in Bell.
All of the fibers should take part uniformly and do their work uniformly, and thereby gradually bring to bear a tightening upon the contents. In Bell. it is just like a cord going around the body of the uterus, tightening it and it interferes with labor.
That is the way it is in its dysmenorrhoea. Violent contraction of the circular fibers, and hence, a woman will often describe it as feeling as if the uterus was clutched with a string. As if it were tightened. Bell. is rich in spasmodic conditions, in haemorrhagic conditions, in states of irritation, and in soreness, and the parts are sensitive to pain, and the woman herself is dreadfully wrought up and shocked by pain.
In addition to that, pains in the ovary. Belladonna acts in many instances on the right side. It is common for the right ovary to be more painful than the left, or the right to be entirely affected and the left not at all, in Belladonna. So it is with the right side of the throat. So it is sometimes in the right side of the body.
"Pains in the ovaries with the appearance of the menses. Pains in the pelvic region, which come on suddenly, and cease as suddenly."
The characteristic Belladonna pains come on suddenly, sometimes stay a few seconds, sometimes a few minutes, and leave suddenly. Pains from uterine congestion. Acute inflammation of the uterus.
"Enlargement of the uterus, and periodically spasmodic bearing down,"
It has a relaxation in the parts as well. The uterus has been congested and is enlarged, and heavy, and the little suspensory attachments have become relaxed, and tired, and weak, and have stretched and elongated, and the already distended and over weighted uterus keeps pulling on them, and this creates the sensation that women so often describe, a bearing down sensation as if the uterus would escape.
It is sometimes described as a funneling sensation. These are the expressions of women when they suffer from prolapsus. That relaxation is common in a great number that have been poisoned with Ergot.
The uterus comes down and is partly exposed between the labiae. Prolapsus as if the whole inner parts were coming out is a common feature, and with this she is worse from a jar.
There is a great sensitiveness in the parts. There is a great soreness in the uterus, and a sensation of heaviness. I have seen women sit with their limbs wide apart so sensitive is the neck of the uterus that is protruding from the vulva.
"Must sit; cannot lie down."
Many of the Bell. cases cannot lie down, because of the stretching of the abdominal muscles. When they lie down they must draw up the limbs to relax those muscles.
Must sit, or take a flexed posture. Great sensitiveness in the parts. Pressing and urging towards the genitals.
There are all sorts of positions, and aggravations, and ameliorations in Belladonna, in accordance with what particular muscles are involved.
Some patients can lie better than they can sit. Almost all are worse standing. Some are made better by sitting with the limbs, wide apart. Most are aggravated by bending forward too much. Sitting in a chair she cannot bend forward too much, neither can she bend backwards without increasing the suffering.
So sensitive, and so much swelling in these parts. She is worse from motion, worse from jar, worse from excitement, worse from the slamming of the door, because that makes the muscles twitch.
All this illustrates how sensitive the irritated parts are. Then in the external and internal genitals and ovaries there is burning, and twitching, and much heat. Often tearing pains; the tearing pains are generally an exaggeration of those clutchings and constrictions, and such are known as spasms especially of the circular fibres.
Belladonna is well suited to pregnant women who are extremely sensitive, who are plethoric, who have congestion from taking cold, who have soreness, where there is threatened abortion, or during or after
abortion when there are hemorrhages.
Then again Bell. is useful in red-faced plethoric, vigorous women who have married late in life and become pregnant, and when the day of delivery comes the muscular fibres are in a state of tension.
The uterus will not relax. She is flushed and has heat, and is in a state of excitement, sensitive to touch, sensitive to jar.
Relaxation will soon follow. It is not to be expected that she will have an easy labor, because women who marry at 28 or 30, or later, suffer from prolonged labor.
There is one strong feature of the hemorrhages and, of the discharges; the flow of blood feels hot. During confinement gushes of blood that feel hot. After abortion, gushes of blood that feel hot.
A lochial discharge that feels hot, along with the sensitiveness and soreness of the parts. Tenderness to pressure.
There are inflammatory conditions of the breasts accompanying confinement. Milk fever. When the breasts become red, extremely sensitive to touch.
She cannot turn over in bed; she cannot have the bed jarred, the face is flushed and the carotids are throbbing; there is fever; the sensitivity is aroused throughout the economy.
Great induration; hard as a stone. Bell. will stop the pain in the breast in a few hours. It will stop that congestion, and, will relieve all suffering.
When the mammary glands are inflamed without any general symptoms but merely an inflammation of the glands give Phytolacca.
Larynx: Inflammation of the larynx. There is that clutching again and choking. It begins with a- rawness in the throat a smarting, and scraping, and the formation of a little mucus. After much scraping and hawking, it extends up the throat a little but before, he begins to cough it is quite dry.
There is smarting, and loss of voice. As soon as he attempts to go into a sleep, that clutch comes on and wakes him up. Hoarseness and rawness and clutching in the throat.
Laryngitis with sensitiveness.
"Sudden attacks of hoarseness;"
every motion, or the slightest attempt to talk, the slightest effort to move the larynx or to touch it causes suffering.
Moving the head backward, or moving the head from side to side, causes pain and cough. Swallowing aggravates. As the bolus goes down behind the larynx he feels a great big sore place, it is the larynx. The voice changes.
One minute it is one key, and in another it changes. Sometimes it is hoarse and sometimes it is squeaky. And then, there is complete loss of voice, unable to utter a sound.
"Croup-like spasms in the larynx. Spasms of the glottis. All the symptoms of croup," but no membrane.
It is simply a dry, denuded larynx, with rawness and scraping; an inflamed condition. And this is the form of the acute laryngitis; it comes ort very suddenly. His respiration is short, rapid and painful. Often asthmatic.
Chest: Asthmatic condition, with spasmodic breathing. And again, these symptoms seem to involve the whole chest. Oppression of the chest. Asthma in hot damp weather.
The Belladonna cough comes on from clutching in the larynx. As it a little speck of something had crept into the larynx; a little dust, or a little food, or a drop of water had gotten into the larynx, and he coughs.
"Dry, spasmodic cough."
An intense cough. Cough at night. Cough when lying down, more at night than in the daytime. The cough is spasmodic, barking, short. It is a remedy for whooping cough, with spasms of the larynx which cause the whoop and difficulty of breathing.
Finally after long coughing, the expectoration of a little blood, or a little thin white mucus, is the result of the violent turmoil going on in the air passages from coughing. The Belladonna cough is peculiar.
As soon as its great violence, and the great effort have raised a little mucus he gets peace for a little while, and stops coughing. But during the restful period the larynx and the trachea, and the air passages grow dryer and dryer, and finally they commence to tickle, and then comes on the spasm, as if all the air passages were taking part in it, and the whoop and the gagging, and sometimes vomiting.
Then he gets up a little mucus and the cough subsides. Another little interval and he has another spell. That is the way its goes on, like whooping cough, but during, all of the interim there is constant dryness. Hence the cough is called paroxysmal.
Tightness in the chest, Painfulness in the chest. Soreness in the chest. In Bell. the child will cry the instant it feels that urging to cough, because it knows what a great suffering is going to take place. The chest is so painful, the child dreads the cough and screams. By the child's cry we know that it is going to havea coughing spell .
Just like, Bry.., Hepar and Phos., which have that feature more, than other remedies. There is burning in the chest; violent congestion in the chest; With all of these chest complaints there is that dry, harassing spasmodic cough; worse at night.
This remedy cures pneumonia and pleurisy. I am sure every one here could picture a Belladonna pneumonia, or a Belladonna pleurisy. | am sure you know the patient so well that I need not describe the
patient, the head, the congestion, the red face, or the burning; but in pleurisy I will tell you its secret. Bell. prefers the right side.
Great pain; extreme soreness of the part; cannot lie on it; worse from the jar of the bed and you have the Bell. pleurisy.
Bry. also prefers the right side, but the Bry. patient must lie on that side; must have pressure, and is not so sensitive to a jar; he has not the intense heat, he has riot the great throbbing, and the burning.
Every kind of sickness that you go to you have to individualize in that way. There is no other way to practice Homoeopathy.
Remember, with all the inflammatory conditions there will be throbbing heat redness, burning, soreness to touch, and sensitiveness to a jar.
With Bell. it means he cannot lie on the inflamed part; while with Bry. he is ameliorated from lying on the inflamed part.
Throbbing in all the arteries. Great congestion. Vascular excitement. These are present with all the congestions, and inflammations.
Joints: Belladonna cures inflammatory rheumatism, when all the joints are swollen, or a great number of them, and they are hot, red, and burn.
We have in the rheumatism the heat, redness and burning running through; with the same sensitiveness of the whole patient, and a sensitiveness of the joints to the jar of the bed.
He wants to lie perfectly still is very much worse from motion and has considerable fever. Sometimes when the fever in inflammatory rheumatism runs pretty high there is delirium. But the striking features are the swelling of the joints with the redness, and great sensitiveness to motion and to a jar.
It is especially suitable to those that are very sensitive to cold, who cannot bear the least uncovering, cannot bear a draft, very sensitive to the motion, of the covers, and ameliorated by heat.
The very stamp and character of Bell. is in its rheumatic state, like it is in all of its other complaints. It is the patient that has given Bell. that character in provings; it is the patient that gives disease that character when he had it, and it is only the fulfillment of the Law of Similars when these come, together, and the remedy annihilates the sickness.
Inflammation of the joints, coming on from sudden exposure of that particular joint. Or from a severe attack of cold one joint becomes inflamed. A trouble that is localizing itself. It may be any joint- of the body, for Bell, affects all the joints.
The sudden exposure to cold in plethoric individuals, is one of the most prominent. causes of the Bell. sickness. In chronic cases the taking of cold generally, locates, or creates, a disturbance, and increases disorder, that manifests itself in the weakest place.
Vigorous people take cold in the nose, where they throw it off easily. You can often say to sickly patients that your cold now affects you in the weakest place. If you have liver trouble,
"your cold will settle in the liver," and so on; "but when you get well you will take cold like other people, in the nose."
Absolutely healthy people seldom take cold, but we do not have many such, they are so rare that we do not often see them; and the snuffles, and sneezing, and the running at the nose are simply throwing off of the cold of ordinarily healthy people.
Limbs: In the limbs, again, we have convulsions, which is a part of the generals. In all the muscles in the limbs, and throughout the body, convulsions.
Children go into convulsions with head troubles, with congestion of the brain, with irritation of the brain. Convulsions from taking cold, in plethoric children, and the limbs are most, likely to show forth these convulsive efforts of the muscles.
Violent cramping. All the limbs are in a state of convulsive movements. Sometimes the spasms are clonic, and sometimes tonic. The convulsions in the limbs are sometimes such as draw them up, suddenly, throw them out suddenly; sometimes convulsions that throw the body backward, called opisthotonos, and sometimes throwing the body forward, called opisthotonos.
The most of the complaints in Bell. are ameliorated by keeping still. The drawing pains, the pulsations, the inflammatory conditions drive the patient into a desire for perfect rest, are aggravated from motion.
The disinclination and aversion to the slightest motion is common in Bell., and as strong in Bell. as in Bry. Bell. is so sensitive in parts that the motions of talking are painful; so sensitive that the conclusion of the voice is painful in the sore spots.
A person with a strong voice, a bass voice, hardly thinks of the concussion that takes place; and much less is that of the female voice, and yet I have seen that aggravation from motion, and that aggravation from jar so marked in the female that her voice was like the pounding of hammers. In inflammation of the uterus, and ovaries, and the bowels, she refrains from talking, because her voice creates a concussion in the sore parts.
That only illustrates the extremes of this great sensitiveness to motion and to jar. Jar is only an exaggerated form of motion, bringing out that sensitiveness.
If you will study the nerves you will find the greatest array of peculiar nervous manifestations, such as sensitiveness of the nerves, aggravated from shock; spasms; various disturbances of the whole nervous, system; twitching; jerking; trembling; subsultus tendinum, etc. Cramps, and spasms, and convulsions in children.
Convulsions: Convulsions come on, with great suddenness.
They come on entirely unexpected. In most instances of convulsions in the long acting remedies and medicines of the zymotic type, the patient has not been prospering in the last days of her gestation; but with Bell. she goes on part way through the labor, or finishes it, and little is expected.
Perhaps her face is a little too red, but she goes into a convulsion unexpectedly, a violent
one from head to foot.
Congestion of the brain, with excitement. Intense heat; everything is intense, violent, sudden and unexpected.
The pains sometimes leave in confinement suddenly, and a convulsion comes on. But look and see that all the sensitiveness that I have described runs through the patient.
The pains cease suddenly. The blood seems to mount to the head. The face becomes red. Congestions come on suddenly. Convulsions epileptiform in character.
Bell. is not suitable for those numerous recurrent complaints, even though the single attack should be mitigated with Bell. Take any of these attacks; whether they are convulsions or headaches, or congestion of the brain, they are running down and become excitable, take on congestive attacks of the head, go right to bed, and roll the head.
You treat those with Bell.; the attack is relieved. Take notice, I start out by saying this is only one of a series. You may not know it. This may be the first one.
You reduce that one, and when that same exposure comes again, that same attack comes back; but Bell. does less this time than it did before. After two or three attacks Bell. will do no more and you are worse off this time than you were before.
When it has broken the first one the physician should see that this is one of a series, and that Bell. is not suitable. Often it is a case that needs Calc., I say often, not always.
All the symptoms should be examined between the attacks, so that the child may be elevated above these attacks because the acute remedy will do no more than suit the first, or second, or third at most. It has not the depth of action, it has not the length of action. It does not affect the economy profoundly enough. It passes away after a few days; has to be frequently repeated.
The patient should be followed up and watched in all these recurrent spasmodic and periodical complaints. Bell. is not a good remedy for recurrent complaints for it lacks periodicity, just as it lacks continuance of complaints.
Even if the first attack looked like Bell.. the next attack would come back just the same. Belladonna is suitable in those complaints that if conquered have no tendency to recur; those complaints that end in death or recovery. It will only mitigate those complaints that are periodical.
Sleep: Its sleep is a congestive sleep, a stupor; full of dreams full of violence. Wake's with fright from a horrible dream, a nightmare. Jerks and twitches in sleep.
"Restless sleep." Moaning and groaning in sleep. Doing all sorts of violence. Delirium in sleep. "Starts in sleep as if frightened."
In sleep sometimes the patient will commence to talk, will talk faster and louder, the head becomes hot, and the feet cold, and he ends with a shriek.
"Restless tossing in sleep. Feet becoming icy cold in sleep. Head getting hot, in sleep. Wakes up in a fever, and excitement."
It has symptoms so much like a typical old-fashioned Sydenham scarlet fever that it has been useful in scarlet fever.
Perhaps it is one of the most frequently indicated medicines in that disease. In some seasons, at least it will run all through, and the majority of cases will be Bell. cases, with the bright red face and glossy appearance of the skin.
Bright red, intense heat, great congestion; after a short time if Bell. is not administered it will grow darker.
But running through all this are those three words, heat, redness and burning. Burning everywhere. The temperature I described among the generals as being so marked, so intense that you will carry it with you on the ends of your fingers for hours after you have touched a Bell. scarlet fever.
It differs wholly from the Apis case, which has a rough rash. Bell. is smooth and shining. Apis wants to be cool, wants to be uncovered; Bell. wants to be warm, wants a warm room; Apis has no thirst, to speak of; in Bell. it is the exception to have no thirst, generally very thirsty for water, little and often.
The intense dryness of the mucous membranes and skin. Coldness of the extremities with hot head. In Arum triphyllum there is a constant picking of the mouth, with suppressed or scanty urine; pale surface, only here and there a little rash; the itching of the fingers, toes, nose and lips will lead you to prescribe Arum.
You remember the Baptisia case, with that mental state where he is feeling all over the bed "to get the pieces together."
On the other hand, where there is no rash to speak of, now and then a patch enough to make a diagnosis, or the diagnosis is made from the fact of some one else having the disease in the family, the child is swallowing ice water, but vomiting it up when it gets warm in the stomach, who would not give Phosphorus?
So it is at the bedside we pick out the distinguishing, things and see that these remedies are not at all alike.
Bell. stands out with its heat, its redness, its turmoil. Remember it has, not continued fever; it is not suitable in typhoid. Bell. in a night will bring down the fever, will allay the delirium; but how is it the next night?
On comes the fever, and the patient is worse than he was before. Simply because Bell. cannot hold what it starts with. It is not suitable.
It has not that continued feature in it. We are led to a medicine that corresponds to continuous fevers, and such must be selected when we go into the typhoid state.
Our earlier practitioners often only thought of what they saw at the time. It was only after our school had considerable experience that it was found that periodicity constitutes a symptom.
Every remedy has its pace, its times of aggravation and its, times of amelioration.
So it is with Bell. . Its time is 3 o'clock in the afternoon, commonly. Its complaints, are generally worse in the night. Its complaints commonly start about three o'clock in the afternoon, and run till three in the morning, or until after midnight.
So that during the night its fever is highest. The fever comes on, and rises rapidly, to a very high temperature, sometimes 104 ° or 105 °, and runs down again to almost normal; but not with a complete apyrexia.
It is not suitable in complaints with complete apyrexia, for that marks complete periodicity which Bell. has not.
Skin: The heat, the redness and the burning characterize most of the skin symptoms.
It has a fine rash; not the coarse rash, but the fine, scarlet red, smooth rash. It has inflammation of the skin, phlegmonous, a deep inflammation.
First bright red, gradually grows bluish or purple, or mottled; and in this there is the heat, redness and burning.
It is not suitable generally for the erysipelatous inflammation of the skin and deeper tissues, covered with vesicles, like Rhus.
Vesiculation is sometimes present, but it is the exception, while in Rhus it is the general character. Rhus begins with inflammation; it has heat, redness and burning; but whenever Rhus begins an inflammation, just that instant it throws out a great blister and it fills with serum.
Almost any Bell. surface that is inflamed is likely to throw out a red rash. In intense fevers, where there are not scarlet fever or any of the common rashes, a red, fine, glossy eruption is likely to come out.
It is not an uncommon thing in congestion of the brain, and in bilious fevers, for this rash to appear, and it sometimes deceives the physician into making a diagnosis of one of the eruptive diseases, whereas it is a mere hybrid.
The Bell. skin, while it turns red, has such a passive redness that you can write your name, almost, on the skin. As you take your finger and make a line on it, it leaves a white line behind your finger.
That was an old diagnostic phase of scarlet fever, and it shows that Bell. produces upon the surface that peculiar passive congestion very much like the scarlatina. So we have in the Bell. provings a symptom that is even a pathognomonic symptom of scarlatina.
But we do not prescribe on a symptom. Of late years no homoeopathic physician ever thinks of giving a medicine simply for the purpose of bringing the pulse down, or bringing the fever down.
He prescribes for the patient. It is true that the temperature does come down, if we get the right remedy; but to prescribe a remedy to bring the pulse down is going at it wrong end to.
One who thinks homoeopathically never prescribes to remove a symptom; but guided by the symptoms he selects the remedy, no matter what follows.
It is true the symptoms subside. Others might say he prescribed to remove the symptoms, because they subside.
Learn to keep the ideal of Homeopathy in mind, and think rationally; in order to do that you will have to rid yourselves of a tremendous amount of inheritance.
We have inherited the way to think wrong end to. "Yellowness of the skin from congestion of the liver, and catarrh of the duodenum."
When persons have been over-medicated with quinine until they take cold on every occasion, and a sudden attack of congestion of the liver comes on, with the great soreness, and the skin becomes yellow with all the sensitiveness of this remedy, Bell. will cure such cases.
There are conditions that follow Bell. that relate to its chronic state. Where Bell. has been suitable for the acute conditions, the congestions, but there is that periodicity that I have mentioned, it has its natural followers, and Calcarea is one of them.
In boys that are big-headed, plump, plethoric, precocious, that take cold easily, and come down, with headaches and congestion; school children that get headaches which Bell.
At first helped; very commonly if you look carefully into the case it will turn out to be a Calc. case. It is so common for Calc. to relate in this way to Bell.
Now-a-days we frequently find the dry, backing cough in the hands of doctors who have given too much Lachesis.
Lachesis is commonly given to over-sensitive women, and it produces many of those conditions; it sometimes cures great troubles, but it leaves behind for weeks a dry, hacking cough that keeps her from
sleeping.
Sometimes it comes on after the first sleep, which is commonly about ii o'clock; a dry, hacking cough from lying down.
Bell. will cure this old effect of Lach., the nervous state and excitability and the cough. Bell. will be suitable as an antidote for Lach., that is, for the acute symptoms.
Calc. is an antidote for the more chronic effects of Lach.
After the abuse of Bell., Calc. comes in as one of the natural antidotes.
Benzoicum Acidum
C6H5_CO2H.
Whenever we see in the nature of a remedy a well-defined state and condition of the human system pointed out by certain distinctive groups of symptoms we may know that there is such a diseased state in the human family.
They have not the power to create by themselves any diseased state except there is first such a state in the economy of the human race to be aroused.
They simply call up in a single individual something that the individual has, and that something belongs to the human race, and so whenever we see a diseased state in the remedy we know that it exists in correspondence to something in the human race.
Things are so adjusted that everything is for use. There may be conditions in the human race that we, as yet, know no remedy for.
We see certain groups of peculiar symptoms frequently repeat themselves and we know they are representatives of a state of the economy, but up to this day we may not have seen in the Materia
Medica their counterpart.
In medicines we have the exact counterpart the diseases of the human race.
Gouty constitution: Now this remedy has a state and condition that is sometimes called the gouty constitution, the uraemic or the lithaemic constitution, and, these cases are very difficult to manage, as the state is so persistent. It is one of the manifestations of Psora.
Urines: These patients suffer more or less from irregularity in the action of the kidneys; sometimes the urine is scanty and then they suffer from bodily complaints; again the urine is copious and then they are relieved of their complaints.
They are subject to rheumatic attacks and pains in the joints, showing the gouty constitution, and then they have relief when the urine is copious and heavily laden with deposits; but on comes an attack when they have more or less urine, but it is light in specific gravity, and then they are full of pains; in that way they fluctuate.
Now, the young prescriber will sometimes see the patient when he is passing large quantities of uric acid forming the red pepper deposits and he thinks he must stop that; his main idea is to check that one particular thing.
But the patient is a great deal better off while he has it. To cheek it is like suppressing a skin eruption, or restraining any other manifestation of disease.
It will be noticed, as one of the foremost things in this remedy's manifestations, that it has strong smelling urine; the urine is pungent, and it sometimes becomes so strong that it smells like, Hippuricum acid, and so it is said urine smells strong like that of a horse.
The odor in this remedy approximates that of Hippuricum acid.
Complaints: The complaints then, of Benzoic acid are such as are changeable, and we know why they are changeable; when the urine is copious and plenty of uric acid is being passed, and the urine is full of deposits, then the patient is at his best; when the urine is scanty or of light specific gravity he suffers from
backache and pains in the joints, he suffers from atmospheric changes, is sensitive to cold drafts and to the air; but let the urine start up again, which it does in a sort of alternating way, light urine alternating with heavy urine, and the patient is comfortable again.
Then, there are complaints in which the urine smells strong and pungent; this often occurs in children. It is astonishing that these little ones manifest the uric acid diathesis in early life.
Children: Mothers often describe it as intensely urinous. It smells like intensified urine; it is not the smell, so much, of decomposed urine nor of foetid urine, but urine intensified.
It has cured many times wetting the bed involuntary urination in sleep, when the bed that has been wetted several times becomes uncleanable.
You can smell it almost as quick as you go into the room; the children all, smell like urine, strong urine; the house smells like urine. If two or three of these little fellows wet the bed at night, the urine is so strong it tells the story at once.
This medicine needs reproving; details have not been brought ou yet in nature is known. We have a good many medicines having this nature, but this is perhaps as intense as any.
This remedy does not. of course, fit all these patients, because it does not fit their special symptoms; but it has the nature or general state which, of course, precedes everything, and when it relates to all the particulars as well it does make wonderful changes.
Mind: There are a few mental symptoms.
"Inclined to dwell on unpleasant things; if he saw anyone deformed, it made him shudder."
Alternation of profound sleep with prolonged periods of wakefulness. In the period of wakefulness, he dwells, during the night, upon all the unpleasant subjects that he can think of.
This state alternates with nights of stupid sleep for weeks, and this fluctuates, in accordance with the fluctuation of the state of urine.
"Sadness." "Anxiety while sweating."
"Child cross."
Head: There are many headaches; they are uraemic in character and come in many regions with many details.
"Fearful pain in occiput or cerebellum." "Rheumatic pains in head."
That is well described, because these headaches of uraemic character take on a similarity to rheumatic pains.
"Pain and heat in region of organs of reverence and firmness." m * * m W Tearing pain in vertex.
The headaches are very numerous; the remedy is full of dull, aching occipital headaches, coming on in the night from change of weather.
Pains located in the base of the brain after pains have existed for some time in the joints, and they are passing but little urine.
Every time he takes a little cold the urine becomes scanty and he is full of dull aches and pains in the head and especially in the occiput.
Smell: Perversion of smell. "Sense of smell diminished."
"Pain in nasal bones."
Tongue: Another form of transformation scene takes place in this remedy, when all the gouty symptoms of the body cease and inflammation of the tongue comes on.
The pains in the joints cease suddenly from taking cold, from stormy weather and on comes a sudden swelling of the tongue.
Mercury also has this state. "Extensive ulcerations of tongue, with deeply chapped or fungoid surfaces." Then, again peculiar kinds of sore throat take place from this same cause.
Sudden stoppage or slacking up of the quantity of urine; it becomes scanty, high colored, and pungent, smelling like that of a horse (Nitric acid) along with acute inflammation and swelling of the tonsils and throat inflammation of the tonsils with scanty, strong, pungent urine smelling like that of a horse.
Metastasis: Another feature that seems almost like metastasis.
Take an individual who is going around with more or less rheumatic aches in the joints; he takes cold and all this ceases, but the next day he comes down with inflammation of the tongue or sore throat, or inflammation of the stomach; so that he vomits every thing he eats.
The gout goes to different parts and in this instance it goes to the stomach; and then Benzoic acid, Antimonium, crud. or Sanguinaria is likely to be useful.
When it goes to the throat or is followed by swelling of the tongue Mercury and Benzoic acid should be thought of.
Whenever this gouty condition goes to the stomach, of course it must conform to those symptoms that are in the nature of this remedy.
In this remedy we have:
"loathing, sickness at Stomach," "nausea with gagging,”
"vomiting of a salty substance; bitter,”
When we think of Benzoic acid for the stomach symptoms, it is important that we have in mind its whole nature, how it brings about its complaints and what characterizes a Benzoic acid patient.
We would not be able to distinguish from the stomach symptoms alone we must carry with them the character of the remedy.
Stools: It has much disturbance of the liver, and many liver symptoms. As to the bowels, the stool, the rectum, anus and urinary organs, it is very rich in symptoms.
Its striking ones | will call your attention to, but remember its migrating, metastatic nature, its complaints going from one part to another, which will accompany these symptoms.
"Stools, copious, watery." This is true in summer diarrhoea that has come on suddenly, "excessively offensive,"
The white stool, like soap-suds, is so strong a symptom that the remedy does not fail to cure even when the gouty constitution is not present.
"Excessively offensive, scenting the whole house." "Putrid, bloody." "Watery, light-colored, very offensive stools (in children)."
So we get the idea that the stools are white and that the first passages are like soap-suds, but later the soap appearance subsides and leaves a white stool.
It is well, often, when a stool is passed that is of a light liquid, to bear in mind a few remedies that produce this state and ascertain whether it is like soapsuds or filled with bubbles of air.
"Diarrhea of children."
The urinous odor of the body, and especially that peculiarly pungent, intense smell of the urine. "Slightly elevated, wart-like, round surfaces around anus."
The urinary symptoms are too numerous to read.
"Foetid urine.”
"Urine of a very repulsive odor." "Effervescing with hydrochloric acids." The odor is sometimes like hartshorn; it is pungent; these are only efforts to describe the strong smell.
"Urine dark brown."
It is true that normal urine after standing a while will get a foetid odor, but in this remedy, that just passed is properly described as being intensely urinous.
"Urine contains mucus and pus."
"Morbid condition of urine renders urine acid."
it says in the text "Hippuricum acid," but this is a rare condition. "Brown urine smells sour."
"Too frequent desire to evacuate bladder."
"Nephritic colic."
"Urine dark, urinous odor highly intensified."
Gouty troubles of the liver; rheumatism; nephritic colic; it has cured such states after gonorrhoea, but it is not much of a gonorrhoeal remedy.
When the rheumatic states and these symptoms are present there are more or less pains in the kidney. " Sore pain in the back; burning in the kidney."
"Prolapsus uteri with foetid urine."
"Retention of urine in infants."
"Asthma with inflammatory rheumatic complaints.
"Cough followed by expectoration of green mucus."
Heart: The organ that is most commonly affected in these rheumatic complaints is the heart. No organ is so likely to be affected when rheumatism leaves the outermost parts as the heart.
Pains in the heart. So in this diathesis, with the strong smelling urine and the gout, we may expect affections of the heart.
"Pains change place incessantly."
"Palpitation of the heart."
The rheumatism, of course, is affecting the heart. "Awakens after midnight with violent pulsations of the heart." Think a moment and you will see in what kind ofa case you will need Benzoic acid.
The constitution of the remedy comes to mind at once with the heart symptoms, the dyspnea, pain in the heart with rheumatic symptoms;
"cannot go to sleep."
Think of the alternation of sleeplessness with sleep; think of the strong urine, of the fluctuating complaints, of the erratic constitution.
"Palpitation worse at night." "Rheumatic pains in extremities relieving heart."
There we get relief; complaints going back to the extremities with relief to the heart. The heart will relieve when the urine becomes copious or when the rheumatism goes back to the extremities, into the fingers and knees, especially the knees in Benzoic acid.
Rheumatism alternating between the extremities and heart. This medicine has cured affections of the heart when the rheumatism has a long time ago disappeared from the extremities and has ever since been affecting the heart; after Benzoic acid has been administered a very good sign of its action is that the extremities become painful and the urine becomes copious; free urine and solids increased; the urine becomes heavy, whereas it was light.
"Hard, frequent pulse."
Extremities: The extremities are full of rheumatic affections. "Lassitude in lower limbs."
"Swelling of knee."
All gouty affections belong to this remedy.
"Gouty concretions."
"Nodes on joints."
Benzoic acid is often an excellent palliating remedy in old gouty constitutions; they want to be relieved of the pains in their fingers and in the nodes and joints. The fingers crack and are clumsy and painful.
But often the pain has been relieved and gone to other parts. This is one among the remedies that will drive the complaints away from the internal organs and generally increase the pain in the extremities, which they will scold about.
"Trembling with palpitation of heart."
"Extreme weakness; sweat and comatose condition."
Note that comatose condition with sweat; the Benzoic acid patient sweats without relief.
Copious, exhaustive sweat and profound sleep, but there is no relief.
"Awaken with difficulty of breathing."
Pulsation all over.
"All sorts of catarrhal states; gouty diathesis, gout with arthritic nodosites, syphilitic rheumatism, etc."
These patients are getting low down in the scale of life, the tissues become feeble. Ulcers form upon the skin and mucous membranes.
Berberis
Generalities: When we have finished the study of Berberis we will see that it is not a very extensive remedy, but it is a very important one.
Like Benzoic acid, it fits into the gouty and rheumatic sphere. It corresponds to such gouty conditions as do not determine to their proper places.
A low state of the economy is present; anaemic condition; feeble constitution; pallid and sickly, old and worn out; prematurely old and wrinkled men and women.
They are too feeble to determine the gouty deposits to the finger joints, where they naturally belong, and the trouble is yet, as it were, wandering around through the economy.
Wandering pains in the nerves, and nerve sheaths. The wandering, stitching, tearing, twinging pains that run through Berberis are found in old gouty constitutions, and that is where we get the greatest benefit from Berberis.
Pains and urines: Its proving would lead us to see it is similar to the wandering, twinging and tearing pains of old gouty constitutions, in persons who are pallid, and sickly, and chilly, where the deposits have not been so marked in the joints; but where the twinging in the fingers and in the toes are just such as are found - where the deposits do exist.
Of course in all of the gouty states we must look to the liver and kidneys for pains and various distresses; they are centers of observation, because these organs are more or less disturbed. And very often cardiac troubles go along with them.
The kidneys, liver, and heart are more or less disturbed in their functions and we see that Berberis takes hold of these organs. We have the uraemic state, and the state of disorder that ends in these conditions. We will have twinging pains along with kidney disturbances.
Irregularities of the urine. Copious discharges, alternating with scanty discharges. Light urine, and heavy urine, excessive deposits of uric acid and urates.
It is changeable, like Benzoic acid. These two remedies run very much together, yet their symptoms are wholly unlike. We find among these sensations that stitching pains are found in almost every region of the body, and they are all the time changing.
Wandering and stitching pains; little twinges. As you sit by his side and talk to a gouty patient- "Ow," he will say. What does he mean by it?
He has had one of those twitching pains. The next thing he knows it is in his knee; then it is in his toes; then it is in his head, all over him.
Finally the gouty deposits become prominent in the fingers, and after the gout has determined itself, then we have sore fingers; but these corresponds more particularly to Ledum, Sulphur, Aesculus and Lycopodium, where the disease has become marked and has located in the joints.
In Berberis these twinging, tearing, stitching, burning pains are everywhere, they never remain in one place, but are always moving, and they are not often affected by motion.
Whether he moves, or keeps still, they keep coming. In a few instances we have pains aggravated by motion, but a very few in proportion to the many pains in Berberis.
He moves many times, because he cannot keep still. He moves, because he suffers. There are also many pressing pains. But the burning, stinging, tearing, stitching, wandering pains are the main feature, the grand feature of Berberis.
If you single them out in places, in a given joint, from that one joint they will radiate in every direction. If it is the knee joint, they will go up; and down, and every way; if it is the finger joint, they will run in every direction.
If it is the kidney, they will go down the ureters; if it is the liver, they will go down into the abdomen in every direction.
"Radiating from a particular point,” is a distinguishing feature, and it puts Berberis almost alone for radiating pains. This is such a strong feature that Berberis, has cured renal colic in many instances because of its well known ability to shoot out in every direction.
It cures gall-stone colic when these little twinges go in every direction from that locality. We see these twinging, shooting pains in gouty constitutions are associated with urinary troubles, and with liver troubles, and we begin to lay a foundation for the study of Berberis.
The joints sometimes swell. "Enlargement of the joints.” But the swelling is not so common as the pains without swelling. Soreness, lameness in the joints, with
these radiating pains. There will be burning, stitching, tearing, and the pains will radiate and appear in one part of the body then in another.
"A pain in the heel as if it were ulcerating,” and then the pain shoots off in every direction. Numbness. Lameness.
As to the heart, the pulse becomes slow. Very often it is slowed down astonishingly.
Mind: The mental symptoms are very defective, that is, we do not know the mental symptoms. There are a few. We know this, that the mind is weak, that he is unable to sustain a mental effort, and that he is forgetful.
"Defective recollection and weak memory. Terrifying apparitions in twilight."
It is not a strange thing for a child in the dark to imagine all sorts of things, because they have heard graveyard stories from old people; but with this remedy between the daylight and darkness he sees ghosts, imaginary forms - coming round him. It has melancholy, apathy, prostration of mind.
Head: Some dizziness. The headaches are of the game character as the general pains in uraemic subjects, where there is plenty of sand in the urine, red pepper deposit.
The head comes in for its share of these wander ing, pains. Stitching, tearing, twinging in the scalp; in the skull; in the eyes, ears, back of the head. Burning pains.
"A feeling in the head, as if it was becoming large," is a peculiar symptom; a puffy sensation.
Always putting the hand to the head; it feels as if he had on a skull-cap. It fits down over the brow, and it is not an uncommon thing with such patients to put the hand to the head to take off the cap.
"Feels as, if he had a cap on the head," when there is none there.
This symptom is not always described like a cap on the head. It is convertible into numbness of the scalp; many patients describe a sensation of numbness in the scalp, as if they had on a cap.
Some times patients will deny that it is a sensation of numbness, and say it is just a cap. At one time I fully believed the "cap" belonged to two sensations. If it was painful I placed it under "pressure." If it was not painful it was supposed to belong to "numbness;” but I have now made a new rubric, "the sensation of skull- cap,” which I now think is entirely distinctive, from numbness; but they both have to be compared.
Eyes: Then the eyes take on that same gouty condition, with stitching, tearing pains, twinging pains, shooting pains. Shooting off in various directions.
There is one grand feature about Berberis, that it has no particular direction; it has all directions. Most remedies have pains taking a direction from one part to the other, pains going from the eye to the temple, etc., but in Berberis it cannot be said the pains go to any place in particular.
They are wandering pains and they radiate. Pains in the ears of the same character. In every part of the body we have these twinging, tearing, burning, shooting pains coming and going, causing the patient to scowl and make a sharp noise.
The patient has a sickly look; face pale, earthy complexion, with sunken cheeks and hollow, blue-encircled eyes.
That is a description of a sick face. Berberis has been very useful in phtisical conditions; and in the pains, and twinging, and sufferings in persons who have been operated on for fistula in ano.
When the fistula has been closed, these pains will come if it is a Berberis case. The kidney manifestations will come on, or the liver manifestations, or the enfeebled heart, or these wandering pains.
At one time feverish, full of pains, with violent thirst; alternating with the very opposite state. Prostration land - aversion to water. Want of appetite at one time; canine hunger at another.
The stomach is disordered, digestion is glow and feeble, and we have manifestations usually known to patients as "bilious."
Liver: Eructations that are bitter and of bile. The liver is full of suffering.
In the liver we have these pains, and added to them sudden stabbing like a knife puncturing the liver. Shooting, tearing, burning, stitching, twinging pains, wandering from one place to another.
"Gall-stone colic."
These pains with jaundice. The liver seems to slow down in its actions, and the patients becomes, jaundiced.
The stool becomes white, bileless.
"Sharp, pinching pains in the liver, which come suddenly and with great severity. Violent stabbing pain in the region of the liver, taking his breath away. Had to bend double."
These pains last a moment and pass away. In gall- stone colic pains are spasmodic, increase in intensity and diminish, but do. not let up entirely.
Berberis when it is indicated will let the little gall-stone loose, and it will pass through, and the patient will
take a long breath and wish he had sent for the doctor sooner. Any thing that is spasmodic can be relieved instantly.
Anus and Stools: Pains through the abdomen. Copious, thick, mushy stools, and these are yellow, like yellow corn meal mush.
"Diarrhoea; mush-like yellowish discharges." "Clay-colored." From what we have seen it is not surprising that it is clay-colored, that it is bileless, that it is white.
The action on the liver does that. When you have these symptoms associated, with radiating pains, and with wandering pains in broken down constitutions, persons who are suffering from cold, who are pallid and sickly, you have a Berberis case.
Then the patient becomes constipated, but the stool is white, or very light colored.
"Burning, stinging pain before, during, and after stool."
"Enlargement of the prostate gland, which causes a constant pressure in the perineum. Pressure as if there were a lump, or as if something was pressing down.”
"Tearing extending around the anus. Herpes around anus. Fistula in ano."
Now the surgeons nearly all advocate that if there is a fistulous opening around the anus it must be operated upon. Homoeopathy cures such cases. I have, not operated on one for twenty years. The remedy that is indicated for the patient will cure the patient, and the fistula.
Above all things they should not be operated on. To close up that fistulous opening, and thus neglect the patient, is a very dangerous thing to do. Knowing all that I know, if such a trouble should come upon me and I could not find the remedy to cure it I would bear with it patiently, knowing I was keeping a much less grievance.
Nor I could I advise my patient to have, a thing done that I would not have done upon myself. It is a dangerous thing to operate upon a fistula in ano.
It is a very serious matter. If it is closed up, and that patient is leaning towards phthisis, he will develop phthisis; if he has a tendency towards Bright's disease, that will hasten it; if he threatens to break down in any direction; his weakest parts will be affected and he will break down.
Occasionally time enough elapses so that the physician who is ignorant does not see the relation between the two. But now that you have heard it, you can never forget it.
Kidneys: And then the kidneys and the urinary organs come in for their troubles. There is such a soreness in the lumbar region, in the region of the kidneys, that he can bear no pressure.
He cannot step down from a carriage to the pavement without letting himself down very carefully. A jar is a great shock to him, and sometimes the soreness is so great that he almost faints.
Soreness in the back; in the muscles of the back, and in the region of the kidneys; and this associated with all sorts of disturbances in the urine, with excessive deposits.
The kidneys radiate in every direction. Pains run up into the kidney, and they become worn out if he does not get relief, he will have some serious disease. Hence we have these symptoms.
"Burning and soreness in the region of the kidneys. Burning stitches, single or several in succession, in regions of loins and kidneys. Much pain, soreness and tenderness in back, in the region of the kidneys. Sensitiveness in the region of the kidneys so great that any jarring motion, riding in a wagon, jumping from it, was intolerable. After kidney complaints, a foul, bitter taste, rush of blood to the throat. Great urging, with pain in the neck of the bladder, with burning, scanty urine. Violent, cutting, tensive pain, deeply seated in left side of bladder, at last becoming a sticking, obliquely in female urethra, as if in its orifice, lasting a 'few minutes."
Now we see how these symptoms manifest themselves. Sore, inflamed, sensitive kidney, one or both.
And then, the formation of little calculi in the pelvis of the kidney - little stones like pinheads; and every now and then one of them takes a start down the ureter to the bladder, and, oh, how he suffers.
Then it is that the pains in the kidneys radiate in every direction. Pains run up into the kidneys and down into the bladder.
In the male they appear as if, they ran down the spermatic cord into the testes, and he is a great sufferer. You will, be astonished to know how quickly Berberis will relieve this particular kind of renal colic. Burning pain in the bladder; burning pain in the kidney.
"Urine dark, turbid with copious sediment. Urine very slow to flow. Constant urging.”
The bladder becomes very irritable. Catarrhal conditions of the bladder. Smarting, burning, stitch ing pains. Many troubles, pains and aches in the spermatic cord and testes in gouty constitutions. Burning pains along these regions.
Berberis especially fits a woman who is tired, with a gouty constitution; though not old in years she is physically tired, so that all of her domestic affairs fret and tire her.
Coition becomes painful, and she has an aversion to it. The orgasm is delayed, or is entirely absent, and she is prostrated by it.
In all the affairs of her innermost life she is a drudge. Full of twinging pains in all of her nerves. "Burning in the female urethra. Burning pain in the vagina".
A lack of sensation normal to these parts in the woman.
Borax
Borax is one of those domestic remedies that has been long used for local conditions as a soothing substance and for a healing purpose.
In "nursing sore mouth" of mother or child Borax has been used in the families of old, in the form of Borax and honey, as a wash.
The extensive use that has been made of it would make the homoeopath wonder if the people had not hit upon something, and it is a fact that Borax will rapidly heal up a sore mouth.
It is not strange that it does so, for Borax, in its proving, produces aphthous conditions of the mouth, which extend to the throat and even into the stomach. It cures where the genitalia and anus are covered with these aphthous appearances.
Mind: Anxiety, fidgetiness, and sensitiveness are prominent in Borax. He is anxious about trifles. He starts at every noise, on hearing unexpected news, from music, from excitement.
This anxiety or nervousness, this indescribable feeling that is within him, is aggravated from upward or downward motion.
Such a motion as going up in one-of our elevators nearly drives him to distraction, but he is made worse going down. All complaints are aggravated from downward motion.
It has been said in routine practice, that in all cases of sore mouth in children, when the child is worse from downward motion, Borax is the remedy.
When the mother is in the act of laying the child down on the bed it often rouses up in its sleep and cries out in fright. The anxiety may be better appreciated if you will go to the top of one of these high buildings and go down in the elevator.
It is natural for every one to feel, with the rapid motion, an anxious feeling in the Stomach, a sensation of falling; that is natural to the healthy man, but if you exaggerate that intensely you have the Borax condition in which the slightest downward motion, of even riding down hill or walking down stairs, or, in the child,
when being carried down stairs in the mother's arms, produces a violent aggravation. All the nerves are ina fret.
We notice that Borax has an intensified activity throughout the body; all of his senses are made more acute.
His hearing is intensified, he is oversensitive to his surroundings, over-anxious. He has an excitable spirit throughout. Riding down hill produces vertigo.
On nervous excitement, fear and apprehension. This is a strong feature of Borax. It has many such symptoms, but the nervous elements, partake of this type.
As we go through the remedy many other things will be called out; but this may be said to be the principal feature of the mental state, and it is to a great extent the key to Borax cases.
"Anxious feeling during downward motion or rocking.”
The diarrhoea will be cured when that state is present. Aphthae will be cured when that state is present. The rheumatism, menstrual troubles and numerous other complaints will disappear upon the administration of Borax, when this key is present.
It has hysterical manifestations. "Changes from one work to another."
It has a restless, nervous, anxious, excitable state that runs through his body. The child screeches and screams when it is dandled and tossed up and down.
The motion of the brain, the upward and downward motion, as in swinging, rocking, etc., makes the patient lose himself, he hardly knows where he is; confusion and vertigo come over him. If one rocks the child, it has an anxious expression of face.
"Very anxious on riding rapidly down hill."
"Anxiety increased until 1 P.M."
That I have noticed in Borax as a peculiar time of aggravation of the anxiety. I have noticed it in women who had periods of insanity, whose nervous trouble and mental state would keep up until 1 P.M. You will
notice sometimes in insane people that it seems as if they were possessed of the devil; and at once a lucid interval will come and they will talk just as if nothing had happened.
So it is in Borax that a great change may occur at 11 P.M.; this state of anxiety and nervous excitement may stop at that hour.
"Fretful, ill-humored, indolent" state increased until there is a stool and relieved by stool.
"He starts on hearing an anxious cry;" on hearing an unexpected noise, on bearing something drop from a chair to the floor, or if a door opens unexpectedly.
This is all in keeping with the nature of Borax. If you compare Borax with other Natrums you will find an astonishing likeness in the nervous excitability; Natrum carb. and Natrum mur.
Aggravation from noise, oversensitiveness to noise and overexcitement of the nerves run through all the Sodium family. They are wonderfully intense people.
"While engaged in thinking at his work, strong nausea."
Borax has many times cured this kind of trouble. I have seen it come up in this way; from any sort of meditation he becomes nauseated and excitable and must leave his work and rest a little while, and then he goes at it again until be becomes sick at the stomach and so must rest again.
With the aggravation from mental exertion, from noise, from excitement, from downward motion, we get the mental aspect of Borax.
A further examination of the sensorium shows: "Vertigo and fullness in head on descending a mountain or stairs."
This is a form of the same anxious feeling. This remedy has a good deal of vertigo, sometimes constant vertigo, which is made so intense on downward motion that be must sit still, and do nothing.
It has many congestive headaches, pressive headaches and much beat in the head. Eyes: There are many eye symptoms.
"Granular lids."
"Lashes turn inward towards eye and inflame it. Entropion."
Granulation and thickening of the mucous membrane of the lid; contractions and scars and drawing inward.
"Lower lids entirely inverted."
"Difficult opening of lids"
Nose: Like all the salts of Sodium the nose suffers from chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane, a catarrhal state, with copious discharge, and crusts in the nose; stoppage of the nose. The whole Natrum family has these dry crusts in the nose, and copious discharges from the nose.
Natrum mur. predominantly produces white discharge, and so does Borax; Natr. sulph. produces yellow discharge, and so does Borax; Natr. sulph. produces yellow discharge from the nose, even yellowish-green.
Borax is laid down as producing greenish discharge; its characteristic discharge, which is a general of the remedy, is a white discharge.
Face: The face of the infant is pale, and clay-colored. "Children have small vesicles around the mouth, and on the forehead."
Natr. mur. produces herpetic eruptions around the mouth in all of its febrile states, and when the patient takes cold. Borax is sometimes forgotten, and Natr. mur. is thought of because it is better known.
When the Natrum constitution is present, then it becomes a process of individualization to determine which one of the Natrums is indicated.
"Aphthae in mouth and on tongue." "Aphthae on tongue and inside of cheek."
This alone is not an indication for Borax, although Borax is one among many medicines when the mouth is so sore that the child lets loose its hold of the nipple or bottle. Many prescribers give Borax on that indication alone; but the constitutional state ought to be hunted up, so that there may be constitutional foundation for the remedy.
Sulph. ac. is more frequently indicated. "Red blisters on tongue." "Vomiting after drinking.”
This leads one to expect that this aphthous state has traveled down the oesophagus into the stomach. There are many stomach symptoms present that are likely to be the result of some such condition.
"Buccal mucous membrane highly reddened."
The sore mouth, such as mothers have and such as infants have, can be cured with Borax. "After every meal flatulent distension."
"Constant vomiting."
"Vomiting of sour slime."
The Borax patient with stomach aphthae will gag and retch and cough, and that is what is called a "stomach cough."
Mothers say, "It is a stomach cough,” because the child gags and retches with it.
"Stomach cough with pain extending into region of spleen."
Anus and stools: Little ones often get summer complaints when they need Borax. All around about the anus you will see the aphthous appearances. Great slimy stools are passed day and night; the child keeps up a pitiful crying; the mouth is aphthous, child is emaciating, and holds its head back.
"Stools; frequent, soft, light yellow, slimy."
Quantities of fluid like boiled starch are emitted from the anus; Borax has that as well as Argentum nitricum.
There are also conditions of the rectum producing thickening of the mucous membrane, with stricture, growing, smaller and smaller until finally a long thin stool is passed, no larger than a pencil. This inflammatory stricture has been cured by Borax.
Urines: In this over-sensitive child when the catarrhal state is general the urine burns so when it passes that with the first urging (which causes the child to realize it must soon urinate) it screams out; screams with the desire to urinate.
That is what it means when it says
"Worse before urination.”
it is not that the state of the urinary organs is worse before urinating, but the child in realizing that it must urinate screeches and screams.
"Frequent urination preceded by cries."
The urine burns and you may know that the child must soon urinate because it commences to cry. "Orifice of urethra pains as if sore, after urinating.”
"Desire to urinate without being able to pass a drop."
This remedy has cured gonorrhoea. Wherever there is mucous membrane you may expect to find the aphthous patches. There is another feature like Natr. mur. and Natr. Carb.; in both male and female it takes away sexual desire; it benumbs the patient, and hence the mind and sexual organs are in a state of indifference.
Females, mothers and children: Then we come to the most striking feature of Borax in regard to the female sexual organs; in the menstrual flow will be found membrane.
Borax cures the most violent forms of membranous dysmenorrhoea, when there are violent labor-like pains before and during the flow and it seems as if the uterus would expel itself from the vagina.
The flow starts slightly, but the same violent pains keep on, until the expulsion of the membrane. I have known Borax to cure when the membrane was a cast of the uterus. Such patients are easily startled from downward motion; let that be your guide to Borax in membranous dysmenorrhoea.
She dreads downward motion, and motions like swinging and rocking.
"During menses; throbbing in head and rushing in ears."
"Pinching and griping in abdomen;"
that word does not describe it exactly, for it is like the pain in labor;
"pain extending from stomach."
Pain like the stabbing of a knife in the groin, and that may occur either before or during menstruation.
"Tired; sweat after midnight."
But, remember, with such things you must have the mental state, the nervous, ex citable state and then Borax will cure this dysmenorrhoea.
Another grand feature of Borax I read in the next sentence.
"Leucorrhoea like the white of eggs."
It has albuminous leucorrhoea which feels like a hot fluid, and flows down the legs. "White albuminous or starchy leucorrhoea."
"Acrid leucorrhoea appearing for two weeks."
"Leucorrhoea white as mucus, without any other ailment."
Now from this acrid leucorrhoea, from the menstrual state, this false membrane forming and being thrown off, it is no wonder that women are sterile.
All these women are sterile, all who have such symptoms are sterile and Borax has cured sterility when this condition was the cause. You will find routinists prescribe Borax for all women who are sterile, regardless of the state. When a remedy is given for sterility, the state must be looked into which is peculiar to the remedy given such a state as that remedy can produce upon the healthy woman.
Another feature. Many times I have used Borax when the mother could not nurse the child; she talks about always having a little, thick milk.
"The milk is too thick and tastes badly."
This condition of the milk prevents the mother from nursing her child. This is a constitutional state, and Borax, if given in the beginning of pregnancy, to a Borax patient will so change the milk as well as the rest of the constitution that the mother will be able to nurse the child.
I have a number of times, when a mother has brought forth several children that she was unable to nurse, given Borax and it has so affected the case that she could nurse the next child. This remedy also has loathing of the breast in infants, due to the fact that the milk tastes bad and not due to any defect on the part of the child.
You might think of prescribing for the infant, but if you examine into the case you will find that the child will not take the milk, because it is loathsome. The mother needs a dose of Borax, which will cure the child of its diarrhoea and loathing of milk.
"The infant becomes pale, nearly earth-colored."
"The child throws up its hands when an attempt is made to put it down."
If the mother was a Borax mother, the child very likely is a Borax child; it is not an uncommon thing for the mother and baby to need the same remedy; many times I have medicated the child through the mother's milk if both needed the same remedy.
Another peculiar feature is that when the child is nursing, there is pain in the opposite breast. Borax is not necessarily limited to the state of confinement; there is a practical use for Borax among nervous women in
all states of life.
Borax has cured pleurisy that very much resembled Bryonia, especially on the right side like Bryonia; stitching or darting pains from without inward as if through the upper right lung posteriorly
the stitching pains might make you think of Bryonia.
"Wilted, wrinkled skin."
"Skin pale or livid."
Emaciated; flabby child becomes emaciated. Children become marasmic along with the aphthous condition; they cannot digest. They vomit or have diarrhoea; aphthous condition that extends the whole length of the intestines; involving all mucous membranes. Oversensitive child, screams from downward motion. The aphthae involve a good many other symptoms; crying before urination, because the bladder is
involved.
The aphthous condition and worse from downward motion; the oversensitiveness to noise, easily startled, anxious feeding, etc., are the most striking and characterizing features.
Bromium
Bromium is one of the routine medicines.
It is one of the medicines that the neophyte will make use of for every case of diphtheria and croup, and laryngitis he comes across; and when it does not work he will "try something else."
All who prescribe on the name use Bromium as one of their routine medicines; but Bromium is so seldom indicated that most homoeopaths give it up as a perfectly useless medicine.
The reason is that they do not take the symptoms of the case and prescribe in accordance with the individualizing method.
They do not prescribe for the patient, but for the disease. You may see very few cases of diphtheria calling for Bromium; but when you see a Bromium case you want to know Bromium.
There is one underlying feature of the Bromium conditions, they are found especially in those individuals that are made sick from being heated.
It there is a diphtheria epidemic and the mother bundles up her baby until she overheats it, and keeps it in a hot room, and it happens to be a child that is sensitive to being wrapped up, and one whose complaints are worse from being wrapped up, look out.
You are going to have a Bromium diphtheria. It is indicated also in complaints that come on in the night after a very hot day in the summer.
Now, this is as near as you can come to being routine in croup and diphtheria. If the mother has the baby out in a dreadfully cold, dry day, and along towards midnight it wakens with spasmodic croup, you know that it is more likely to call for Aconite than any other medicine.
But if the mother has had the baby out in a hot day in the summer, and that baby has been overheated, with too much clothing, and it is a plethoric child, and towards midnight you are called up, and the child has a red face, and your examinations reveal a membrane in the throat, we will see as we study the remedy that this may be a Bromium case.
"Hoarseness coming on from getting overheated."
Loss of voice coming on from getting overheated. A turmoil in the whole economy; with headaches, coming on from getting overheated. That runs through Bromium. So it is in the hot weather, and being confined to a hot room, and after going from the cold into the heat.
But after the complaint comes on, no matter where it is, he is so sensitive to cold that a draft of cool air freezes him; but he cannot be overheated without suffering.
Glands: Bromium has running through it a tendency to infiltrate the glands. The glands become bard, but seldom suppurate. They generally remain hard. The glands of the neck, the parotid, the sublingual, the submaxillary, are enormously enlarged and very hard.
The processes of inflammation are slow; they are not that rapid, violent kind like we find in Bell. and Merc.
"Parts that inflame infiltrate, becoming hard."
Inflammation with hardness is the idea. It has been very useful in ulcers with this infiltration; very useful in enlarged glands with great hardness, without any tendency to suppurate.
Glands take on tuberculosis, and tissues take on tuberculosis. Glands that inflame for a while begin to take on a lower form of degeneration, a lower form of tissue making.
It is very similar to these enlarged, hard, scrofulous glands that we find in the neck; enlargement of the parotid and submaxillary. It has cured enlargement and great hardness of the thyroid gland.
Again, we have emaciation, and when we see the tendency to infiltration it is not strange that it has been a curative medicine in cancer and tuberculosis. There is weakness in this remedy. The legs become weak. Growing prostration, with tremulous limbs.
Twitching; tremulous weakness; fainting. In the catarrhal affections there is a formation, more or less, of membrane.
Membranous exudate is a natural course of events. A natural feature of the mucous membrane is infiltration, so that the mucous membrane appears to exude little grayish-white vegetations, and beneath them is induration.
That is true in ulcers, it is true in mucous membrane. And ulcer will form upon the mucous membrane and eat in, and build beneath it a hardened stratum of tissue.
It has febrile conditions along with these catarrhal states. Great nervous excitement. "Icy coldness of the limbs. "
"Heat of the head."
"Dyspnoea, with great sweating."
Croupy manifestations. Running through most of the complaints there is palpitation.
Mind: Palpitation with nausea, palpitation with headache, palpitation with various kinds of nervous excitement. So weak is be gradually becoming that he has an "aversion to every kind of work; to reading.
Takes no interest in household duties."
Becomes indifferent. Very tired.
"Great depression of spirits, Low spirited. Sad and discouraged." Anxiety with most complaints. Headaches from becoming overheated. "Noise in the ears.
Throbbing and burning in the ears."
And then the complaints of the glands that are so closely associated with the ears. With ear troubles, enlargement of the glands; the parotid becomes enlarged and bard.
Ear: Ear affections following scarlet fever, with discharges from the ears. Pains and aches; inflammation; abscess of the ear.
Suppuration of the parotid gland occasionally, but it is an exception.
"Swelling and hardness of the left parotid gland."
The ovaries, testes, etc., are all affected by Bromium.
Nose: Bleeding of the nose. Ulcerations in the nose. Catarrhal affections of the nose. Much sneezing.
Acute coryza, violent, with much burning in the nose, and a sensation of coldness, as if the mucous membrane of the nose were cold from inhaling cold air.
It is useful for June cold, with the first hot weather in June, or if the first hot weather comes in July. Violent coryza once a year, during the hot season. Fluent coryza, with headaches.
"The nose is sore and the wings of the nose swell. Scurf forms on it, with pain and bleeding on wiping it."
Rawness round about the nostrils.
Face: A Bromium patient is one that is likely to have flushed face, especially those due to acute Bromium conditions.
"Flushed face."
He becomes heated easily. But this is entirely the opposite of the chronic constitutional Bromium condition.
That is true with a good many remedies, especially many of the antipsorics. The old sickly broken-down constitutions, those needing Bromium for chronically enlarged glands, for goitre, for cancerous affections, will have the "gray, earthy color of the face.
Oldish appearance."
It is a sickly face, an ash-colored face.
"Face ashy gray."
Then again we have children that are plethoric, with red face, easily overheated. Of course, when the acute condition is on and the breathing has been that of dyspnoea for several hours or many days, then the
patient becomes cyanotic, gasping for breath, and choking, the face becomes ashy pale, as it is in diphtheria, in croup, and in laryngeal affections.
"Stony, hard swelling of glands, especially of the lower jaw and throat."
Throat: We find that repeated in many divisions of the subject. Many of the throat complaints that are laid down in Bromium begin in the larynx and creep up into the throat.
Some of them begin in the throat and go down into the larynx; but the two are so closely associated in Bromium that both are likely to be affected; so that diphtheria spreads from one to the other. Diphtheria begins in the throat and goes into the larynx.
Bromium fits the most malignant type of diphtheria. The membrane grows like a weed, shuts off breathing, closes up the larynx, So severe are the cases, that though be has been sick but two or three days and even when Bromium has mastered the case, the patient is left with great prostration. All those that belong to Bromium are of that type.
Great violence; great prostration. Extremely sick, and with deathly weakness. A great many of the cures that have been performed in the throat have been left sided diphtheria, yet it has cured both sides. You will very seldom see Bromium develop in cold dry weather; but in hot damp weather Bromium cases come on; affections in the spring, and in the fall and summer.
Stomach: The chronic cases that will need Bromium are such as have ulcers of the stomach. Suspicious ulcers in the stomach, and suspicious symptoms about the stomach.
Vomiting like coffee grounds, and vomiting with signs of ulceration. Aggravation after eating; either vomiting, or diarrhoea. Cannot take acids. Diarrhoea or cough worse after eating, or after acids.
"After eating oysters, diarrhoea, and a disordered stomach.
Worse from the slightest inhalation of tobacco smoke.
Vomiting of bloody mucus.
Eructations.
" Foul stomach. Pain in the stomach from warm things, from hot tea, hot drinks. "
It is a common feature when there is ulcer in the stomach or when the mucous membrane is about to ulcerate, that hot drinks are intolerable.
"Pains from taking hot foods."
Stools and rectum: In studying the stool and rectum symptoms we find exudation. Membranous formations pass in the stool. Diarrheic stool with membrane.
"Black, fecal stool.” Diarrhoea; must go to stool after eating."
We have running through the remedy enlarged veins. These are found also in the rectum. Hemorrhoids protrude from the rectum, burning. Smarting day and night.
"Blind, intensely painful varices, with black, diarrheic stools.
Blind, painful hemorrhoids," and hemorrhoids that protrude.
"Haemorrhoids during and after stool."
During the stool the rectum is painful from hemorrhoidal tumors.
Genitals: Swelling and induration of the left testicle. Notice the left sidedness, the left side of the throat, and the left testicle. Then, again, dull pain in the region of the left ovary.
"Constant dull pain in the ovary; with swelling and hardness."
There is the same induration of the left ovary. It does seem strange that some medicines single out more particularly the left organs and the left side of the body. Like Lach. in many instances it picks out the left side of the body.
A great many remedies show a preference for one side of the body; the glands in this remedy are more affected upon the left side of the body than the right.
"Swelling of the ovarian region before and during menses."
Suppression of the menses. Loud emission of flatus from the vagina.
Larynx: In the larynx it has produced more symptoms than in any other part of the body. It produces a raw, sore feeling in the larynx from inhaled air.
"Rawness in the larynx. Loss of voice. Hoarseness from overheating."
From too much clothing on a warm day, or from keeping on an overcoat in a room that is heated; coming out into the air he cools off. He has laryngitis.
"Tickling in the larynx," keeping up a constant coughing.
Scraping and rawness in the larynx. Scraping mucus from the larynx, scraping and coughing. It is not a hawk, because that noise clears the throat.
Every medical should go through all the noises he hears others make, and try and observe as much as possible what feeling is accompanied with that noise, so that he can put himself in the other's place.
Each one is accompanied with its own sound, and the instant you hear it you realize the exact place he is drawing mucus from and just where the irritation is.
If you allow the patient to describe it he always calls it by the wrong name. The patient knows very little about this part except that it is the throat, and if he is drawing mucus from the throat, or scraping it from the larynx, he always calls it the throat.
But the physician must waive all that and observe as to sound. So let each one go alone by himself and make all these noises that he bears people make, and then realize for himself what part it is he is scraping.
It may seem ludicrous, but how else will you learn about it? It is just as important to figure out these sounds as it is to figure out what a child needs by its sounds and motions. It is impossible to get the symptoms and wants of a child except by interpreting its motions.
Every motion it makes indicates something. An astute observer, one who has been watching children for a number of years, will understand the child, and will hardly have to ask the mother a question. He will know
at once where the child is sick by what it does.
The child is like the animal. You never have to ask a horse or dog where he feels pain, because he will always tell by his motions. So does the infant.
The hoarseness comes on after being overheated. Remember that. "Rough, dry cough; pain in the larynx.” jumping up for want of breath. "Gasping and suffering for breath, with wheezing and rattling in larynx. Sensation as if air passages were full of smoke."
Now we have all these rough sounds; rough breathing; croupy breathing; rasping breathing different ways of describing different forms of croup.
You cannot individualize a remedy by these because one child will croup in one pitch, and another will croup in another; but to get at the constitution of the child and the mother is the important point.
"Voice hardly audible." "Spasm in the glottis."
In the croupy condition it is really a membranous formation upon the inflamed surface, very often extending downward through the trachea into the bronchial tubes, and producing a croupous pneumonia.
Bromium has that in its nature. But without any membranous formation at all Bromium constricts the larynx. It has constriction of the larynx; just like a clutching, a spasm.
"Tickling in the larynx, with irritation to cough. Scraping and rawness in the larynx. Sensation of coldness in the larynx."
That is a very peculiar symptom with Bromium. In laryngitis, where the patient says the feeling is as if it was covered with down.
I have heard them describe it as if it was covered with velvet, but it feels so cold. The air breathed, feels cold, just like it was the air blown off from snow or ice.
Sensation of coldness in the larynx.
"Constant sore pain in the larynx."
This means that the larynx is painful to touch. Phos., Bell., and Rumex have soreness in the larynx, sore to touch; but the Bromium soreness is commonly below the larynx and in the throat pit as well.
"Sensation as if the air tubes were full of smoke."
Some patients, will describe that as sulphur fumes, or as of smoke from tar. After the first few hours mucus begins to accumulate in the larynx and trachea, and a constant expectoration keeps up, of a whitish thick mucus, and he coughs and scrapes the larynx constantly, and there is no peace.
This is often present in laryngitis without any membranous formation. Bromium is not given as often as it is indicated in voicelessness, in irritation of the larynx, in rawness of the larynx because it is uncommon for persons to have laryngitis and hoarseness in the larynx from being overheated.
Many of those cases would be cured promptly by Bromium. But where it is thought of by the routine prescriber is where there is croup or diphtheria.
That was never taught by Hahnemann.
"Much rattling of mucus in the larynx.
Inspiration very difficult.
Larynx drawn down."
This would take place in croup, after the formation of the membrane.
"Cough hoarse, crowing, suffocative; breathing sawing, whistling.
Spasms of the larynx; suffocative cough.
Membranous formation in larynx and trachea.
Croupous inflammation formed by exuberant growth of fungi."
"Asthma of sailors as soon as they go ashore; relieved again as soon as they are at sea.
Difficult breathing with rattling throughout the chest. Bronchitis and pneumonia. Bromium is often the remedy when whooping cough is prevailing in the spring, towards the hot weather, and membranes form in the larynx.
The cough gets immediately worse from dust. Handling old books from the shelf aggravates. Sneezing, hoarseness, irritation in the respiratory tract from picking up and handling dusty things.
"Cough, with sudden paroxysms of suffocation on swallowing."
Bromium is full of catarrhal conditions, especially of the breathing apparatus. It has hepatization of the lungs; infiltration is one of its most natural features.
Bryonia Alba
Generalities: Every medicine has a sphere of action, a peculiar nature whereby it differs from all other medicines, and hence it becomes suitable to complaints of one class and not suitable to those of another.
It is like the nature of human beings, as they differ from each other, and also like the nature of diseases, which differ from each other in character.
We study a remedy also in regard to its velocity and continuance, its remittence or intermittence.
The symptoms of some remedies come on suddenly, with great violence, with great rapidity, stay but a short time in their paroxysm, and go off as it nothing had happened.
Others come on slowly, are deep acting and continuous, like the continued fevers. We notice the complaints of Ignatia, how flitting and intermittent and unexpected everything is; we notice in Aconite how complaints come on with violence, and in Belladonna with what suddenness they come on.
When we come to the study of Bryonia we find it is a most persistent remedy; its complaints develop slowly, i.e., slowly for acute conditions.
Its complaints are continuous, remittent, and only occasionally intermittent.
They increase into violence, but the violence is not the first flash as in Aconite or Belladonna, and hence it conforms to a type of disease with continued fever; to rheumatisms that come with gradually increasing severity, gradually increasing and involving one joint after another, until all the white fibrous tissues are ina state of inflammation, pain and distress.
It has inflammatory conditions anywhere about the body, but particularly of the fibrous tissues, serous membranes, ligaments of joints and aponeuroses. It also affects the coating of nerves with its congestions, and these gradually increase in severity.
From the beginning there are present the characteristic features, and it may be seen that this patient is coming down with a Bryonia sickness.
The patient has several days of preparation. He does not feel very well, is languid and tired, does not want to be spoken to, does not want to move, and this gradually increases; pains begin to flit over the body, they move around here and there over the fibres in one place and another, and every time he moves the pain increase, until they end in a steady and continuous pain. The parts become hot and inflamed, and at last he is down with rheumatism.
The complaints come on after taking cold, not the first few hours, as in Aconite or Bell., but the day after an exposure he begins to feel uneasy and he sneezes and the nose discharges, there is rawness in the chest, and in a day or so he has a chill and comes down with some inflammatory trouble, pneumonia or pleurisy.
Its inflammatory complaints include inflammation of the membranes of the brain, sometimes extending, into the cord; the pleural membranes, the peritoneum and the heart covering, these are the most common; it also has inflammation of organs.
When these conditions come on there is noticed, very early in the case, even before the pains begin, an aversion to motion, and the patient does not know why, but finally he observes that his symptoms are made worse if he has to move, so that the slightest inclination to move is resisted with a feeling of anger, and when he does move he finds he is aroused to great suffering, and that all the aches and pains of the body come on.
Thus we have the well-known Bryonia aggravation from motion. This runs all through the remedy.
This medicine is suitable in a great many diseases, diseases of a typhoid nature, diseases that take ona symptomatic typhoid, diseases that start out as remittents and run into a continued fever, as in pneumonia, pleurisy, inflammation of the liver, of glands, of the bowels, etc.
It may be a gastro-enteritis or peritonitis, or inflammation of the bowels, with the sensitiveness, the aggravation from motion and the desire to keep perfectly still. Inflammation of joints, whether of rheumatic character or not, whether from cold, exposure or injury.
Bryonia is often indicated in injuries of joints where Arnica would be a failure.
There is an extreme state of irritability in Bryonia; every word which compels him to answer a question or to think will aggravate him.
The effort to talk will be attended with horror. At the beginning of complaints you go to the bedside of a patient who has been grumbling a few days; something is evidently coming on; the family meet you at the door and say,
"The patient is almost unconscious;"
you look at him, the face is puffed and purplish, he seems to be dazed, there appears to be a short of venous stasis all over the body, but especially about the face; his countenance is almost that of an imbecile, yet he is perfectly capable of talking, although he has an aversion to it and appears to outsiders to ignore everything that is said.
This sometimes comes on apparently in a short time; the patient awakens in the morning with a dull, congestive headache and a stupid feeling in the head; dulness of mind so that he cannot work, and this feeling gradually increases; such a state is sometimes the forerunner of a serious illness.
We find, when a pneumonia or inflammation of the liver, or some slow insidious inflammation is coming on somewhere in the body, but not yet located, that this state will begin in the morning.
This is peculiar about the aggravation of Bryonia - its troubles commence many times early in the morning. On waking, with the first move, he realizes that things are not all right, there is a state of stupidity bordering on unconsciousness.
Those who have been grumbling for a week or ten days wake up in the morning feeling miserable, some time that night or the next day they have to send for the doctor. If this is watched for a few days, a continued fever is observed.
Or at night a chill will come on, with much pain in the chest, rusty expectoration, short, dry cough and other symptoms that will be spoken of under Bryonia later, showing that the trouble is going towards the chest; or the condition may gradually increase as a congestive, dull headache.
This will be seen when congestion of the brain is coming on. Bryonia sickness often picks out plethoric subjects, those who are venous in their make up, those who, when suffering with cold, come down with catarrhal congestions.
Catarrhal fever may be covered by Bryonia.
Mind: This sluggish state of the mind then is the state of Bryonia, not an excitable state, as in Coffea, Nux vomica, Ignatia, but sluggish aggravated from motion, aggravated from being talked to; wants to lie still in bed; very great irritability, which is as extreme as that found in Nux or Chamomilla.
It also has acute complaints aggravated from anger, from being aroused, from being disturbed, from controversy. Following the early sluggishness, there is later a state of complete stupefaction in Bryonia, in
which he becomes quite unconscious, as in typhoid.
He goes from a state of partial unconsciousness to one of complete unconsciousness, as in hydrocephalic children.
In rheumatic complaints, in pneumonia, and in typhoid conditions, when he is aroused from this stage of stupefaction he is confused, sees images, thinks he is away from home and wants to be taken home.
Sometimes he will lie and say nothing but that he "wants to go home."
The delirium is of a low type; it is not the flashing wild excitement of Bell. or Stram.; it is the very opposite; he talks and wanders and does not say much unless he is disturbed. You disturb him and lie says,
"Go away and let me go home,” and if you let him alone he will relapse into a perfectly quiet state and seldom speak.
"Irrational talk or prattle of his business, aggravated after 3 P.M." Usually you will find the delirium commencing about 9 P.M., and keeping up all night like the fever.
The acute mental state you will find manifesting its symptoms on rising in the morning, but as the febrile state advances and takes possession of him the symptoms will take on a 9 P.M. aggravation; those who have chill will have it at 9 P.M.; in those who have a fever, the fever will come at 9 P.M.
If mental symptoms are uppermost they increase and spread over the night. It has a 3 P- M aggravation. Bell. will begin at 3 and run on towards midnight, but Bryonia will begin at 9 P.M. and run on through the night.
The aggravation of the Chamomilla patients, who are also extremely irritable, is at g AIM. Sometimes we go to the bedside and can hardly distinguish between Bryonia and Cham. because they are both so spunky, but the Cham. baby is worse at 9 A.M. and the Bryonia baby is worse at 9 P.M.
in Bryonia there is a key-note which really applies to a dozen or more remedies,
"he wants something and he knows not what."
It is a very important symptom of Bryonia. It is a symptom that calls for Bryonia only when the rest of the symptoms agree. You go to a child who is being carried in the arms of the nurse and wants one toy after another; you get the toy he wants and he does not want it and will throw it back at you.
When that case is looked into thoroughly it may be covered by Kreosote; another is never satisfied with anything and rejects everything he asks for; you look into that case and it may be covered by Chamomilla.
"Desire for things that cannot be had which are refused, or not wanted when offered." "Apprehensiveness; fearfulness." "Anxiety in whole body compelled him to do something constantly."
There is a feature worthy of consideration because it sometimes makes a case appear inconsistent. It is due to his anxiety that pervades the whole body.
In Bryonia as in Arsenic there comes an anxious and uneasy feeling which compels him to move, but he is worse from motion, yet so uneasy and anxious that he must move.
There are pains so violent that he cannot keep still, and yet when he moves he screeches from the pain. So it is really not an inconsistency but simply due to the great violence of the pain. Even though he knows that the motion is going to make him worse, he cannot keep still, for the pain is so violent.
Early in the case he was able to keep still, and found that he was better from keeping still, and that the mental state was better from keeping still, and that the anxious restlessness increased the more be moved, until finally a reaction comes and he is obliged to move.
You would think, looking at the case superficially, that that patient is better from motion as in Rhus tox., but in Rhus you find that the patient moves and in moving he gets feeble, and when he sits down the pains begin to come on again.
There is the distinction between the two, and yet they look alike if not examined into carefully. It is common for Bryonia to be ameliorated from cool air, and from cool applications.
Now, if he moves, he gets warmed up, the pains are worse, but there are rheumatic complaints of Bryonia which are better from heat, and under these circumstances he is better from continued motion.
It is another form of relief, and another of the modalities. | sometimes wonder whether Bryonia has a greater element of relief from heat, or greater element of relief from cold.
Most of the head complaints that are of a congestive character are better from cool applications, from cold air, etc. Yet there are some of the Bryonia head com plaints that are relieved by hot applications, and these seem to have no accompanying cerebral congestion.
So that Bryonia has opposite modalities, but in all its opposite states there is still a grand nature running all through, sufficient to detect it.
In a damp climate Bryonia is one of the most frequently indicated remedies, but in the clear climates, where the thermometer runs low, Aconite will be indicated more than Bryonia.
Still further South, the complaints assume more of the constitutional state of Gelsemium in inflammatory conditions. We know in the far North the sudden, violent cold brings on violent colds like Aconite, while here the complaints are more insidious, like Bryonia, land further South.
These atmospheric changes should be thoroughly considered in relation to our Materia Medica. The mental state of Bryonia is usually relieved from cool air, he wants the windows open.
Anxiety, confusion of mind, fear, etc., are ameliorated from being cool. Sometimes the delirium, and the congestive fullness of the head affecting the mind, will increase if the room becomes very warm, or from the heat of the stove, from becoming heated, or from warm covers.
In children this will be noticed, whereas if the window be thrown up to relieve the stuffiness of the room the child will sleep quietly. Such remedies as Bryonia, Apis, Pulsatilla, and many others, come in here.
If you go into a room and find the child raging with delirium, turning and tossing, and the mother is trying to keep the room warm because she is chilly, and you say,
"Why, how stuffy it is in here!" and you open the window and then notice that the child goes off to sleep, do not overlook that; because that relief was caused by something.
There should be nothing that can possibly occur to a patient, but that you should solve the meaning of before you leave the room. Settle in your mind as to what it was that caused it.
"Fear of death."
Full of fear, anxiety, despair of recovery, great despondency. Both mental and bodily quietness is required, that is, he wants to keep still.
Often he wants the room dark. It has complaints from getting excited. Bryonia patients are nearly always worse from visitors.
"Morose."
Do not cross a Bryonia patient for it makes him worse.
"Bad effects from mortification.”
"Ailments arising from chagrin; " these are headaches usually.
Violent, congestive headaches that come on a few hours after altercation or controversy, or little misunderstandings with somebody that he cannot talk back to, will be covered by Staph., but Bryonia also has that.
Staph. is suited to irritable, violent, nervous, excitable people, that get into violent altercation or dispute. If a headache comes on, such a patient may need Bryonia.
If in a chronic state a patient says,
"Doctor, if I ever have a dispute with a man over anything I come down with nervous excitement, sleeplessness, headaches;"
you do not have to work long upon that case, because more than likely Staph. will be suitable.
Bryonia has dizziness; the dizziness is worse in a warm room. You will notice, as I go through, that in everything of a nervous nature, nervous excitement, and commonly the bodily state, the patient is worse from a warm room, worse from too much clothing, worse from the warmth of the bed, wants the windows open, wants to breathe fresh, cool air.
He suffers more than ordinary persons, from a stuffy room. Persons who are subject to Bryonia conditions in church, at the opera, in close warm rooms, like Lycopodium. Girls that faint every time they go to church are relieved by Ignatia.
Head: We commence now with the study of the head.
The head complaints may be looked upon as striking features of the remedy, because there is pain in the head with almost every acute complaint.
Headaches are associated with inflammatory and congestive complaints.
The mental dullness and confusion of the mind is spoken of with the congestive headache, and bursting headache.
The head feels so full she wants to press it with the hand, or tic it up; tight pressure, over the whole skull, is grateful. The headaches are worse in a warm room and commonly worse from heat.
Sometimes superficial neuralgias have relief from local heat, but a warm room or a close room is very distressing to the Bryonia headache. Headaches as if the skull would split open; the pains are worse from every motion, even the winking motion of the eyes, the motion necessary to talking and the effort of thinking so that all exertion of body or mind becomes impossible with a severe headache.
Must keep perfectly quiet. Sometimes lying down and keeping perfectly quiet in a dark room will give some relief. Light aggravates; if you think a moment you will see that the accommodation to light and shadow of a room involves motion; it is said that the light aggravates, but even here it is the motion that is carried on by the muscles of accommodation.
The headaches of Bryonia are very commonly the forerunner of other complaints, congestion of the lungs, bronchitis, congestion of some other part of the body; he wakes up in the morning with headache; if it be coryza that is coming, he has the headache in the morning and through the day he commences to sneeze; or if the trouble is in some other part of the body, before the symptoms develop, he wakes up in the morning with this congestive headache over the eyes or in the back of the head, or both; it seems as if the head would burst; better from pressure, worse from the warmth of the room, and worse from every motion.
Headache over the eyes, sometimes like the stabbing of a knife, worse from the first motion. He realizes it on waking upon moving the eyes, with soreness in the eyeballs, with bruised feelings all over.
The motion of the arms, doing work with the arms as in various kinds of business that are carried on with the use of the arms and hands, is generally accompanied by complaints of the upper part of the body and especially the head, so that one of the old key-notes in the time of Hering was "complaints from ironing.".
You know that ironing is commonly carried on in a warm room, it involves the motion of the arms, and thus brings in two most striking features of Bryonia, so that this key-note is no longer an abstract statement; it is not to be considered apart from the general nature, but only serves to bring it out.
Splitting, violent congestive headaches; headaches as if everything would burst out of the forehead. Pressure pain in the forehead, fullness and heaviness in the forehead as if the brain were pressed out.
This fullness or congestion of the head, is accompanied by what was described as sluggishness of the mind, and it will often be noticed that the countenance is somewhat besotted.
The patient looks as if he were an imbecile. The face is mottled, and purple, with congestion in a marked Bryonia state. The eyes are red, and congested; he is listless, does not want to move, to speak, or to do anything, because all these things are motion, are efforts, and they make him worse.
You will see this is also true in Bell.; it has all of this congestion and pressure; but remember Bryonia is slow, sluggish, passive and insidious in its approach and progress, while in Bell. the mental symptoms and everything in connection are marked by activity. With the headaches there is more or less burning, and sometimes throbbing.
The throbbing is seldom felt until he moves. After any movement, like going up stairs, walking, or turning over in bed during the headache, he feels the violent throbbing; on keeping still a moment it settles down into a bursting, pressing pain as if the skull would be pressed open.
There are many other pains in connection with the Bryonia headache; in the text it is described: "tearing and stitching pains." "Shooting pains," sharp pains.
Some of the pressing pains are described as if a great weight were on the head, but the same idea prevails; it is an internal pressure; a sluggishness of the circulation in the brain, a stasis as if all the blood in the body were surging in the head.
"Stitches in the head."
"Splitting headache."
"Rush of blood to head." Threatened apoplexy.
"Headache after washing himself with cold water when face was sweating.” That is, taking cold from suppression of perspiration.
"Always on coughing, motion in head like pressure."
The headache is so bad in many cases of pneumonia or bronchitis, in fact in any of the inflammatory or congestive conditions, that very often you will see the patient grasp the head when he knows he is going to cough.
He holds his head because it hurts so from the action of coughing. Many remedies have this, but it is in keeping with the general aggravation of Bryonia from motion, from jar, from any effort.
"The headache is expanding, aggravated by the slightest motion; after eating."
The aggravation after eating is in keeping with the Bryonia state in general. The Patient himself, in all complaints, feels worse after eating. It hardly matters what the trouble is, it is worse after eating; the cough is worse after eating, the gouty, state is increased by eating.
The Bryonia patient will finally sum up the whole subject and say, "I am always worse after eating;" so that it becomes a general. The headaches are often accompanied by nose-bleed.
"Obstinate headache with constipation."
Bryonia is particularly suitable in venous, sluggish constitutions, with sluggish heart, poor circulation, yet apparently plethoric, apparently rugged, but subject to gouty exacerbations from change of weather.
Dandruff is common; sensitiveness and great soreness of the scalp worse from the slightest touch of the scalp, feels as if the hair were pulled; women must always have the hair hanging down. In the Bryonia headaches, as well as rheumatic attacks, if he can perspire a freely, he will get relief.
Eyes: Bryonia is ameliorated in all its complaints as soon as the perspiration becomes free and general. Catarrhal conditions of the eyes are found in Bryonia; it is not so often thought of as an inflammatory remedy for the eyes when there are no other symptoms, but eye symptoms will be found, redness, inflammation, congestion, heat, enlargement of the veins, burning and smarting, associated with headaches, with coryza, with troubles in the air passages, bronchitis, etc.
Sore aching in the eyes, the eyeballs can hardly be touched, so tender to touch, as if bruised, increased from coughing or pressure.
Such conditions come with chest complaints, with colds and headaches.
"Soreness and aching of eyes when moving them.”
"Pressing, crushing pains in eyes."
"Inflammation of eyes and lips, especially in new-born infants."
Think of Bryonia when gouty conditions have left certain parts and all at once the eyes are affected, tumefaction of the lids, the conjunctiva looks like raw beef, so highly inflamed is it, red and oozing blood. You find out that a few days before the patient, an old gouty subject, had rheumatic attacks of the joint, and
now he has sore and inflamed eyes.
"Rheumatic iritis, caused by cold."
Rheumatic inflammation of the eyes, i. e., in inflammatory conditions and congestion with redness, associated more or less with gouty affections. In olden times it was described as "arthritic sore eyes," which Means sore eyes in a gouty constitution,
Nose: Many of the complaints of Bryonia commence in the nose; sneezing, coryza, running at the nose, red eyes, lachrymation, aching through the nose, eyes and head the first day; then the trouble goes down into the posterior nares, the throat, the larynx, with hoarseness, and then a bronchitis comes on, and if not checked it goes into pneumonia and pleurisy, so that the trouble has traveled from the beginning of the respiratory tract, the nose, to the lung tissue.
This is a field for the complaints of Bryonia. All are worse from motion, all parts are subject to a good deal of burning and congestion; more or less fever, sometimes intense fever; the patient himself worse from the slightest motion and wants to keep still; dullness of mind, pressive, congestive headaches; sore, lame and bruised all over, often worse at 9 o'clock in the evening; increased dullness of the mind after sleep or on waking in the morning.
The cough comes on with great violence, racking the whole body and increasing the headache, and with copious discharge of mucus from the respiratory tract.
" - "
Frequent sneezing. "Sneezing between coughs." "Loss of smell."
Bleeding from the nose in these congestions, or with coryzas. During menstruation there is epistaxis, congestion of the head is present at this menstrual period. Epistaxis appears as a vicarious flow in cases of amenorrhoea. If the menstrual flow should be checked suddenly from cold, nosebleed comes on. Dryness in the nose.
Face: The aspect of the face is important; the besotted, purple, bloated countenance is not dropsically bloated, although it has the oedematous face sometimes, but puffed from vascular stasis, not pitting upon pressure; swollen and puffed, purple, with a doltish state of the mind, as if he were drunk.
He will took at you and wonder what you were doing, and what you said; a stupefaction of the intellect; the eyes do not look at you intelligently. When a patient is about to come down with some Bryonia complaint, with a remittent, or with head congestions, or pneumonia, or some other respiratory disease, the family will notice when he awakes in the morning that he has that besotted expression, and he says he has to make such an effort to think or do anything, and his head aches hard, and is worse from motion. Or the face is red and burning,
"red spots on the face and neck;" "hot, bloated, red face."
In children, as well as adults, there is gradually increasing cerebral trouble, dilated pupils, besotted countenance, and continual lateral motion of the lower jaw.
This motion of the jaw in a congestive attack is a strong feature of Bryonia. It is not the grinding of the teeth so much that I refer to now, although that is found in Bryonia, but a lateral movement of the jaw as if chewing, but the teeth do not come in contact and they keep it up night and day.
A great many remedies have grinding of the teeth. When intermittent fever comes on with marked congestion, stupefaction of the intellect, violent rigors, even to a congestive chill, the patient lying in stupefaction or a semi-conscious state, without grinding the teeth, yet wagging the jaw back and forth by the hour, Bryonia is often suitable.
Constant motion of the mouth as if the patient were chewing, in brain affections of children; it occurs in little ones when there are no teeth; but they keep up a chewing motion.
In regard to the lips and lower part of the face, that bloated, swollen condition, the sluggish circulation, a venous congestion or stasis will be found in Bryonia, making the aspect as of one long intoxicated; it is not so marked as in Baptisia and is not accompanied by so low a state, so advanced a stupor, as in Baptisia.
Great dryness of the lips; the lips parched and dry. "Children pick the lips," "Lips cracked and bleeding."
Lips parched, dry and bleeding, such as will be seen in typhoid states, where the whole mouth is dry and brown, cracked, parched and bleeding; dry, brown tongue. Sordes on the teeth.
In Arum triphyllum, there is marked picking of the nose and lips; they pick and pick and bore the finger into the nose.
Toothache: Bryonia has toothache, worse from warmth.
"Tearing, stitching toothache while eating;” from warm drinks, from warm foods, worse in a warm-worn, wants cold foods in the mouth, wants to be in cold air, but worse from motion.
"Toothache > by cold water or lying on painful side." Pressing hard upon the painful tooth ameliorate it. "Toothache < from smoking."
You see how the relief from cold and aggravation from heat go along with us; we shall keep reiterating these modalities that affect the patient as a general state, and we shall see as we go through that nearly all his symptoms are worse from motion, worse from heat, etc.
He keeps on telling us they are better from pressure in each region we go over, until, finally we come to the conclusion that they are general.
We may have in two remedies the same set of symptoms, and yet they are all made worse from all the opposite things.
Thus you see modalities indicate and contraindicate remedies. This is the studying of remedies by their modalities, for modalities sometimes constitute strong generals.
Taste: You will not be surprised to know that Bryonia loses his sense of taste, so that if he has a coryza nothing tastes natural.
Not only is there mental sluggishness, but there is a slowing down of his sensations, his whole state is benumbed.
"Taste flat, insipid, pasty"
His intelligence is so affected that he does not know where be is even, thinks he is away from home, and even his tongue is no longer intelligent; so that something that is sour tastes as though bitter; his senses deceive him.
"Tongue thickly coated white."
In typhoid, in cerebral congestion, in sore throat, in pneumonia, in all diseases of the respiratory apparatus, in rheumatic affections, the tongue is thickly coated.
"Dry, and bleeding and covered with crusts."
Such a tongue is found in typhoid fever, a dry, brown, cracked, bleeding tongue. When he takes a cold the mouth becomes dry. It is very common for the Bryonia patient to have great thirst; he is apt to drink large quantities of water, at wide intervals.
With this dry, brown tongue, however, he loses his taste for water and does not want it; dry mouth and thirstless like Nux moshata.
"Aphthae"
"Bad odor from mouth."
Throat: Bryonia has nondescript sore throats, with stitching pains, with dryness, with parched appearance of the throat, and thirst for large, quantities of water at long intervals.
"Constitutional tendency to aphthous formations in the throat,” little white spots in the throat.
Desires and aversions: Then we come to the desires and aversions that relate to the stomach, and they are greatly perverted. He is worse from eating. The stomach has lost its ability to digest, and hence he has an aversion to all food.
"Desires things immediately, and when offered they are refused."
He is changeable, does not know what he wants. He craves in the mind the things he has an aversion to in the stomach.
When he sees it he does not want it. His intelligence is in a state of confusion. He craves acids.
"Great thirst day and night;" he wants cold water. "Thirst for large quantities at long intervals."
Many remedies want to sip water all the time. In Bryonia the large quantities relieve the thirst immediately. In Arsenic the drink does not relieve, he wants a little and wants it often.
The stomach complaints of Bryonia are relieved from warm drinks that becomes a particular because his desire is for cold drinks, but his stomach is better from warm drinks.
In his fever and head complaints and febrile states he wants cold things, which often bring on and increase the cough and pains, but the hot drink, which he does not crave, relieves the stomach and bowel complaints.
In the chill, Bryonia often has desire for ice-cold water, which chills him dreadfully; and hot water relieves. "Desire for cold and acid drinks."
Aversion to rich fat food; all greasy things.
"Desire for things which are not to be bad.”
When patients are under constitutional remedies, they need caution about certain kinds of foods that are known to disagree with their constitutional remedy. A Bryonia patient is often made sick from eating sauerkraut, from vegetable salads, chicken salad, etc., so that you need not be surprised after administering a dose of Bryonia for a constitutional state, to have your patient come in and say she has been made very ill from eating some one of these things.
It is well to caution persons who are under the influence of Puls. To avoid the use of fat foods, because very often they will upset the action of the remedy. It is well to say to patients who are under Lyc.
"See that you do not eat oysters while taking this medicine."
These medicines are known to produce states in the stomach inimical to certain kinds of foods; certain remedies have violently inimical relation to acids, lemons, etc.
If you do not particularly mention the fact, and say,
"You must not touch vinegar or lemons; nor take, lemon juice while taking this medicine," you will have the remedy spoiled, and then wonder why it is.
The medicine often stops acting and the patient gets a disordered condition of the stomach and bowels a medicine that should act for a long time ceases action and you do I not know what the trouble is.
Homoeopathy will rule out such things as are inimical to the remedies and inimical to patients in general, or do not agree with a particular constitution.
To have an iron-clad rule is not correct practice; the only iron-clad rule is to be sure that the remedy is similar to the patient when you administer it, and the things that he is to have are to be in agreement with that remedy.
It is not an uncommon thing for a patient who has been under the influence of Rhus tox., and has been doing well up to a certain time, after he has taken a bath, to have his symptoms return in the form of a Rhus state; the action of the remedy stops right there.
He must of course take a bath, and yet it is true that some constitutional cases under Rhus must stop taking their ordinary bath, in order to keep themselves under the influence of Rhus. It is the same with Calcarea, a bath will often stop the action.
I only speak of these things to impress upon you the importance of feeding and treating, your patient in accordance with the remedy; in accordance with a principle and not by rule; do not have one list of foods for your patients; do not have a list of things for everybody. There is nothing in Homoeopathy.
The patient himself in all the strange and peculiar things is worse from eating; the cough is worse from eating, the complaints of the head, the headaches, are worse from eating, and the respiration is worse from eating.
The stomach is distended with wind after eating, but especially after oysters. Oysters are not, asa rule, a dangerous article of diet, yet some are poisoned by oysters.
"Worse after eating or drinking."
When the case is one of whooping cough, the cough is worse, the paroxysms are more violent and all the symptoms are worse a little while after eating, but later, when digestion is finished and the stomach is empty, he is much relieved.
The Bryonia patient is ordinarily relieved from drinking, but if, when overheated, he drinks cold water, all of his rheumatic symptoms are worse, the cough is worse, and the headache is worse.
He will have a violent headache after drinking cold water when heated. In Rhus patients complaints are worse from drinking cold water when heated. The headache increases into a throbbing and bursting pain tenfold greater than it was before drinking.
The Bryonia patient is subject to hiccough, to belching, to nausea and vomiting, so that disordered stomach is the general term.
Bitter eructations, bitter nauseous taste. He vomits bile. After eating all these things are increased. In the stomach and abdomen we have a great many symptoms resulting from disordered stomach, or from taking cold, or from becoming overheated, or from drinking ice water when overheated.
Disordered stomach; irritation of the stomach so that he cannot eat without extreme pain, and this increases until the inflammatory condition involves the whole stomach and abdomen, and there is sensitiveness to pressure, and it can be diagnosed as a gastro-enteritis, with the soreness and tenderness, stitching, burning pains, all worse from motion; nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, tympanitic abdomen unable to move because it so increases the pain.
With the exception of the abdominal and stomach pains, the Bryonia pains are better from pressure.
The Bryonia patient with these inflammatory conditions will often be seen lying perfectly quiet in bed with the knees drawn up; lying with the limbs flexed in order to relax the abdominal muscles; he does not want to be talked to, does not want to think; every movement is painful, and increases the fever and often causes alternation of chilliness with heat; high fever.
The Bryonia patient, when lying perfectly quiet, is sometimes quite free from nausea, but the instant the head is raised from the pillow the dreadful sickness returns, so that he cannot sit up.
He cannot be raised up in bed because of the nausea, and if he persists in rising tip the nausea comes on more than ever, with burning in the stomach. With every motion he gulps up a little mucus and slime, which is putrid.
Stomach: All sorts of pains are felt in the stomach and bowels, but most particularly stitching and burning pains; feels as if the stomach would burst, as if the abdomen would burst. Peritoneal exudations. Awful soreness.
Sensitiveness of the pit. of the stomach, and sensitiveness Over the whole abdomen. This is commonly relieved by heat, although the patient himself wants to lie in a cool room.
The heat of the room is oppressive, yet beat applied is agreeable. Every inspiration, every motion of the chest greatly aggravates these pains, so that you will find a Bryonia patient shortening’ up his breathing instead of breathing deep. He keeps that up until he cannot stand it any longer, and then he takes a long breath that causes groaning.
Gastric inflammatory affections and disordered stomach, gastric affections in young girls from suppression of the menstrual flow, gastritis, gastroenteritis.
Bryonia has inflammation of the liver and many other liver symptoms. The liver, especially the right lobe, lies in the hypochondrium like a load, with soreness and tenderness to pressure, and he cannot move.
Every motion, every touch, every deep breath causes pain in this organ, as in the abdominal viscera. The breathing is short, quick, and when followed by, taking a deep breath it causes pain through the liver; it burns and stitches. With this, he has the disordered stomach, nausea and retching worse from motion; spitting up of bile. Stitching pains, sticking pains and burning in the liver.
"Transient stitches in right hypochondrium;" these are in the liver.
When he coughs it feels as if the liver or right hypochondrium would burst. Severe pains when coughing.
Stools and rectum: Bryonia furnishes many symptoms in connection with the stool and rectum. It has constipation, and it has dysentery. The pathogenesis is full of these conditions as well as many symptoms relating to the parts themselves. In the constipation the stool is dry and hard, as if burnt. No desire for stool, but after going many days there are passages of little hard pieces as if they had been burned.
No moisture about the parts, no mucus to often the hard stools. Any mucus that may be present will be discharged separately. Some times the stool is composed of little hard particles looking as if burned, at times scanty, again quite a lot, and then will follow the passage of mucus, as if lying about the mass of faeces was quite a lot of mucus.
In most inveterate constipations Bryonia is sometimes suit able. It has also diarrhoea that drives the patient out of bed in the morning; i.e., on first beginning to move in bed he begins to feel nauseated, he is bloated and distended with colic, and he has urging to go to stool; or a little while after getting up and moving about the bowel is distended causing colic, and be must hurry to stool.
The purgation is sometimes enormous, frequent, and no sooner does the patient finish than he is perfectly exhausted, lies down like one almost dead, covered with sweat; so tremendously fatigued he can hardly reach the vessel the next time, and then it comes a gushing, copious, bilious stool. If, while lying, he makes the least motion, he must hurry to stool.
Bryonia cures dysentery with all the tormina and tenesmus possible to imagine, with pain in the abdomen; with bloody and mucous discharges. In the constipation the straining is often ineffectual. He has urging to stool and goes several times before there is any result. The stool seems to remain in the rectum, although he seems to be compelled to strain; there is inactivity and inability to strain.
Ordinarily he has plenty of power and is quite likely to have a passage, but it is so dry. Bryonia has another kind of diarrhoea. It is like the yellow corn meal mush. just such a stool as this you will find in the typhoid patient, a yellow, mushy stool.
This is sometimes intermingled with mucus and slime, sometimes with blood. It may be useful to the physician to, know whether this is in the typhoid state or in the form of chronic diarrhoea. Bryonia has cured many cases of chronic diarrhoea where this yellow, mushy discharge was present, and frequent; several times a day, but more frequent in the morning.
Sometimes he has several stools in the morning that will satisfy for the whole twenty-four hours, or only one or two in the afternoon and five or six in the morning; during the night no stools at all, because when be keeps quiet in bed and comfortable he has not very much urging to stool; every motion or keep ing upon the feet increases the urging to stool.
So that some would think of it as a diarrhoea only in the day-time, and would associate it with Petroleum; but with Petroleum, no matter how much he moves about in the night, he will not have a stool, but will have all of the stools in the day-time. It says here:
"Diarrhoea putrid; smelling like old cheese."
"Very offensive."
"Brown, thin, faecal stools."
Some times chronic Bryonia patients will diet themselves, eating only thin liquids, avoiding solids, etc., and yet the food will come right through the next morning, almost undigested; lienteric stools.
"Urging followed by copious pasty evacuations." "Involuntary stools while asleep." "Burning of the anus with every passage."
This is especially at night if he moves, but motion is more common in the day-time, and every motion will bring on urging to stool.
Urines: There are plenty of urinary symptoms in this remedy; inflammatory condition of the kidneys; pinkish urinary deposits, uric acid crystals; urine profuse.
Whenever he strains himself in lifting, or any unusual motion, there is pain in the kidneys, a rousing up of congesting and long-lasting pain. It is a gouty constitution with kidney troubles, so that after overheating or overexertion he gets pain in the back.
"Pressure to urinate and involuntary discharge of urine."
"Burning in urethra, when not urinating; relieved by passing urine.
Female organs: There are many symptoms of the female sexual organs of great interest. Painful menstruation, dysmenorrhoea; pain in the ovaries at the menstrual period. Every menstrual period is associated with marked congestion of the ovaries, with sensitiveness to touch.
The sensitiveness at the approach of every menstrual period, in both groins, will be spoken of by the patient, increasing as the menstrual period comes on, until the soreness proceeds across the abdomen and meets, and then the whole abdomen is painful during the menstrual period.
The uterus is sore, the hypogastrium is tender. Inflammation of the uterus. Burning pain mostly in the body or fundus of the uterus.
The Bryonia patient is subject to amenorrhoea, or the flow is suppressed upon the slightest provocation. If she becomes overheated from exertion, such as from ironing or washing a few days before the menstrual period, it will be suppressed, and the next time she will have a harder time than ever.
In young plethoric women, after violent exertion, these complaints come on in that way. Violent exertion then scanty urine. Soreness of the abdomen, but the flow does not come, or is postponed a good many days after violent exertion; scanty urine and suppression of menses in plethoric girls.
From overexertion and becoming overheated, threatened abortion. In inflammation of the breasts and stopping of the milk flow in the lying in period. Bryonia must be consulted. In milk fever and pains and swelling of the breast Bryonia must be studied.
During confinement a woman becomes overheated and naturally perspires; just at the close of it as the
delivery takes place, if the nurse and the doctor do not observe and throw more clothing over her, or at least keep the room warm enough, there will be sudden suppression of the sweat, and this will bring on milk fever and other febrile symptoms which will need Bryonia.
Threatened peritonitis, from such causes, gonorrheal troubles, old rheumatic troubles, pains or aches, if made worse from the slightest motion.
If due to septicemia rather than to suppression of the sweat, very commonly a deeper acting remedy is required. In inflammatory conditions of the breast one of the most striking things is the stony hardness of the breasts, hardness and heaviness.
Bryonia is often suitable for inflammation of the breasts at other times; heaviness and hardness of the breast prior to menstruation.
Respiratory: Then we come to the respiratory tract again, which we have only hinted at, and here we have a tremendous study before us.
Very commonly the Bryonia conditions commence with a cold; it may be at first loss of voice, with rawness in the trachea and great soreness in the chest; dry, hacking cough, as if the chest would burst from coughing.
The Bryonia patient sits up and holds the head, or holds the chest; presses both hands upon the chest when coughing, feels as if the chest would fly to pieces when coughing; pains in the chest on both sides, but mostly the right side.
Bryonia prefers the right side when the condition is pneumonia. We see a patient who had first a cold, and the cold has traveled down the air passages, with hoarseness and rawness in the chest and cough; the cough shakes the whole body, then comes a hard chill.
He is now down in bed, and when the physician sees him be sees the state of inflammation and knows the meaning of it, and listening confirms the diagnosis of pneumonia.
The patient cannot move hand or foot; the pain is mostly in the right lung, and he is compelled to lie on the right side or back and dreads motion. Sometimes the pleura is involved and we have the sharp pains; every respiration causes intense pain, whether it be pleuro-pneumonia or a simple pneumonia.
But we see the Bryonia patient lying upon the side that is affected, upon the painful side, in order to diminish the motion that respiration causes; and every often he will have a hand under it to see if he cannot hold it still.
With Bryonia the expectoration is of a reddish tinge, is rusty, and if you have this symptom and the right side affected, it is all the more strongly Bryonia.
There are a few medicines that look somewhat like Bryonia; take for instance, a case with high fever, intense heat, great excitement, and consider the rapidity with which the trouble has come on, involving the left side and in the pan you see the sputum consists of bright red blood, Aconite will be the remedy.
If the liver is involved, there is fullness in the side, stitching pain over the liver, and the face is yellow, it is not impossible for Bryonia to be indicated, for it has such things, but with pain very severe, continually going from the front to the back through the right shoulder blade, Chelidonium is more likely to cure than Bryonia.
These comparisons may be carried out indefinitely, but the study of Bryonia as to the respiratory apparatus is a wonderful one.
With these colds that end in loss of voice, it has bringing and tickling in the larynx, constant cough. Hoarseness and loss of voice in singers.
Great soreness in the trachea; rawness and tightness in the trachea, even suffocation, like Phosphorus.
The Bryonia breathing is panting and very rapid, little short rapid breaths, due to the fact that deep breathing increases the pain, the Bryonia patient desires to breathe deep, wants deep breathing, needs deep breathing, but it hurts him so.
"Constant disposition to sigh," but cannot because it hurts him so.
Shortness of breath, suffocation, asthma. Asthmatic attacks from becoming overheated. Asthma worse in a warm room, wants cool air to breathe.
"Dry, spasmodic cough, whooping cough, shaking the whole body."
Cough compels him to spring up in bed involuntarily, painful cough with difficult breathing, cough that shakes the whole body. Tough, difficult expectoration.
"Cough evening and night, dry cough." A great deal of the rest of Bryonia, as we go over it is repetition.
If you will only read the text carefully and make application of what has been said, you see the general character and idea of the remedy, you see its image and you will fill it out for yourselves, if you have a full text-book.
Bufo
The little lands along the back of the toad's neck, when squeezed with forceps, ooze a secretion which is soluble in alcohol and has been proved, this is the subject we will now consider.
Bufo satyhienis is the one I use in practice. Bufo is a wonderful medicine, it profoundly affected the mind and especially the intellectual faculties, including confusion of mind and loss of memory until the patient gradually goes towards a state of imbecility.
The greatest use of this medicine will be found in nervous conditions, throbbings, jerking and spasmodic condition of muscles, ulceration of the skin and mucous membranes, and all this in such patients as are tending towards a state of imbecility, a state of confusion or weakness of mind.
The imbecility is more frequent in Bufo than the active states of insanity or mania, yet these appear occasionally through the remedy.
The first symptom in the text reads, "Desire for solitude in order to practice masturbation."
This alone throws a flood of light upon the nature of the remedy; the lack of government, the lack of control over the sexual longing, and the low-mindedness whereby he is willing to abandon himself to the lower things that are in the human race, to perverted practices and vices. It tells a great story.
"Whimpered, then cried, until he fell into a state of coma."
These states, as brought out clinically, are manifested in adult people who act as if they were children. An aspect of child-like simplicity is present and the mind returns to a state of child-like innocence.
An adult takes on the ways of a child, as a state of imbecility. This mental state is especially found under Baryta carb. in adults who have never developed beyond childhood, who have always remained children.
A person reasons like a child, talks like a child, whimpers like a child, cries like a child, wants to be petted like a child; so it is in Baryta carb. We find this state of mind in children who have developed epilepsy, but
we do not prescribe this remedy on account of the epilepsy; the child has not developed properly, and the epilepsy is only one of the manifestations.
The cause is far back, and is really the psoric condition. Thereby the mental state has not developed, the child has not grown into a man or woman in intellectual attainments or wisdom, and remains as a whimpering, screaming child.
This lack of development is found in Bufo and in Baryta carb.; they are related to each other in that the child-like state remains while the body grows.
We see in these medicines the fear and simplicity that belongs to the child; always sickly, deficient, never reaching adult fullness or growth, always a child.
"How much like a child that woman appears,” or "How much like a child that man is."
We say that of some old people, they are so childish. The old routinists have said of those people who are prematurely old or have taken on senility, that they need Baryta carb.
This medicine also stands out in bold type for those prematurely senile; the man at fifty acts like an old broken-down man of eighty; he has lost all he had five or six years ago, and has taken on a child-like
simplicity and innocence, an appearance of imbecility.
Then it is that we think of this medicine. Baryta carb. has hitherto been the leading one, but Bufo is also very important.
"Left his bed after apathy and ran like mad through the house."
There it branches off from the condition of imbecility to that of excitement of mind. Most of the Bufo patients will be passive, placid, not in a state of excitement or mania, but passive in everything. Feeble- minded, simple, child-like.
"Weak memory and idiotic."
"Longs for solitude, yet dreads being alone."
"Angry, bites at surrounding objects."
"Easily laughs or cries."
It has been used in delirium tremens, during the stages of excitement and mental prostration, biting and grasping things.
"Titters," now that is more expressive than to say she laughs, she titters at every little thing that is said. Titters and says foolish things; titters over things that are not laughable; everything said seems to be funny to this simple, child-like woman.
You know a child laughs and is merry, but we do not expect such things in adults except when what is said is particularly ludicrous. These symptoms are sometimes met in epileptics.
"Easily laughs or cries;” easily affected, and extremely sensitive, nervous nature. Again, the most extreme anxiety, night and day, wringing the hands and talking about something awful that is going to happen when there is nothing to happen; some awful event, some terrible thing in the future, it is all darkness and despair, walks the floor and wrings the hands and says over and over the same awful things that are going to take place, when in reality the future is safe and there is nothing to be anxious about.
This occurs in cases of insanity. Such as are approaching imbecility are passive, they have a lack of comprehension of things around; but those that are going into. insanity have an increased imagination of the things that surround them. Where these symptoms have been induced by secret vice.
"Become angry if misunderstood."
This is approaching insanity. It is well known to medical men and to the courts that these conditions of insanity intermingle in the human race with epilepsy, and that an epileptic is not always held responsible for murder, because it is so well known that the epileptic state of the body is not confined merely to the spasms of the muscles, the sudden falling, foaming at the mouth, clonic spasms, biting of the tongue, etc. These alone do not constitute all of epilepsy.
The epileptic suffers from an underlying psoric state, which in one is a state of imbecility and in another a state of epileptic manifestation, and in another a state of insanity. Those who inherit this peculiar constitution, even in one family, exhibit it in different ways; one will be insane, another an imbecile, another will die of cancer and another will be an epileptic.
Bufo, underlies such a constitution; it is an antipsoric, it is a deep-seated, vital remedy; it goes to the very heart and interior of man's physical nature, and from this mental state it may manifest itself in his ultimates, the fingers and toes, eyes, ears, etc., so that even the touch is disordered.
There are patches upon the skin that have loss of sensation and others with increased sensations. Spasms of various muscles, sometimes local spasm and sometimes complete epileptic spasms with bleeding at the mouth, unconsciousness, falling down. Besides such grave state, it has milder states that may be called dizziness or vertigo.
The milder conditions of dizziness have gone on to sudden falling and collapse, a sudden state of unconsciousness with spasms and biting of the tongue. In the proving we find attacks of apathy and partial coma; numbness of the brain. So we see in the text that we have conditions ranging from mere dizziness to a complete and profound epilepsy.
The study of this remedy may reveal to you something of the, nature of epilepsy. From the allopathic treatises on epilepsy you will only get the appearance of the fit, and the fit is treated as epilepsy. They hunt for remedies to subdue and control the fit, thinking when they have done that they have cured the patient.
They feed these patients Bromides in large doses and now and then they branch off into some side issue, but go back to the Bromides and stupefy and make imbeciles of their patients. Prescribing for the fit has never cured the patient,
"Congestive headaches."
Eyes: Again, its action on the circular fibres of the abdominal aorta furnishes a key-note in epilepsy. An awful sensation of anxiety is felt in the abdomen and then there is a sudden loss of consciousness; the aura or warning is first felt in the abdomen. Some writers have described it as in the solar plexus. The awful sensation occurs as an anxiety and then he falls.
"Cannot bear the sight of brilliant objects."
"Amaurosis,” etc.
"Pupils largely dilated and unaffected by light before attack." "More acute vision."
It has spasmodic conditions of the eye, but increased vision and diminished sensation, and lastly a tendency to profound trophic disturbance.
Little blisters form upon the eye. These little blisters also form upon the skin, and the integument is thrown off and there is. no healing. Ulcers will form upon the cornea.
"Eyes become highly injected." Paralytic conditions of the lids and muscles of the eye. There is disturbance of all the senses.
"Music is unbearable."
Ears: One who is in a natural state is expected to enjoy beautiful music, whereas in this remedy music brings about a state of anxiety. The sense of hearing is so violently exaggerated that every little noise is distressing.
"Purulent otorrhoea."
"Swelling of the ears; of the parotids."
"Phlegmonous erysipelas about the face."
"Falling out of the teeth" in the peculiar disease known as Rigg’s disease.
"Stuttering and stammering; gets angry when incoherent speech is not understood."
"Biting the tongue."
"Tongue cracked, bluish black."
"Mouth wide open before an attack," showing that the spasm is coming on; and this condition increases so that when the attack is not on, he drops the jaw and looks stupid as if be bad forgotten everything.
Bufo often corresponds to lesser attacks resembling vertigo. In this state people do not fall, and for a few seconds everything is blank, or sometimes they do things automatically in these moments.
A person, in this mild form of epileptic vertigo, will hardly show anything, but he will sometimes come to a perfect standstill and then go on as if nothing had happened. What occurred during that attack he knows nothing of.
Sometimes be will continue right on doing what he was doing, and nobody will know of the spell. Sometimes when driving he will turn his horses around, and when he comes to himself he will know by this that he Ins had one of his attacks.
Stomach and abdomen: Quite a number of medicines have produced that condition of the mind, a state in which he goes on doing things automatically.
"Vomiting after drinking.”
"Yellow fluid in vomit. "
"Vomiting of bile or blood."
"Spasms end by convulsive movements in abdomen." It says in the text,
"The attack originates in abdomen;" that is, he has a feeling of anxiety in the abdomen previous to the attack.
"Hemorrhoidal tumors." "Urine passes involuntarily."
The urine passes involuntarily in such as arc becoming imbeciles from the epileptic attacks, in approaching softening of the brain, which is really what is taking place, a form of softening, a lowered form of integrity.
Genitals: As you might suppose, there is great disturbance of the sexual organs, this is usually the case in insane people. Sometimes the sexual organs are in a state of excitement and sometimes in a state of impotency, but the patient is low-minded, inclination to carry the band constantly to the genital organs.
"Semen is discharged too quickly without pleasurable sensation."
Spasms or epilepsy comes on during coition. It has also inflammation of glands, especially about the groins, such as are found in syphilis.
In the female sexual organs burning is the most striking feature burning in the ovaries and uterus. It is one of the most troublesome, symptoms you will have to contend with, when a case of dysmenorrhoea has burning in the ovaries and in the pelvis, at the coming on of or during menses.
Burning in the genital organs, in the ovaries, and rending, tearing pains that extend down the thighs. This forms a troublesome kind of dysmenorrhoea, especially when there are cysts and hydatids about the ovaries. Some will tell you that these cannot be cured.
All these conditions are curable!
"Burning beat and stitches in ovaries."
"Distending, burning pains or cramps in uterus."
This remedy has been a great palliative for these awful burning pains that occur in carcinoma of the uterus; stitching, rending, tearing pains in carcinoma of the uterus, when the pains run outwards into the legs, with ulceration of the uterus and cervix; tearing, stinging pains and bloody, offensive leucorrhea.
Bufo is full of offensive discharges; bloody, offensive leucorrhea. You would think you had the odor of gangrene or gangrenous erysipelas in the room from smelling these discharges.
"Enormous blisters upon tumefied uterus, discharging a thin, serous, yellow fluid." This occurs in epileptic states.
"Menstruation suppressed,"
"too early with headache,"
"burning in uterus and vagina."
"Spasms occur just before menses."
That is, girls who are subject to epilepsy have increase of spasm at the time of menses, sometimes before, sometimes during.
"Attacks worse at time of menses.” During menses contractive pain in liver. "Yellow fluid leucorrhoea."
When the girl lies in an unconscious condition during the menstrual period and has several epileptic spasms which she has no realization of until told and then she is too much dazed to understand it she needs Bufo.
Bufo has been a great palliative in cancer of the mammae, for the burning pains and for the blisters that form roundabout; large, yellow blisters; blisters that fill with yellow, serous discharge; it has been especially useful when the milk is mixed with blood.
Larynx and chest: It corresponds to the low form of inflammation of the blood- vessels, like milk leg, when the veins feet like whipcords in the thighs.
" : : : : " Burning, excoriation in larynx.
You see how burning runs all through the remedy; it occurs wherever there are inflammatory conditions or where nerves are sensitive and painful, and the nerve sheath becomes painful and sensitive to touch along its course hence its use in sciatica and other inflammatory conditions of large nerves.
"Violent cough with vomiting."
Cough with gagging and retching. Expectoration is bloody or formed of pure blood. Sensation of coldness in chest.
"Burning like fire in lungs."
Burning extending up into the larynx; gangrene of the lungs.
"Laryngitis, haemoptysis."
Burning in the chest with all these affections, such as have been described. It has the phtisical constitution when the epilepsy has been turned aside by strong drugs. It has the phtisical constitution when discharges
have been suppressed by closing fistulous openings, or by stimulating ointments.
It has those low forms of disease which must develop when outward manifestations have been suppressed. The constitution that belongs to the very nature of the individual will come out in epilepsy, in insanity, in imbecility, in cancer, in some one of the low forms of disease. This medicine corresponds to a low type and constitution.
The nature of the Bufo constitution is such that it is capable of giving out symptoms similar to those produced by low forms of disease.
He is not likely to live to be old, he A likely to break down at forty. She comes to her end by cancer of uterus or breast, or by imbecility. He comes to his end with low forms of disease, malignant manifestations. This medicine, therefore goes into the very life.
Children develop an unusual tendency to low forms of chronic disease; they do not possess a good healthy nature, a good sound brain; but they are feeble, they break out with eruptions, they go into consumption. Persons of twenty-five have a tendency to break down, and when the symptoms look like those of Bufo this medicine will, in a wonderful way, make that constitution all over.
Such cases as these only get well by a violent turmoil and by tremendous aggravations. When we approach these diseases by easy stages the patient does not got so much disorder or excitement, but is not cured so radically. Old diseases would reappear, old gonorrheal would be brought back, and old syphilitic states come up, ulcers attack the mucous membranes, etc.
Such turmoil is likely to occur when you get a deep acting remedy, such as brings all the disease out that was lurking within.
"Attacks ushered in by a jerk in the nape of neck." "Swelling of bone she of Ea."
"Arms became stiffened before an attack." "Numbness of left arm."
"Blister in hand, which recurred annually." "Panaritium."
A great many troubles occur in the extremities, paralytic affections, etc.
A warm room is unbearable; headaches and flushes of the face are made worse in a warm room or when near the stove, better from bathing or in cold air. Complaints better from putting the feet in hot water.
Trembling. Some of the epileptic attacks occur with regular periodicity, others occur irregularly. We have no remedy for epilepsy.
Does that mean we must leave the human race to go on and suffer with epilepsy? We do have plenty of remedies for people who have epilepsy. A large percentage of the cases are curable.
After what has been said concerning the nature of this remedy I am sure you will read the symptoms with great interest.
When you read the symptoms, they will cling around the constitution and nature of such individuals and such states as have been described.
This is one of the remedies that you will need to use for the development of feeble-minded children whether there are spasms or not.
Cactus Grandiflorus
Generalities: Constrictions, contractions and congestions run through Cactus.
Determination of blood to the head, and coldness of the extremities. Or determination of blood to an organ, the chest, or the heart. There is never an equal circulation of blood in the body; it is spasmodic and irregular. Disturbed by contractions of circular fibres everywhere. When this comes in places where it can be felt; and realized by the senses, it is felt as contractions, as if caged in wires, and this gives us the key to Cactus.
Where contractions cannot be felt, where there is no sense of feeling, we know that it goes on as a spasmodic condition of circular fibres; but these contractions that are felt are more upon the surface of the body, and in organs having circular fibers tubes and canals.
They constrict, and this constriction is felt like a spasm. It has a sensation of tightness and constriction about the head, about the chest, about the attachments of the diaphragm, all over the abdomen. Contractions about the heart that are tonic in character, like a tight clutching; constriction.
"Constriction felt about the heart."
Constrictions and congestions: These constrictions are felt about the throat, in the oesophagus, causing a spasm; in the vagina, causing vaginismus and preventing coition.
In the uterus it produces the, most violent cramps. Clutching, and constrictions, as it the uterus were grasped and held tightly, like a spasm. But at these times, when these constrictions take place, there are congestions.
"Rush of blood to the part, with constriction."
"Violent congestion of the uterus with constrictions. Rush of blood to the chest, as if the chest was filled with hot gushes of blood, with constrictions, and constriction of the heart."
These peculiarities run through Cactus more markedly than any other remedy. Many remedies have similar things now and then, but in Cactus it is common, it is the nature of Cactus to constrict, to cause constriction in places where it has never been felt, and never been thought of.
Constrictions of the whole body, as if the body was held in a wire cage. Constrictions of the scalp, of the skin, growing tighter and tighter. Violent congestions that come on suddenly. Congestion of the brain, with hot head, flushed face.
At the beginning of complaints, at the beginning of pneumonia; congestive chill with hot head and cold body (like Arn.) with violent constrictions and tightness, as if the head were pressed, as if the membrane of the brain were too tight, as if the brain were covered with a tight cloth, and were being screwed tighter and tighter.
Uniform tightness of an organ, as if it were being bound tighter and tighter, but in tubes and canals it is a constriction of a particular part. Many times like as if tied with a string. Constriction, like hour-glass contraction, in the uterus.
It has inflammations, congestions, rush of blood to the part, gradually progressing to inflammation, and infiltration. Inflammation of various parts.
It has rheumatism. It is a remedy very useful in gouty constitutions; very useful in acute inflammatory rheumatism; and in this instance the congestion is in the joints that happen to be affected.
And then again the constriction, as if tied with a tape, or as if bandaged. Tightness, tension, pressure, are involved in that thought. It has such a prolonged determination of blood to the heart that the heart finally becomes disturbed in its function, disturbed in its tissues; and it has a profound curative action upon the heart and even cures organic heart diseases, such as are produced from this cause, conditions coming on from congestion, or coming on through congestion in rheumatic constrictions, where the rheumatism has left the joints partially and the heart has become involved, and there is constriction of the heart.
Various efforts have been made by provers, and by patients, to describe the constriction of the heart. It is sometimes described
"as if grasped with an iron hand."
It is only to illustrate the tenacity of the constriction. In these rheumatic troubles when the joints have ceased to be affected and the heart becomes affected with this chronic congestion and enlargement, we have enlargement of the valves so that there are murmurs, the head is hot, and the patient gradually emaciates.
Kidney troubles will come on; the heart grows weaker, and then dropsical conditions set in that is, the course of Cactus.
Towards the last, cardiac affections, along with kidney affections, with emaciation, and then swelling of the hands, and feet. That is the very nature of Cactus, and you will not find any medicine in the whole Materia Medica that reads like it.
There is nothing to compare with it in the intensity of these symptoms. All these things that I have described seem to turn upon these words, congestion, constriction and contraction.
The pains in Cactus are violent, no matter where they occur. They compel the patient to cry out, and the pains are clutching pains, constricting pains; they often feel like tearing pains; but there is always that idea of clutching.
Suppose you should tie a tape round a violently congested organ, and tie it tighter and tighter. It seems to me that is about the kind of suffering the patient has with that constriction of a congested organ.
Pains and spasms: Pains in congested parts; pains in sore parts. Tearing; constricting, cramping, when pains occur in the intestines they are constricting, but when the pains are in the long muscles they are not the constricting pains, for it is not the circular fibres then but the long fibres that contract, and we call them cramps.
Cactus produces some spasmodic conditions in long muscles, but not to any great extent. In Bell. especially, and also in many of those medicines that have this nature of cramping, and constricting and contracting of circular fibres, there is convulsive tendency.
The violent congestion of the brain in Bell. will commonly be attended with cramps in the extremities and convulsions of the muscles all over or in parts. Not so with Cactus. Violent congestion, and he grows stupid under it.
Congestion of the brain, first with very red face, then darker from the venous stasis, and then stupor. He grows sluggish under the cerebral congestion.
The mental state is that of fear and distress, because of the intensity of the suffering. The patient has never felt such suffering, and he does not see what it can all mean. So much suffering, such violent suffering, such sudden suffering, such cramps, such tearing, such constriction.
When this constriction comes in the heart, and about the chest, it makes the patient think he is going to die, and he is at once, struck with fear, and it is depicted upon the face. He fears death, and it seems he is going to die, his pain is so intense.
But with this intense pain he has nothing of the anxiety we find in, Aconite, which has a similar constriction of the chest and constriction of the neck. The violent choking in Aconite makes him fear he is going to choke, to death, and the anxiety is awful.
It is not so intense in Cactus. Screaming with pains is a common thing in Cactus.
"Taciturn, unwilling to speak a word or to answer."
Mind: That often accompanies the Cactus state, which is the opposite of most of the medicines that have such violent pains.
"Sadness, taciturnity, and irresistible inclination to weep. Fear of death that is, he thinks he is going to die from the severity of the pain. "He believes his disease is incurable;"
it seems to him that such suffering must end in death. That violent, irregular action of the heart is followed out through all the blood vessels, because the circulation is so irregular, is so spasmodic. He is not here, and cold there.
Heat in the head, or heat in the chest. The circulation is that of determination to some particular part. With all the cardiac remedies we have violent dreams, great excitement of the brain during sleep, waking up startled and frightened, very commonly with a feeling of failing. Dreams of falling. Dreams full of excitement. These features run through Cactus, especially with the cardiac symptoms.
"Vertigo from congestion; face red, bloated; pulsation in brain. Feels as if he would go mad. Vertigo, worse from physical exertion."
With most of the cardiac remedies, or remedies where the circulation and heart are much involved, we have marked vertigo.
"Vertigo; worse from physical exertion, turning in bed, stooping, rising from a recumbent position, and deep inspiration."
Many of the complaints of Cactus are disturbed by irregularities of breathing. Here we see vertigo coming on from deep breathing. If he holds his breath, it seems as if his heart would fly to pieces, it would go so fast. Increased pulsation all over the body when holding the breath.
Headaches: The headaches are constricting, pressing. They are all violent, with intense heat of the head, for they are congestive.
A pressing in the top of the head as if the top of the head would be forced in; but this is ameliorated by pressing hard upon the pain.
"Heavy pain like a weight on vertex, better by pressure."
Oftentimes the patient may be wrong in the idea of pressure that is felt in the head. They often describe it in the most marked congestions as if the head would be crushed in, when the congestion in the brain can be seen to be most violent, causing pressure from within out, and we would think they would be better from some sort of support externally, and yet they feel great soreness and feel as if the head is being crushed in.
Others with headaches feel as if the head is being pressed out.
"Heavy pain like a weight on vertex; better by pressure, but worse from sounds, hearing, talking, or strong light."
This runs through the headaches. Greatly aggravated from hearing voices. The sound goes through the head. The brain seems to be sensitive, as if the sound were a material substance hurled at the brain. Right- sided headaches. Pulsating headaches. Heavy, pulsating pain in the head. Tensive pain in the head, tensive pain in the vertex.
A tightness across the vertex, as if the scalp was being drawn tighter and tighter upon the skull.
There can be no doubt about there being a marked cerebral congestion with all these symptoms. The eyes show it; the face shows it; the heat of the head shows it. It has been recommended for threatened apoplexy, when the congestion is so violent, and the face is flushed and purple, or very red, and the pulsation is felt in the brain and all over.
This remedy has the violent congestion of the head found in Bell., but with Bell. we have the intense heat of the body, fever heat which is not found in Cactus. In Cactus it is only a moderate fever. The heat is in the upper part of the body, in the head and neck.
Fullness of the neck; bloating of the neck. Feels as if the head would expand from the pressure of blood in the head, but without any great rise of temperature.
It has fever, but it has these without fever. But with Bell. when you have these pulsations the patient is intensely hot, and he burns all over. There is some burning in Cactus, but not to be compared with Bell. Heat in the head from mental exertion is a strong symptom of Cactus. This symptom is found in persons who are trying to break off from coffee and Cactus is often the remedy.
The patient has choking about the neck, as from a tight collar. Constriction; tension of the skin and muscles everywhere. Choking about the neck with constriction of the heart. Choking about the neck in hysteria;
globus hystericus; a lump or ball coming up into the throat, and she constantly swallows and choked and she goes into cramps with great numbness of the left arm.
Cramping especially of the left arm. Complete numbness of the left arm along with cardiac conditions in the history of rheumatism and in hysteria. The history of rheumatism goes well to fill up the Cactus case. The face is flushed bright red, becoming blue. With weakness of the heart it is blue, blue lips.
We need Cactus for a patient that has constriction about the neck, with congested head, blue face, and lips mottled, numbness of the left band, constriction of the heart. The left hand mysteriously weak, or is numb, tingling and crawling, like a formication.
Congestion and hemorrhages: Another thing running all through the remedy is its hemorrhages. That is not surprising. Any medicine that has such cardiac conditions and such vascular conditions will at times have more or less relaxation of blood vessels, and it would be quite in the nature of it to bleed. It has hemorrhages of two kinds. Hemorrhage from vascular relaxation accompanying cardiac and vascular conditions, and hemorrhage from violent congestion of a part.
The rush of blood to the head is of such violence in the moderately plethoric patient that he bleeds from the nose, and hawks blood from the throat. Congestion of the chest so violent that he expectorates blood from the chest.
Bleeding from congestion, rather than from tuberculosis. Congestion of the uterus with bleeding. Congestion of the bladder and kidneys, with blood in the urine, with discharges of blood from violent congestion. In old cardiac conditions, where relaxation is present in most marked degree, haemorrhage from relaxation.
Strong pulsations felt in strange places, in the stomach, and in the bowels; sometimes in the extremities, the feet and hands, as well as in the head. Throbbing all over.
Around the attachment of the diaphragm feeling as if a cord was tied tighter and tighter; round the lower part of the chest. This is a strange symptom; it clutches him so tightly around the waist line that it takes his breath away, and he struggles for breath, and wants to do something. It clutches him tighter and tighter. Cactus produces congestion of the bowels; inflammation of the uterus. Gastric inflammation and with, it the clutching.
It is a remedy for the cure of hemorrhoids; the relaxation of the great portal system, and the lower veins in the rectum, the hemorrhoidal veins. The veins are in such a state of relaxation that tumors will form, and bleed copiously. Bleeding hemorrhoids. Constriction of the anus. it has a very troublesome constipation; constipation in connection with hemorrhoids.
Bladder: It has a paralytic weakness of the bladder. It has retention of urine. Such a constriction of the neck of the bladder that the urine cannot be passed for a long time, and there is retention. In the kidneys such a congestion as favors suppression of the urine.
Bloody urine; blood in clots. It is a remedy that favors the formation of clots speedily. The blood that flows, clots so rapidly and so densely that it blocks up the way. Bleeding into the bladder blocks up the way. Bleeding into the vagina causes a clot difficult to expel, and pressing upon the urethra of the female that it is impossible for her to pass urine.
It is like an immense tampon. And hence it reads,
"urination prevented by clots,” clots in the vagina, as well as clots in the bladder.
Female: Inflammation of the ovaries; inflammation of the uterus. It is a medicine that you will need to know when a young, plethoric, vigorous woman comes down violently with congestion of the uterus at the menstrual period, and she screams because of the violent clutching and cramping of the uterus.
Before the flow starts, or just at the beginning, there is violent spasm. The circular fibres clutch; and she describes it accurately as if a tape were tied around that sore and congested uterus.
The uterus fills with blood clots, and the spasm to expel that blood is like a labor-pain, and she screams again, and it is some time before the flow becomes free enough to give relief.
If this condition is met with in rheumatic diathesis, where there is more or less rheumatism of the joints, clutching pains and constriction in other places, we have a remedy in Cactus.
The excitement and the sharp scream, can be heard by the neighbors.
Suffocative attacks with these pains, because the heart suffers, and constriction of the heart will commonly go along with the constriction of the uterus. In cardiac conditions it seems as if he will die for want of breath.
Constrictions of the chest. Oppression as if a great load was on his chest, crushing the life out of him, so great is the constriction, and the congestion. A sudden congestion, and it comes on and ends without inflammation in many instances.
A violent rush of blood to the chest, with awful dyspnoea and constriction of the heart and it passes away without inflammation. At other times Cactus has conditions like pneumonia, inflammation of the lungs, and congestion ending in inflammation, with the usual expectoration, bloody or blood streaked.
Cactus is also a remedy for hypostatic congestion of the lungs. He cannot lie down, must sit up in bed, and there is a dullness of the lower part of each lung, gradually growing higher and higher from an effusion of serum into the lower portion of the lungs.
This hypostatic congestion is due to a cardiac weakness. Cactus will often relieve this a few times when it occurs in old broken down cases towards the end of Bright's disease, and at the end of dropsical conditions and heart troubles.
It will postpone death.
"Could only breathe with shoulders elevated and lying on back." Lies leaning back or sitting quite upright.
"Periodical attacks of suffocation, with fainting; cold sweat."
"Feeling as if heart was compressed or squeezed by a band. Cardiac rheumatism, Heart seemed to be held by an iron band for many hours. Pain in the cardiac region. Great pressure at heart, going round under left axilla to back."
Often this pain shoots down the left hand, is attended with numbness, and sometimes with swelling. Numbness, tingling, swelling.
"Dull pain in the heart. Heavy pain in, the heart, aggravated from pressure. Contractive pain in the region of the heart going down to left abdomen. At times felt as if, some one was grasping the heart firmly. Paroxysms of pain in the heart," that is this kind of constriction comes in periods of violent paroxysms. "
" Acute inflammation of the heart. Chronic inflammation of the heart. Palpitation of the heart, continued day and night when walking, and, at night when lying on the left side."
Another thing running through the remedy is that chest com plaints often come on or are exaggerated at if o'clock. Eleven o'clock in the morning, or eleven at night.
Its intermittent fever will bring on a chill with violent congestion to the head at ii o'clock. Regular paroxysms at 1 A.M. and 1 P.M., or sometimes at 1 A.M. and sometimes at if P.M.
A daily chill at 1 A.M. It has cured intermittent fever of the congestive type, when the congestions are here and there, but particularly of head, with constrictions, congestions and contractions.
Cadmium Sulphuricum
Generalities: Cadmium sulph. has been only partially proved, so that only a limited amount of information can be given concerning it.
A medicine may be said to be thoroughly proved when it has left its impress upon all elements of man; when it has affected his memory and his intellect, when it has affected his organs and all their functions, i. e., when healthy man has taken a medicine until all these things are affected and the results are known as the effects of that medicine.
Every medicine affects in some way all these elements of man, and no medicine is well proved until it is known how all these elements are affected.
Mind: There is a dread of work; aversion to doing everything, mental and physical. Anxiety has been brought out more by cures than by the pathogenesis, so that it well enough known to be classed along with Arsenicum for its anxiety; it may well be classed with Arsenicum for its prostration also; it has great weakness; it might also be classed with Arsenicum, because of the organs that are affected, especially because of its action upon the stomach, which is somewhat like Arsenicum, great exhaustion, irritable stomach and vomiting.
It has such vomiting as is found in the lowest forms of fever, such irritable stomach as is found in yellow fever, with black vomiting, and just at this point is the place where the likeness to Arsenicum comes out in the low forms of the fever.
But unlike Arsenicum, running all through the remedy, he wants to be perfectly quiet; part of it is a state of indolence, part of it is an aversion to motion. He is worse from motion, which makes it like Bryonia. So we will see running all through the remedy the exhaustion of Arsenicum and aversion to motion, like Bryonia.
Running through it we find it is spasmodic and nervous; it affects the muscles like Zinc. It is found in its crude state associated with Zinc.
Hering made several observations whereby he tried to prove that substances found together had a relationship and illustrated it by Tellurium which occurs as the telluride of gold. It may be a fact that substances so associated are in some respects similar, but this is only a side thought, as each substance must be studied on its merits,
There must be no guesswork in the study of provings. Every remedy must be used for its own symptoms, and for these there is no substitute. If a remedy does not work, the homeopath can only examine the case anew and seek new symptoms and another remedy.
Head: Vertigo in the room; the bed spins round. The head symptoms, anxiety and vertigo are such as occur in low types of gastro-intestinal irritation, as in continued fevers, deep-seated, slow and sluggish; in yellow fever, with prostration, vomiting of blood, black vomit. Lancinating in the head, pulsating in the temples.
It is not so often called for in ordinary headaches, but in headaches occurring in the low forms of fever, with great rush of blood to the head. Cutting like knives as occurs in yellow fever.
Eyes: The eye symptoms are numerous. Inflammation of a local character; conjunctivitis with discharge, long continued, a chronic conjunctivitis.
Old "sore eyes," rousing up with every cold and change of weather. Thickening of the conjunctiva. Scrofulous sore eyes. Ulcer spots; old scars which break and heal up.
It does wonderful work in curing old eye troubles; opacities with slow inflammation. Pressure above the eyes. Paralysis of the lids; ptosis. It commonly affects one side of the face and one eye. It has paralytic conditions like Causticum; paralysis of one part or of one edge of the body. After an apoplectic attack when the patient recovers, but weakness of one arm and leg remains, it competes with Phos.
Changes in sensation here and there. Formication of the skin and deeper tissues.
"Asleep" sensation, or like ants crawling in the extremities, deep in the muscles and the skin. Hyperesthesia or anesthesia. Numbness of parts; the nose, one hand; numbness in spots. In this it is similar to Caust. Paralyzed parts are sometimes painful. Crawling in paralyzed parts.
Nose: Old nasal catarrh which has progressed till the nasal bones are being destroyed by caries. Ulceration. Pains in the bones. Sneezing; coryza, boils, abscesses.
Mouth and taste: Disturbances of the taste. It is suitable to low forms of continued fever; it has sordes, dark tongue, bleeding tongue and dry mouth, as in typhus, typhoid and yellow fever. Sluggish tongue; difficulty in moving it. Difficult swallowing. The muscles of the throat are affected causing dysphagia. Constriction of the oesophagus. Violent thirst. Every time he takes cold water, which he craves, goose-flesh comes on, a creeping or horripilation like Capsicum.
Stomach: The stomach gives us the strongest and most important symptoms. The stomach quits business; no digestion. Everything sours; fluids and the simplest things taken are changed and come up sour, mixed with blood or bile; rancid eructations; with great exhaustion.
The nausea is distressing. Nauseated all the way down to the abdomen like Ipec., Ant. t., and Asarum, extensive nausea. Cold sweat. Vomiting of yellow-green mucus.
Touching the lips brings on nausea. Looking over the symptoms narrated here an experienced practitioner would think of gastritis-vomiting of the simplest things. Irritation of the stomach after tedious sickness, like cerebro-spinal-meningitis, typhoid, yellow fever.
The stomach gives out; there is no digestion, and everything is vomited. He is convalescing, but his stomach is irritable. He wants to keep still. The Arsenic prostration and irritable stomach occur at the beginning of the fever, with heat and restlessness.
This medicine comes in after the fever, and, with his anxiety he wants to keep still. Arsenic has anxiety and wants to move from bed to bed, and from chair to chair, and he fears death.
In this medicine he seems to say: "Don't speak to me; don't bother me; let me die in peace."
He wants to be perfectly quiet, and the state occurs at the close of a febrile disease. Many of these patients die because they cannot eat, but this remedy will save them. When you have a case of cancer, with burning, prostration, and vomiting, Cadmium sulph. will relieve these symptoms for weeks, I have seen them where the pains have been relieved by anodynes until nothing would stay on the stomach, and this medicine would relieve. It is a great remedy in the gastric irritation of carcinoma, a great palliative; coffee ground vomiting,
Burning and cutting pains in the stomach. Gastric symptoms, such as occur in pregnancy, in old drunkards. Burning in the stomach extending up into the oesophagus; fluids burn all the way up into the mouth and throat; sour, acid fluids. Cold sensation in the stomach. Cholera infantum with irritation of the stomach.
Pain in the abdomen with vomiting. Lancinating in the abdomen from these pains we see it is a medicine which profoundly affects the liver, spleen, stomach and other abdominal viscera. Gangrene threatens. The main remedy in the hands of good prescribers.
Relapses in fever, with vomiting, diarrhoea, and great prostration. At times a case of yellow fever gets along fairly well, but a draft causes a slight cold and on come sudden prostration, black vomit, death. In that state it competes with Carbo veg., which used to be the main remedy in the hands of good prescribers.
Caladium
Caladium is a wonderful remedy; perhaps some of you have read It endeavoring to understand it; it is a difficult medicine to understand, because it is quite evident from the provings that the prover did not understand how to describe and report symptoms; did not know how to tell his sensations because they were so strange; he could not relate his mental state.
Mind: An individual puts his mind to bear upon something which seems to have taken place during the day, but he is not quite sure whether it took place or not; he thinks the matter over, and yet he cannot be really sure whether it took place or not, until he actually goes and puts his hands upon the object thought
about; proves to himself by actual contact and observation that his vague impression was so, that it was true, then he goes away and again he is undecided as to whether it was so or not.
This relates to things that actually happened. "Very forgetful, he cannot remember," etc.
This led to the use of Caladium for a good many different kinds of mental affections, loss of memory where there is that vague state of mind.
It might be bordering upon imbecility, it might be the borderland of insanity. All day long he finds himself looking into the things that should have been done; they have simply escaped his mind; he has forgotten them. So the mind is worn through in places.
A state of absent-mindedness. It may come on in an acute state, with unconsciousness. There is a good deal of congestion of the brain, more or less excitement, but more important is prostration of the mind, weakness of the mind; feeble-minded; inability to perform intellectual work, it is impossible.
He cannot think; the more thought he puts upon a thing the more fatigue he has and the further away that thing seems to be; the more he attempts it the less concentrated is the mind upon a subject. It is not strange, then, that the provers themselves were unable to put these ideas into speech so as to give us an intelligent idea of proving. It is only by reading between the lines, using the remedy and studying it that we can straighten out this tangled skein.
"Very thoughtful, absentminded.”
There is in acute states delirium, excitement of mind, unconsciousness, stupefaction. As the febrile state is continued, we have this mental state. This remedy is useful in fevers that are continued.
One of the most important things to decide when we are going into the mental state of a remedy is whether we shall use this remedy in hysteria, in the delirium of the various phases of fever, or in insanity, and to ascertain this we turn to that part of the proving which gives us the pace of the remedy.
If we want to understand the delirium of Belladonna and Bryonia to see which one would be suitable in a certain case, we turn to the febrile action of the remedy and see what the nature of that is; the pace tells us largely what kind of delirium, if we do not know from the delirium itself.
So we will see that in Belladonna there is no continued fever, and as a remedy must, in its very nature, be adapted to the very nature of the disease, it would be useless to follow the many injunctions that are written in our books telling us to give Belladonna in the acute form of delirium: in typhoid fever; but Bryonia has just that condition; hence we will see that Bryonia is useful in such cases which present symptoms similar to it, because the pace of the disease is similar to the pace of Bryonia, which has continued fever.
Belladonna has intermittent and remittent fever, particularly remittent, and hence the acute delirium of Belladonna is similar to the acute delirium of remittent fever. Now to bring this point to bear; this remedy's fever is a continued fever it has not great amount of fever in it, but it is a continued fever we shall see that there is coma and stupor from fever;
"delirium, unintelligible murmuring; " mental prostration.
This remedy is suitable in low, murmuring, exhaustive cases of typhoid fever, cases that are running a very sluggish course; not a very active delirium; but muttering; a low form of semi consciousness, very often coma or stupefaction like Phos. ac., a dazed mind.
Forgetfulness in persons who are mentally and physically prostrated from sexual excesses or from tobacco poisoning. It is indicated in old debauches who are unable to perform the marital act. He has the most tantalizing craving for the opposite sex with no ability to perform coitus. Lascivious ideas.
Such men stand on the street corner and feast upon the forms of passing girls, and their semen dribbles away; a state also found in Picric acid and Selenium.
You can only cure these patients if they desire to reform, and if you can inspire them to live a better life. Without this you cannot save them, and those who take delight in such things are not worth saving, and medicine will not take hold of them. To cure, the patient must use his will to help the remedy.
Extremely nervous; afraid of his own shadow; awake all night with lascivious thoughts, apprehensions, especially before going to sleep; afraid of the future. Fear of catching diseases when they are not around.
This alternates with an opposite condition. At times he is wholly incapable of appreciating danger. He will go into any sort of danger without thought. Foolish boldness. We may sum up the mental symptoms by saying he is extremely excitable.
Vertigo: Vertigo on closing the eyes. He cannot stand or walk with the eyes shut, but it is not otherwise sufficiently related to locomotor ataxia to be of use in that disease.
Rocking, dizzy sensation after lying down and closing the eyes, as it in a rocking chair. Vertigo and nausea in the morning with stitch in pit of stomach. He opens his eyes and asks:
"Where am I? What do you want around me?"
The text is long with many vague symptoms. The mental symptoms are the most important.
Mind: The whole nervous system is ina state of excitement. He is full of fear; startled by the slamming of a door, or the rattling of a newspaper. Cannot sleep if there is the least noise. Things are done in great haste. Nervous excitement.
The patient in general is aggravated by warmth and the warm room, and ameliorated by cool open air. Yet he wants warm drinks in the stomach. Longs for beer without a decided thirst. Eats without hunger and drinks without thirst. Nervous fantastic things run through the remedy showing its relation to neurasthenic and hysterical patients. Eructations.
Skin: There is a sensitiveness of the skin. Crawling; creeping. He has the spider-web sensation. Sensation of a fly crawling on the face. The perspiration is sweetish, and if he is in a room with others, while perspiring, the flies will all light on him.
Sweetish odor to the perspiration. which attracts the flies.
Tobacco heart. The nervous symptoms of tobacco are similar to those of Caladium, and Caladium is useful in all sorts of nervous conditions, the effect of tobacco and cigarette smoking. It has a number of time
turned the patient entirely away from his cigar, and removes the overwhelming craving that prevents smokers breaking off their habit.
Headaches and mental states in smokers.
Itching is violent, especially about the genitals. It is useful in extremely nervous women who suffer from pruritus vulvae, keeping them awake at night, attended with abnormal excitement.
Stools soft, yellow, pasty, mushy, as in typhoid. Stitches as from knives in the rectum. There are many urinary symptoms. Urine offensive, putrid, scanty.
Pulsating in the stomach after walking; empty feeling, fluttering in the stomach.
Genitals: Violent sexual desire with relaxed penis. Impotency. Erections when half asleep in the morning, ceasing when fully awake.
When the desire is most marked he has no ability. Automatic erections without desire, strong and painful. During an embrace no emission. It has urethral discharge and is useful in gonorrhea.
In vigorous persons after the gonorrhoeal discharge has been improperly suppressed, sometimes impotency is the result of the suppression. Caladium has cured as frequently as Thuja. Itching eruption on the scrotum.
The most striking symptom of the female sexual organs is the pruritus; she is compelled to scratch, and the torment reduces her in body and mind.
Sleep: There are some strange sleep symptoms. Kept awake by crawling. Sleeplessness from pruritus, especially in the genitals.
Groans and moans anxiously in sleep so that he wakens the neighbors. Restless sleep; anxious, vivid dreams which he remembers better than the things of the day. Falls asleep and continues to dream of the same subject where he left off.
Calcarea Arsenicosa
As this remedy is a chemical union of two well proved deep acting remedies it would most likely appear at once to the mind as a long acting remedy, well suited to many chronic diseases.
In fact, it is deep acting enough to cure some of our most stubborn cases of epilepsy. It has made its record in this class of cases.
Great mental and physical weakness. Tremulous and paralytic weakness. Sense of lightness of the body as if floating in the air. Fainting spells. Epileptic convulsions where the aura is felt in the region of the heart. Marked lassitude. Pain and sinking in the region of the heart followed by spasms. Weakness, or vertigo, or momentary blindness.
Convulsions with valvular disease of the heart. Evening and night aggravations are common. The patient is sensitive to cold-a lack of vital heat. Aversion to the open air.
General physical anxiety. Many symptoms from ascending stairs. It has many burning pains like Arsenicum.. It has cured many cases of albuminuria in the early stages.
It is a useful remedy in chlorosis. Dropsy is a strong feature, as it is in Arsenicum and Calcarea. Complaints
are worse from slight exertion; faintness, palpitation, dyspnea and weakness come on. The left side of the body is most affected.
Mind: The following mental symptoms are often a guide to its use. Anger and complaints from anger and vexation.
Anxiety in evening, at night, in bed, and during a chill, and on waking. Apprehensiveness; about the future, about his salvation, at night. Inclined to criticize.
Desire for company. Confusion of mind on waking. Inability to concentrate the mind. Delusions. Sees dead people, phantoms, images. Illusions of fancy.

Timidity. Weeping, at night.
Head: There is violent rush blood to the head with vertigo and general spasm. It has caused and cured many chronic headaches.
A very peculiar feature of the pain in the head is that it moves from the side lain on and goes to the side not lain on, and continues to change about by changing position.
Not all of its headaches do this way. It has many peculiar little symptoms. Pain in the head ameliorated during mental exertion, but much worse afterwards. Oedema of face, lids, temples and ears.
Eczema of face and scalp. Coldness of head. Pale, sickly, bloated face. Fluent coryza. Sneezing.

Much soreness in region of kidneys. Scanty, burning urine, contains albumin and casts.
Pain in the spermatic cords, after exertion, and after drinking wine.
Excoriating, yellow leucorrhoea. Offensive, bloody leucorrhoea. For offensive leucorrhea, it compares with Kali ars. and Kali phos, it is useful in cancer of the uterus when there is burning and acrid offensive bloody flow.
It restores the menstrual flow, when the symptoms agree. Copious menstrual flow, or scanty flow, too frequent and protracted.
Pain at the approach of the menses. Metrorrhagia. Burning pain in uterus and vagina.

The sleep is disturbed by violent dreams. Palpitation and suffocation. Latter part of night wakeful, and much sweat.
If this wonderful remedy is studied with the mind on Arsenicum and Calcarea, a broader knowledge will be gained. It needs further proving in potencies.
Calcarea Carbonica
If you were about to produce a Calcarea subject to order you could do so by feeding him lime or lime water until the digestive organs were so debilitated that they could no longer digest lime; and then the tissues would be increasingly deprived of what they need, and give us the lime subject, the "bone salt inanition" case, for that is really what it is. Infants that are fed lime water in the milk will in a little while be lime subjects.
They will soon get in such a state that they cannot take the lime from their natural food, and the result will be a Calcarea subject such as we are about to describe.
But the natural cases are those that have a natural sickness, are born so, born with an inability to digest the lime that is in their natural food, and they grow fat and flabby, and produce deficient bones.
There is a greater proportion of cartilaginous material in the bones than lime, and the bones bend, and take on diseases and destructive troubles. Deficient teeth, or no teeth at all. The bones simply stop growing, and the patient goes into marasmus.
What a foolish notion it is to feed that infant lime water because he cannot digest lime! Is it not just as reasonable as anything else in allopathy? And yet our homeopaths use allopathic medicines. They use the lowest potencies they can get and it would seem strange if those substances cured any better in the hands of the homeopath than in the hands of the allopath.
Nor, it is astonishing that one single dose of the potency suitable to meet the state of disorder will make that infant commence to digest its food, and appropriate from its food the lime substance that it needs in its bones, and wherever else it needs it.
All at once the teeth begin to grow; the bones begin to grow, and the legs get stiff enough for him to begin to walk, and they will hold up. It is astonishing what changes will take place under the various medicines that are suitable for the disturbances of the hair, and the bones and nails.
The remedy must be sufficiently potentized to correspond with the wrong. It certainly must not be crude because the child is already stunted by the crude material. You will see within a month or six weeks after giving a solitary dose of the sufficiently potentized remedy the nails that were corrugated and uneven and spotted and irregular will form a margin and will grow out smooth.
You will see the ugly little crowns upon the teeth, distorted, and black things as they come up out of the gums; but when they have been under the suitable homeopathic remedy you will see them form a margin line, and from there on the teeth look healthy, and from there on the little body of the tooth is smooth and round; just as if that child bad had an impulse to grow better teeth.
That same thing probably takes place where the bones exist. The periosteum takes on healthy work.
This is the Calcarea state when the patient needs lime and he cannot get it because he has been cloyed; or, because he has an indigestion, he is unable to assimilate the lime that is in his food, and it goes through him and does not affect him.
So it is with much of the sickness we have, an inability to extract from the food and assimilate such things as the body needs. Would not anyone be a simpleton to suppose that he had been the cause of the building of a tooth?
You do not build mole hills out of our high potencies; they simply establish a state of order, so that digestion and assimilation go on, order is established and the tissues are improved.
Health comes, beauty, a growth of hair, better skin, better nails.
The Calcarea constitution is what we want to know. We do not need to know that the individual has been poisoned by lime; it is not worth much to know it, because that is not the index to the remedy. If indigestion of lime has been brought about by lime, it may need one of ten other remedies to overcome that indigestion for lime.
It is not always Calcarea that covers the symptoms. The medicine that covers the symptoms is the one that will change the economy from an abnormal to a normal state, and digestion will become orderly, and we will have growth and prosperity in the economy.
Aspect: The Calcarea case is to be known by the symptoms, and not by the fact that the patient has been poisoned by lime; the chances are that those we have to treat have never had any lime. Many of them have never been poisoned by lime but have been unable to assimilate lime from birth.
Calcarea is full of congestions, determination of blood to the head cold feet; hot head; congestion of the chest. Calcarea corresponds in a very high degree to the chlorotic and anaemic, pale and waxy, and in spite of this plump. It has both fat, flabby and pale patients and it has emaciated states, too.
Muscles emaciate. Emaciated about the neck; emaciated about the neck and from there downwards. Anemic conditions; pale, waxy, sickly; pale lips; pale ears; pale fingers; pale and yellowish.
Chlorosis is a word especially relating to the anemia of girls. A large number of remedies is indicated in those conditions, but Calcarea produces the kind of anemia known as chlorosis. It produces most pernicious anemia.
Great relaxation in the tissues everywhere; relaxation of muscles; relaxation of veins; relaxation of the walls of blood-vessels to such a great extent, especially in the lower limbs and anus, that there are marked hemorrhoidal manifestations or marked varicose veins in the legs. Distended veins, burning in these varicose veins. Burning and smarting. Bleeding and oozing. Inflammation and painful swelling of joints.
Glands: Another marked feature running through the remedy is its tendency to attack glands, the glands of the neck, all of the glands of the body, especially the lymphatic glands.
The lymphatic glands in the abdomen become hard, inflamed and sore, like great nodules, like hickory nuts; tubercular. Calcarea is useful in tubercular formations.
Calcareous degenerations, calcareous glands, induration of glands. It is useful in indurations in ulcers, and the base of ulcers, and round about ulcers, hence its wonderful use in palliating and restraining the growth of malignant ulcers, as malignant ulcers always have an indurated base.
Old cancerous ulcers are greatly restrained in their growth, that is, the constitutional state is much improved, the patient himself has more endurance and the ulcers will take on healing. In cancerous affections that would kill in sixteen months the patient will live five years with Calcarea, if Calcarea is indicated.
That is something, and in any times that is all that can be expected in a cancerous growth.
In glandular affections where the glands round about are infiltrated and hard, where there is much burning and stinging pain, where the growth has invaded and appropriated the surrounding tissues so that there are adhesions, matters are serious.
There is malignancy in almost all these cases. They differ entirely from glands that are loose from the skin, glands that roll under the skin, and have no fibrous attachment. Cancerous affections burn and sting. Calcarea cures many tumors, fatty, cystic, if the symptoms agree, so strongly is it related to this building tip process in glands. It builds up glands and bone.
Another thing running through the remedy is a pyoemic state, in which there are abscesses in deep muscles. Abscesses deep in the neck, deep in the thigh, in the abdomen.
You will be astonished to learn that Calcarea will take care of the abscess (when the symptoms agree), and it will not break. I have many times seen an abscess disappear when fluctuation was most positive. I have seen those abscesses disappear when pus was shown to he present by the needle; I have not only seen the abscesses go away, but also the pyoemic state which was prior to it. We have but a few medicines that will do that.
There is something singular about this. Why does Calcarea favor the resorption of that fluid and encourage the part to become calcareous?
It is more than I am able to explain, but it does it when the symptoms agree. But Sulph. and Sil., when their symptoms agree hasten suppuration. But Calcarea has that peculiar action of concentrating and contracting.
One may be indicated in one case, the other may be indicated in the other. There are times when Sil. is indicated and the abscess is in such a dangerous place. Then if Sil. is given the result that naturally belongs to the spreading of that abscess is dangerous; in such an instance the surgeon must be called to drain the abscess in a safe manner, even when we know that if that abscess were located in a safe place, it would be far better for that patient to have the remedy he needs.
Sometimes the periosteum is injured by a hammer striking it through muscles, injuring or contusing the periosteum. Inflammation will set in, pus will form rapidly, and if Calcarea is indicated by the constitution of the patient the surgeon's knife is entirely useless, and a most detrimental thing.
But in thinking from the old standpoint, the physician who knows nothing about Homoeopathy, and the wonders of our homeopathic remedies, would hold up his hands in horror.
"Why, if you produce a resorption of that pus into the system you will have blood poisoning and death."
But under Calcarea this resorption does take place in some manner, and the patient improves every moment, he stops his sweating, his rigor has disappeared, he becomes perfectly comfortable, his appetite improves, he is stronger by the time it is over, and remains well.
Judging from the old standpoint, we cannot conclude anything about the problems that will come up under Homoeopathy. We can only judge from our standpoint, and from what we know.
And if you hear that somebody has tried this and tried that without success, remember that somebody has only demonstrated his own failure. Homoeopathy is capable of demonstrating itself in all intelligent hands; wherever the physician has intelligence and makes use of the law and applies the remedy in accordance with the symptoms he will see the case turn out as described.
Polypi: Another grand feature running through this remedy is its ability to grow polypi. Those who need Calcarea will grow polypi in the nose and ears, in the vagina, in the bladder, and here and there. Cystic growths also and strange little papillomata.
Exostoses: Another strange thing that it does is to cause exostoses. This state of disorder comes from the irregularity in the distribution of the lime. You would think that nature would try to distribute it around evenly where it can do the most good.
But when this bone salt inanition has commenced the lime may be piled up in one place, and almost absent in another. One bone will be cartilaginous and another will have bony growths on it. Softening of the bone.
Defective formation of bone. A keynote has grown out of this, viz: "Late learning to walk," because the legs are so weak.
It is not late learning to walk, but it is late walking.
It knows how to walk, but it can't walk. Natrum mur. has brain trouble, in which the child is late learning to do things.
"Tardy development of bone tissues. Curvatures."
Muscles flabby, joint affections, like hip-joint disease. It is full of rheumatism. Rheumatic and gouty conditions of the joints.
The Calcarea patient is a chilly patient. Sensitive to the cold air. Sensitive to the raw winds. Sensitive to the coming of a storm; sensitive to the coming of cold weather, and when the weather changes from warm to cold it seems impossible for him to keep warm; he wants the body kept warm.
Head: The head is sometimes congested; and it is hot to the touch; but it often feels cold to him. His scalp feels as if it were cold. But the body is nearly always cold to the touch and he feels cold, and he wants plenty of clothing.
The feet are cold. He sweats in various places, sweats in spots. Sweats upon the forehead, or upon the face, or upon the back of the neck, or the front of the chest, or his feet.
Sensitiveness to cold and weakness run through the remedy. Weakness in the legs. Inability to endure. Worse from every kind of exertion. Out of breath. Fat, flabby anemic subjects, sometimes they look plump, often flushed in the face, but they have no endurance, and if such a patient undertakes a little exertion he is down sick with a fever, or a headache.
Calcarea is full of complaints brought on from lifting, from exertion, from walking, from walking enough to get into a sweat; and these come very suddenly, because he cannot stop that perspiration by keeping still without getting sick.
If he gets into a sweat, and stops long enough to be comfortable, the perspiration will stop so suddenly that he will have a chill, or he will have a headache. Weak, tired, anxious.
Difficulties of breathing. Weak heart. Weak all over. No ability of the muscles to sustain prolonged effort, and it is the same way with the mind. No ability of the mind to sustain prolonged mental effort. Calcarea is a tired patient.
He is suffering from want of lime. He has been unable to digest lime, and he goes into a state with enlarged glands, emaciation of the neck and of the limbs, while the fat and the glands of the belly increase. Especially is this noticed in children. A big bellied child, with emaciated limbs and emaciated neck.
Enlarged glands. Pale, and flabby, and sickly. Those that take on flesh without any increase of strength. They take on flesh and grow flabby. Remain feeble. Those that get up from sickness take on flabby flesh, and in a little while they become dropsical.
The Calcarea patient can't go upstairs; he is so tired in his legs, and so tired in the chest; he pants and suffocates from going upstairs. He has every evidence of muscular weakness and flabbiness. Nutrition is impaired everywhere.
This is the kind of patient that used to be called scrofulous; now we call the condition psora; and Calcarea is one of our deepest anti-psorics. It is a medicine that goes deep into the life, and takes a deep hold of every part of the economy.
Mind: Now we will take up the mental symptoms. All the mind symptoms represent Calcarea as in a state of great weakness; in ability to prolong mental operation.
Becomes very tired from mental work. Full of anxiety. He is tired mentally, and tired physically, from mental work and breaks down in a sweat, and becomes excited and irritable and disturbed. Great disturbance of the emotions; complaints lasting for days and weeks from excitement of the emotions; from worrying, from vexation, or a general emotional disturbance is prostrated.
"Inability to apply himself."
Inability to do good thinking for some time after such excitement, disturbance or worry. It is very useful in complaints from prolonged worry, from prolonged application to business, from excitement.
It is full of a peculiar kind of mental feeling, differing quite considerably from most remedies; he feels his exhaustion of mind, and it seems to him that this weakness, and this inability to do and to think connectedly, must be going towards insanity, he broods over it, he is convinced that he is insane, or about to become insane, that he is getting weak-minded, and he looks it, too, because what he has in his mind is this: that he is becoming insane or weak-minded and he thinks people will observe it.
He thinks people look at him suspiciously, and he looks at them suspiciously, and he wonders why they do not say something to him about it.
He thinks he is going insane, and that other people are observing his state of mind, and he keeps that in his mind most of the time. He thinks of it day-times, and he gets greatly roused up over it; he thinks of it nights, and it keeps him awake.
He lies awake late at night thinking. Calcarea leads to little ideas, that is, it compels the mind to littleness, to little ideas, or to dwell on little things, but his mind, as it were, is forced to dwell upon things that he cannot put aside.
When the Calcarea patient begins to relate to his friends how he feels they all naturally say to him, "Why don't you put that aside; that doesn't amount to anything,"
but to him it is a big thing, and he cannot put it aside; all these little things combine to convince him that he is going crazy. he cannot calculate, he cannot do deep thinking, he cannot dwell upon deep things; he may have been a philosopher, and he has lost his ability to think out things in philosophy.
He has lost his mental depth. he forms conclusions out of his emotions rather than from his intelligence. He forms conclusions about things as he wants them to be. You would almost think he wants to grow crazy, he keeps talking about it so much.
He is unable to accept any sort of argument, and this grows worse and worse. He is unable to accept the assurance of his physician, in whom he has always had confidence. It is no use, it seems, to try to reason with him; yet he is not so far gone but he can reason about other things except his own mental state.
He imagines things; and the things he imagines you will really wonder at his dwelling upon them so, because they are such little things. And so it is when he goes into insanity, or imbecility, or a general breakdown.
It is a passive state, in which he sits and thinks about his little affairs, and his little things that amount to nothing at all, and he sits and sits, the text says,
"Sits and breaks sticks, or bends pins all day long with his fingers."
Does little things, and in this way he keeps himself busy, wears himself out more and more. Any amount of thinking be comes impossible. It is almost impossible for him to come to a conclusion, for he never figures it twice alike.
He cannot add and subtract even in the simplest forms. Now, he thinks about this matter so much and thinks everybody else is watching him, until finally the instant he closes his eyes he has visions, just as soon as he gets down quiet and thinks
"Now I will go to sleep, I will get rid of all this,"
and he closes his eyes to sleep, then he must get them open as quick as possible, he is in a state of excitement, for he sees horrid little spooks; he cannot keep his mind clear.
He cannot go to sleep because his thoughts trouble him, and he sees all sorts of things. There is no congruity in his mind. We know that strong intelligence puts aside such follies, but these are just the things that Calcarea patients dwell upon.
Talking to himself. He lies in bed, or sits, when be is alone, and carries on a general conversation with every conceivable individual he has had to do with, on every conceivable subject; and it multiplies and it grows, and he imagines it is all real.
We see how far that is removed from the healthy mind, and yet he is not fit for the insane asylum, with all of these strange things, for when he is roused he does carry on a conversation, and he does as ordinary
people do.
When he is alone, when he has nobody to talk with him, he does these strange things. He is controlled and dominated when he is in company, to a great extent, and hence these things are not brought out.
He carries out that same idea when he becomes delirious or insane. Picks his fingers, and does all sorts of peculiar little things. Sees visions and faces of persons when eyes are closed.
"Imagines some one is walking beside her."
In the proving of Sil. that was observed very strongly. It has been observed in Petroleum, and in Calcarea. In a perfect state of health, with a strong, vigorous intelligence, it is not likely to be felt, but in nervous people, and especially in women, it is common.
"Mental aberration with horrid visions. Sees dogs crowding around him, fights them off." Here is a sensation, occurring in nervous women, "Feels as if she would like to run up and down, and scream."
Feels as if she could not help it, she must scream. That occurs in persons overwrought, dreadfully excited from a loss in the household by death. The mother loses her child, or husband; or a young girl loses her
intended. She is broken-hearted, and greatly excited. It is a hysterical state. And yet I have seen the same in men.
I remember one. It came upon him from business cares. He had that same feeling; he would walk up and down the house, he said he felt as if he must fly or jump out of a window, or do some thing. That is analogous to the mental state found in hysteria, or a great state of nervous excitement.
"She thinks and talks of nothing but murder, fire, rats, etc."
That is that same idea of talking about little things and foolish things. Things that are not interesting to anybody, And yet I have seen these things in patients and I would ask them why they did it. It is generally said,
"I tried a good while to stop it, and when I could not I just kept right on at it, for it seemed to do me good." "She thinks and talks of murder, fire, rats, etc."
Your patient may talk about other foolish things, but it is only to il lustrate the idea that she sits and talks about foolish things, and can not control herself; thinking, thinking, or expressing it, talking, talking, talking.
Violent screaming spells. And then the Calcarea patient will refuse to talk, will say nothing. She may talk to herself when alone, but will decline to enter into conversation, and will sit perfectly silent.
A Calcarea patient sometimes takes an aversion to work, and quits work. He will quit a most thriving business, and go home and do nothing, after being fatigued in carrying on the business until it- reaches a most thriving condition. He says business is not good for him.
He is tired of business, and when he goes to his business again it seems as if it would drive him crazy. He does not want to see it, he does not want to know anything about it.
Of course, you can readily see that it is not so much in the Calcarea patient that he is driven to, weakness and fatigue from distress in business, although it has that, but that which I am speaking about is that he has overworked until he has given out, and right in the midst of his success he quits his business and goes home, and leaves all-it looks just as if he were lazy.
If you look at him you come to the conclusion that he is lazy. Yet it is an insanity; not the laziness that belongs to tramp nature, though that also might be cured many times. He has been industrious, and all at once takes a turn. A great change occurs in the mind, and he takes on symptoms. It is not such persons as were born that way, born lazy, never would work; but those that become lazy.
It is like the symptom in a pious upright man, whose walk and conversation has been upright but all at once he turns and commences to swear. Of course we know that individual is insane. On the other hand, we have patients that have been only ordinarily industrious that develop an insanity for work, and it seems they have ability in that insane industry to work almost night and day; they are up early and late.
It is a sick state. So when we see in the Repertory "Industry" it does not mean an ordinarily industrious state but one that is exaggerated into a symptom. He has become so industrious that he has a mania for work.
"Whimpering. Low-spirited and melancholy."
It is a strange thing to see a bright little girl of 8 or 9 years old taking on sadness, melancholy, and commencing to talk about the future world, and the angels, and that she wants to die and go there, and she is sad, and wants to read the Bible all day.
That is a strange thing; and yet Calcarea has cured that. Ars. has cured that state, and also Lach. They area little inclined to be precocious, and they have attended the Sunday-school, and they have taken too seriously the things they have learned.
Children sad and unhappy, and old people who take on a loathing of life, become weary of life. That is a good deal like Aurum. In going over Aurum | explained that, and dwelt upon it, that the highest love is the love of life; and when an individual ceases to love his own life, and is weary of it, and loathes it, and wants to die, he is on the border line of insanity.
In fact, that is an insanity of the will. You have only to look with an observing eye to see that one may be insane in the affections, or insane in the intelligence. One may remain quite intact, and the other one be
destroyed.
We find in Calcarea both equally disturbed. One patient may be insane in his voluntary system, so that all of his loves are perverted; he has no affection that is like what it used to be, like it was when be was well.
Antipathy to his family or some member of his family.
Or, he may have the affection fairly intact, but no intelligence, and does all sorts of strange things. He is full of fear.
Weary of life; hopelessness, anxiety. The world is black.
"Fear that something sad or terrible will happen. Fears that she will. lose her reason, or that people will observe her confusion of mind."
"Fear of death; of consumption; of misfortune; of being alone."
Fear abounds, especially when the voluntary system is disturbed. She is startled at every noise. He can't sleep sq that the body rests or the mind rests. He is disturbed in his sleep with horrible dreams. His sleep is a restless one.
"Great anxiety and oppression. Restlessness and palpitation. Despairing; hopeless."
These symptoms have to be coupled and connected with that leucophlegmatic, pale, flabby, sickly individual.
"Child cross and fretful. Easily frightened."
Many complaints after exertion of the mind. Many complaint after excitement, chagrin or fright.
He is so weak in his circulation, so much disturbed in the heart, it palpitates from every excitement. He is out of breath from every physical exertion; and these take part so much in the circulation of blood in the
body, have so much to do with circulation of blood in the brain, have so much to do with the intellect, with the sensorium, that we see at once vertigo on almost all occasions, intermingled with all sorts of symptoms.
Fear, anxiety, and vertigo. If his. emotions stir him up he becomes dizzy. From going upstairs the blood mounts to the head, and he becomes dizzy. Confusion of mind and vertigo from mental exertion. If he becomes shocked, or has bad news, or has any mental excitement or chagrin, this vertigo will come out.
Confusion of mind, determination of blood to the head, cold extremities, covered with sweat, with vertigo. "Vertigo, when climbing into high places;"
that is the effort of going up. The blood rushes to the head and he becomes dizzy.
"On going upstairs or up a hill. On suddenly rising, or turning the head, even when at rest."
Head: One of the most striking symptoms of the head of the Calcarea patient is the sweat, the sweat of the head upon the slightest exertion. He will sweat on the face when he sweats nowhere else, and his head is covered with cold sweat when he is comfortable in other places about the body.
The same thing is true about the feet. When his feet become very cold they will sweat. When they are warm they will sweat. You would naturally think that a person going into a cold room would stop his sweating. But sometimes the Calcarea patient will break out in a sweat, upon the head, and upon the feet, in a cold room,
He sweats upon the forehead, so that every draft of air makes him chilly, and this brings on headache. Coldness of the whole scalp, so he has to wrap up the head. Yet during congestions, the head is hot.
So it has at times great heat in the head. The Calcarea headaches are stupefying, they are benumbing; they bring on confusion of mind.
The Calcarea patient has a catarrh in the nose, with more or less discharge; at his best he has considerable discharge. But he goes into a cold place, the discharge is slacked up, and he gets a headache. Headache over the eyes. Congestion of the head; back of the head.
"Tearing headache above the eyes down to nose,” is a strong symptom of Calcarea.
It seems sometimes as if a great wedge were lip in there. This is relieved by very hot applications. It is relieved in the dark; it is aggravated in the daylight. He must go into dark room and lie down for relief.
Sometimes this headache is ameliorated by lying down in the dark. This headache continues to grow worse during the day, until in the evening it becomes so severe that it is at tended with nausea and vomiting.
It is one of the forms of constitutional headache, is a headache that sometimes occurs once in two weeks. Headache every seven days, or headache once in two weeks. Periodical headaches. Sick headache, the old- fashioned American sick-headache.
There is commonly a periodicity belonging to it, of seven to fourteen days, but again, it comes on whenever he is exposed, by riding in the wind, for he is a very chilly patient, if he becomes really chilled or very cold, he gets a headache, a sick-headache.
Then, again, it has pain in the left side of the head. One-sided headache. Headache worse from noise, from talking, but ameliorated in the evening, from lying in the dark. It has headache in the temples, and this headache seems to draw through to the root of the nose.
The headaches from the supraorbital region draw through to the nose. Headaches in the temples seem to produce a feeling of tightness, a feeling of great tension in the forehead. Headaches worse from motion, from walking, from talking.
Most of the Calcarea headaches, as soon as they become severe, are attended with pulsation. The pulsation is so strong that the patient is not satisfied by merely saying it is a pulsation, he describes it as hammering. Most of the pains are pressive or tearing.
"Concussive headaches."
Stitching, pulsating pains in the head, as if it would split. Headaches worse from walking, and from a jar. Sometimes he feels a coldness in the head, it seems as if the cold head is numb, cold as if made of wood. He
sometimes feels this numbness, and describes it as if he had a cap, sometimes as if there were a helmet, on the head.
Now, all of these sensations are difficult to describe, but sometimes they are one and the same thing. All the headaches of Calcarea, are more or less congestive. It is a peculiar feature of Calcarea, that the more marked the congestion of internal parts, the colder the surface becomes.
With chest troubles, and stomach troubles, and bowel troubles, the feet and hands become like ice, W covered with sweat; and he lies in bed sometimes with a fever in the rest of his body, and the scalp covered with cold sweat.
That is strange. You cannot account for that by any process of reasoning in pathology, and when a thing is so strange that it cannot be accounted, for, it become very valuable as descriptive of the remedy, and is one that cannot generally be left out when prescribing for a patient.
That is almost a general state, it is so marked. It has burning in the vertex, and this is often present coldness of the forehead, or the whole head may feel cold except a burning spot on the vertex. Calcarea will again have cold head and icy cold feet when walking in cold air or in very cold weather; but as soon as the feet get warm, they go to the other extreme, and burn so that he puts them out of bed.
This has often led inexperienced prescribers to prescribe Sulph., because that is a keynote of Sulph. All keynote prescribers give Sulph. whenever the patient puts the feet out of bed, but a number of remedies have burning feet, hot feet, so we are not limited to Sulph. Calcarea has affections of the bones of the skull, the outer part of the head.
Slow formation of bone. The fontanelles remain open a long time. It has hydrocephalic conditions, effusion in the membranes, and the bones do not grow and keep pace with the growth of the head, and hence the sutures commence to separate and the head grows wider, and larger all the time, with hydrocephalus.
In hydrocephalic children this sweating head is a common feature. The child lies at night upon the pillow, and the sweat pours from the head and wets the pillow all around; especially sweating at night.
In persons suffering from softening of the brain, the pillow is wet all around the head. Children going through difficult dentition have dreadful times in their dreams, they screech out in the night, and the pillow is wet all around their head.
Old plethoric patients, broken down constitutions, fat, flabby, lymphatic patients, with enlarged glands, with sweating of the head, cold sweating of the head. The hair falls out, not in the regular way such as occurs in old ago bit in patches here and there.
You see a bald spot on the side of the head, or the back of the head; a tuft of hair has come out, or in two or three places. Then it has eruptions upon the head and face; eczema that we find in children and infants.
"Thick scabs on the head, with yellow pus."
Eyes: Offensive eruptions. The eye comes in for a share of troubles, and Calcarea is one of the best friends the oculist has, if he knows how to use it. It is not especially suitable for every inflammation, but in those fat, flabby constitutions, where every cold settles in the eyes, and produces an inflammation, and this goes on for a few days, and ulceration begins, then study Calcarea.
Vesicles are formed and break and spread into an ulcer. From exposure of the feet in water, from riding in the wind, from cold, damp weather he gets eye troubles. Ulceration of the cornea. In all of the complaints of the eyes and of the head the photophobia is so marked that the Calcarea subject when he is at all disturbed cannot even stand ordinary light, and to be out in the sunlight is extremely painful, and many times inflammations are started from merely going into a bright sunlight, from steady looking, and from straining the eyes.
All kinds of exertions bring on headaches and eye troubles. Tension, because one muscle is weak. There is a disturbance of accommodation. Worse from every exertion of the eyes; you see that is like its generals, that is, aggravated from exertion.
He cannot endure any prolonged exertion; you see that is just as true of his parts as the whole. You know that reading, writing and looking at one thing all are marked exertions. With Calcarea, the part itself is worse from exertion, and the whole body is worse from exertion.
Calcarea has cured cataract. Calcarea has other disturbances of the eyes, in connection with head troubles, in connection with fevers, and when he is out of sorts from great exertion; he so easily gets into a fidgety state, confusion of mind that is almost a delirium, and on closing the eyes he sees the most horrible visions, specters, ghosts.
Long before any disturbance can be observed in the tissues, or in the retina, or any disturbance of the eye by looking into it with the ophthalmoscope he will complain of seeing smoke, or steam in the air before his field of vision, as if looking through a veil, as if looking through a cloud, all meaning the same thing.
"Dim vision." His vision is weak.
The muscles are weak. He suffers from dim vision, which is going on gradually to blindness as he grows increasingly weak. All of his eye symptoms, and his headaches, and his nervous symptoms arc aggravated from reading, from writing, from looking steadily at one thing.
He is very much exhausted after such an exertion and will have tearing pains over the eyes, behind the eyes in the head. That is a peculiar kind of a headache, such as he is in the habit of having. It may be in any part of head.
Called eye-strain. It is a wonderful remedy for eye-strain (Onosmodium). Calcarea has cured many cases of opacity of the cornea (Bar, iod.). In an old case a cure can never be promised. It is one of the results of disease, and we never know when we are going to remove the results of disease, because the intelligent homeopath never prescribes for the results of disease. He prescribes for the patient. An opacity itself, when it is present, is not a symptom, but a result of disease.
Often when a patient is prescribed for on his general symptoms, such a state of opacity of the cornea will, after a while, begin to pass away. The patient grows better, feels better himself. His symptoms commence to subside, and after the symptoms have subsided pathological conditions will commence to subside.
Do not be discouraged in prescribing if the pathological conditions do not go away; but if all the symptoms of the patient have gone away, and the patient is eating well, and is sleeping well, and doing well, do not feel that it is impossible for that opacity of the cornea to go away, for sometimes it will.
I have known patients to come back, years later, even after I had given them up as cured, as their symptoms had all disappeared, and I was foolish enough to say to the patient,
"Well, I do not suppose this condition will ever go away, but you are all well, there is nothing to prescribe on, there is not much use of your taking any more medicine,” but in six months from that time the patient would come back to me and say:
"Doctor, do you suppose the treatment you gave me had anything to do with this trouble going away? It has nearly all disappeared."
I only tell you this to give you an idea how long it takes to restore order, for nature herself to replace the bad tissue and put healthy tissue in that same place, to restore an organ. It takes time, and it is best that we should not be surprised. it may be that the medicine has done all it can do.
Here is another thing I have seen: even when there were no symptoms left, and after waiting a considerable time and there were no symptoms, I have seen another dose of the same medicine that was given on the last symptoms give the patient a great lift, and pathological conditions commence to go way.
So Calcarea is a great friend to the oculist, and every physician ought to be just as good a prescriber as the oculist can be, for he prescribes for the patient. So must the oculist. In prescribing I am in doubt whether
there can be any such thing as a specialty, because the homoeopathic physician prescribes for the patient. He prescribes for the patient, whether he has eye disease, or car disease, or throat disease, or lung disease, or liver disease, etc.
Ears: In the ear we have a great deal of trouble. It produces thick yellow discharge from the ears. Cold, chilly weather brings on ear trouble; quite likely from becoming cold or chilled, from an exposure, or from a sudden change of cold damp weather he has additional complaints in the ears.
While he is at his best the idea holds good here as in other catarrhal conditions, there is copious discharge. But from exposure and cold this slacks up a little, and when it does there is a little inflammation, and like enough throbbing, and headache. That occurs every time from exposure.
Whether the catarth is in the nose, the eyes, or the ears, there will be headache. The Calcarea patient is so easily disturbed from cold weather and exposure, he is so sensitive to the cold, that it is next to impossible for him to dress and protect himself. He is flabby and soft, easily disturbed, sensitive to his surroundings.
If it is an ear trouble, he may have difficult hearing, abscess of the middle ear, catarrh of the Eustachian tubes, etc., but all of these bring on headaches; and around about the ear the glands are all affected.
Nose: The catarrh of the nose is extremely troublesome. Old lingering stubborn catarrhs, with thick yellow discharge; great crusts from the nose. In the morning he blows out enormous blackish, bloody chunks.
He breathes part of the night through the nose, and then his nose clogs up so that he breathes, through the mouth. It has cured a great many times polypi of the nose.
The homeopathic physician, trusting so much to his symptoms, knows so well the remedy after studying the case, that be very likely will prescribe for the patient on the symptoms alone. He says:
This patient needs Calcarea, there is no doubt about it. He prescribes for him and sends him away.
After three or four weeks the patient comes back with a gelatinous looking tough thing on a handkerchief, and says:
"Doctor, look there at what came out of my nose. Do you suppose your medicine had anything to do with that?"
Perhaps you did not know he had polypus, it does not make any difference, your prescription cannot be any different if he has polypi in the nose, and you do not know it is there; you cannot by any process of torsion remove it before you prescribe, so you will have to leave that torsion to those that do not know about Homoeopathy; and hence the examination is not so important as it is to those who prescribe for the polypi, and forget about the patient.
Affections of the bones of the nose. That is, the catarrhs go on so long, and they are so deep-seated, that the bones of the nose and the cartilage of the nose are infiltrated, any they break down.
Then operators cut out bones, remove cartilage, and perform operations too numerous to mention; and every one must have the same operation; but in order for him to be cured, he must even after that go to an homoeopathic physician. He should first be cured and then if there is anything to be removed let him be operated on.
Face: The face is sickly, cold, covered with sweat. Sweats on the slightest exertion, and sometimes it sweats in the night, on the forehead.
"Cold sweat on the face. Face pale and cachectic,” such as we see in advanced cases of cancer, and consumption.
Face sallow, pale, sickly, dropsical. Eruptions on the face. Eruptions about the lips; and the lips are chapped and the mouth is raw. The lips are cracked and bleeding. Painful swelling on the parotid glands; painful swelling of the sub-lingual and sub-maxillary glands.
The glands all take part in the Calcarea troubles.
Throat: Calcarea is a medicine for chronic sore throats. The throat appearance itself is not always sufficient to prescribe on, but the complaints in the throat are those that come on in persons taking cold so frequently that the patient has not time to get over one before be goes into another, and this engrafts upon him a chronic sore throat.
It may in the beginning be a Bell. throat, which is quite likely, but before he gets over it he has taken another cold. Remember that this is a part of the Calcarea patient, that he takes cold so easily; he takes cold from every, draft, from very exposure, and from damp weather.
When getting over a Bell. sore throat - about the time he thinks he is over it he takes a new cold. Perhaps it has been relieved two or three times with Bell., and then it settles down into a chronic state, and there are little red patches, perhaps little ulcers in the throat, this extends all over . It extends to the roof of the mouth, a sore tongue, and a constant dry, choking feeling in the pharynx, covering the tonsils and extending, up into the posterior nares, filling with thick, yellow mucus.
Chronic inflammation. The uvula may be puffed; swollen. "Parts swollen, red, tumid," but it patches.
The throat very painful on swallowing; dry, choking feeling. Stomach: The stomach in Calcarea is slow in its action. "Food taken into the stomach remains."
It does not digest, it turns sour.
"Sour vomiting."
Milk sours. Milk disagrees; the digestion is also slow, feeble. He has a feeling of tumefaction and fullness; enlargement after eat ing; and everything sours in the stomach; everything disorders the stomach.
Weak digestion. The Calcarea patient has a very strong longing for eggs. Little children crave eggs; at every meal they will eat eggs, and eggs, will digest better than anything else. It is very seldom that little children naturally long for eggs; children with cold feet, emaciated extremities, large heads, enlarged abdomen; stomach distended like an inverted saucer, rounded out; bloated abdomen, and slender extremities; cold and sensitive to cold; pale skin; pale, waxy surface.
Then, there is complete loss of appetite, no desire for any kind of food. If any desire at all, it is for eggs. Aversion to meat; aversion to warm food.
This with enlarged glands, with goitre. Flatulency. Sour vomiting; sour diarrhoea; that is, it has a pungent, sour odor, especially in children.
In infants living on milk, the milk passes in an undigested form; the stool is so sour that it is pungent. It excoriates the parts, and keeps the nates raw in infants where the diaper comes in contact with the parts.
There are times when the abdomen is emaciated; the gases go out and the abdomen sometimes becomes flabby; but most of the time it is distended with flatulence. When it is flabby it can be observed that there are nodules in the abdomen.
The lymphatic glands are hard, and sometimes can be felt through the emaciated abdomen. There is a tubercular tendency, and tabes mesenterica is one, of the natural endings of the lime constitution, with this we get the glandular affections of the bowels.
Tubercular deposits in the mesenteric glands. Diarrhoea comes on sour; watery diarrhoea; gradual emaciation, especially of the extremities. Every cold brings on more indigestion, and more sour vomiting.
Diarrhoea that can't be stopped, because every time he gets a cold it renews the diarrhoea. When it, is an acute attack Dulc. often relieves it but when it has recurred several times Dulc. can no longer relieve it and Calcarea then becomes one of the remedies.
Again, it is one of the most useful medicines in old, lingering, stubborn cases of constipation. When there is only a moderate diarrhoea the stool is white; and when this constipation is present, the stool is white, or like chalk.
In infants taking milk you can account for the white or pale stool, because of the milk; but when the patient does not live on milk, and lives on ordinary substances, the stool becomes bileless and is very light colored; is yellow or white; and in the constipation, often the stool is very light colored and hard.
Calcarea has a kind of indigestion, a fermentation that favors the formation of worms, so that Calcarea babies are sometimes wormy.
Pass worms in the stool, and vomit worms. Calcarea so corrects this indigestion, when the symptoms agree, that worms no longer hatch out. The symptoms disappear, and we really wonder what becomes of the worms.
The idea with the homoeopathic physician is not to give vermifuges, but to so correct the digestion that worms will not thrive; and it is true that worms will not thrive in the healthy stomach and intestines. Whether they leave by expulsion or whether they are destroyed, or what becomes of them, I do not know.
To remove them by physicking them out, and by vermifuges, only makes a bad matter worse, because it increases the indigestion, it increases the turmoil. So it is with all worms in the stomach and rectum; all those worms will come if they are favored with just exactly the right kind of fluids to hatch out in.
They come, and they grow. I suppose at least twenty-five times in the last twenty years have I known Calcarea to bring away tape worm, and in most instances | did not know it was present; but I simply prescribed for the patient. I was not aware of its existence. It is so with many remedies, but this more than others.
Genitals: The Calcarea patient is weak sexually, with general relaxation and weakness. Sometimes an inordinate carving, sometimes an overwhelming desire keeps him awake at nights. But weak; weak in this way, that any indulgence is followed by weak back, sweating, weakness in general, so that he is compelled to abstain because of the sufferings.
The woman is affected in a similar way. You need not be surprised, when you hear all of the constitutional weakness, that it is a common, thing for Calcarea women to be sterile. So tired, so relaxed; wholly unfit for reproduction.
And the same as in the male, she suffers from lassitude, swelling, wakefulness, and weakness in general after every coition. The parts feel relaxed. The uterus drags down. Sensation as if parts would be forced out. State of general weakness and general relaxation of the sexual organs of both male and female. Calcarea has a tendency to grow warts and polypoid growths, pedunculated growths, that bleed easily, that are soft and
spongy.
The woman flows too much at the menstrual period; too long, and, of course, this naturally brings her around too soon. Often every three weeks, lasting a week, with a copious flow. Menstrual period too soon, lasting too long, and profuse. Calcarea is not always indicated; not unless all of the symptoms go together to make up the Calcarea patient.
Sometimes it may occur to your mind to say, that with five or six key-notes, certainly you would give Calcarea; but suppose you did have five or six key-notes of Calcarea, and the patient should be a Puls. patient, would you expect to cure her with Calcarea?
Suppose the patient always avoided warm things and much clothing, and wanted the cold open air, and still had a dozen key-notes, you would find every time that Calcarea would fail. Unless you combine the particulars with the things that are general, and the generals with the particulars, unless the remedy fits the patient from within out, generally and particularly, a cure need not be expected. That is why I say, do not prescribe on key-notes, but upon the symptoms of the patient.
This great state of relaxation which we always have in every Calcarea patient is also manifested in leucorrhea, copious, thick, constant leucorrhea, discharging day and night. Leucorrhea that is acrid, keeping up an itching, and smarting, and burning,
"Leucorrhoea thick and yellow,” from one menstrual period to another, and some times it intermingles with the menstrual flow.
"Vaginal polypi. Burning soreness in the genitals" from leucorrhoea. "Itching and rawness" from leucorrhoea.
Hemorrhage of the uterus from over-lifting; from excitement; from shocks; from anything that greatly disturbs; from fear, from any great emotion, or from straining the muscles. Such are the conditions of relaxation and weakness. Inability to strain the muscles, or to exert himself mentally or physically.
The complaints of pregnancy are generally those of great relaxation and weakness. Threatened abortion. After delivery, weakness and prostration; sweating. Weakness from nursing.
Voice: The Calcarea voice is that of painless hoarseness. The vocal cords are tired, and cannot endure strain; almost a paralytic weakness. Sometimes a copious flow of mucus from the larynx. Much irritation in the larynx, but weakness. Not that burning and rawness that we find in Bell. and Phos., but painless hoarseness. In Phos. it is painful, in Bell. it is very painful. He cannot speak without pain.
But in Calcarea he wonders why he has so much trouble in the larynx, because he has no feeling in it. This goes on from bad to worse, and with the tubercular tendency, look out for tubercular laryngitis. Given early it may keep off such a tubercular tendency. It has cured tubercular laryngitis.
Much rattling of mucus; rattling breathing; coarse rattling; that is, much mucus in the trachea, in the larynx, in the bronchial tubes, in the chest. Great dyspnoea.
The dyspnoea comes on from going up stairs, from walking against the wind. Anything that bas any exertion in it will bring on the dyspnoea. We find this in asthma, weak heart, weak chest and in threatening phthisis.
That state of the lungs you will know very often by the kind of breathing; because all that are going into phthisis are tired and weak. He is too tired and weak to make any effort at breathing, so that he has difficult in going up stairs, climbing a hill, walking against the wind.
Chest: The chest troubles furnishes one of our best fields for Calcarea.
We having spiting of blood prolonged cough; copious expectoration of thick yellow mucus, or even pus; ulceration, or abscess. Tickling cough. We have, in threatening chest trouble, the beginning emaciation, the pallor, the sensitiveness to cold, changes, and to the cold air and to wet weather and to winds.
He takes colds and they all settle into the chest; gradual emaciation in the limbs; always so tired. It corresponds to just such constitutional weakness as precedes, or is present in the first stages of phthisis. It stops the patient taking cold, which is the very beginning of it. The patient will begin to feel better after taking Calcarea, and it improves his general state, and it will even encyst tubercular deposits.
It turns them from a caseous into a calcareous form, and cysts have been found in the chest long afterwards. Patients have lived a long time and improved, and gone into a general state of health, when quite well advanced with tubercular deposits. Of course, when any person is well into a tubercular condition, it may be expected that he will go.
Do not believe or think favorably of cure for consumption. Every little while we have some one. Coming out with something or other that cures consumption, a new cure.
Every one who know much about the real nature of phthisical conditions, cannot have much confidence in such things, and I certainly lose respect for an individual who has a consumption cure. He must either be crazy or something worse.
Generally he is after the money that may be in it. Hardly any one who knows anything about it can conscientiously present a consumption cure to the world.
To prevent those things is what we want to do, and this is the great sphere of Calcarea. The expectoration is sweetish very often, like Phos. and Stannum. White, yellow, thick.
We might go over all the general symptoms here, the soreness, the tenderness, the kind of pains, the lassitude, and a great many symptoms of that sort, they are too numerous to mention, but they are non descriptive, for the reason that after you get these pains and study them carefully, you are no better off. You must study the constitution of Calcarea, the nature of Calcarea, its character.
There are spine symptom s; plenty’ of them. Weak; all degrees of weakness. The Calcarea patient is so weak in the back that he slides down in the chair while sitting; cannot sit right in his chair.
Rests on the back of his head. The back of his chair and the back of his head come in contact. A weak spine, a sensitive spine, and the glands of the neck are swollen. Again, a marked condition of the spine is where the lime element is deficient, and we soon get deformity; curvature.
It may be surprising to you to hear that Calcarea is a great help, and has sometimes cured that without any brace or support whatever, when taken early.
You take infants manifesting a weakness of the spine, let them lie flat on their back in bed, put them on the indicated remedy - it is sometimes Calcarea - and in a little while that knuckling will cease, and the little one will sit up straight.
Such wonderful things occur under the use of Calcarea, when the symptoms agree. In the extremities we have all the rheumatic conditions that it is possible to describe.
Gouty affections of the joints, with enlarged joints; gouty conditions, especially of the small joints, of the toe and finger. Rheumatic complaints of the joints from every exposure, from every change of the weather to cold, especially if it is cold and damp.
The feet are always cold, or cold and damp, except at night in bed after piling clothing upon the feet more than any other part of the body, then the feet begin to get warm, and then they often go to the other extreme and burn; and so they burn at night in bed.
But the feet are so cold that the patient has to put more clothing on the feet than the body will endure. Cold, damp feet. Late walking. Clumsiness; awkwardness; stiffness.
Rheumatic conditions. Stiffness belongs to Calcarea all over. Stiff on beginning to move; stiff at night on rising from a seat. Stiffness in all joints on beginning to move; and if it turns cold or there is a cold rain, the Calcarea patient always suffers; suffers from coldness, stiffness, rheumatism has rheumatism in every cold change in the weather.
The sleep is greatly disturbed. Late going to sleep, sometimes not till 2, 3 or 4 o'clock. Full of ideas; when closing the eyes horrible visions. Grinding the teeth. A child in sleep, chews and swallows and grinds the teeth. Sleeplessness a good part of the night. Cold feet at night in bed.
Calcarea Fluorica
This chemical union of lime and fluoric acid gives us a remedy with a new nature and properties. However conversant one may be with either or both of these elements, he could not predict the curative powers held in this double remedy.
I refer to its ability to cure indurated infiltrations of glands, cellular tissues and bony formations.
A nodule in the course of a tendon and exostosis, a stony bard gland, bony infiltration in the periosteum, rice bodies in cartilages have been cured by this remedy wonderful to tell, when there was a paucity of symptoms. It will cure of course when symptoms agree, but it needs proving in order that individualization may be oftener possible.
A recurrent fibroid in the hallow of the knee was removed once by the knife, but returned, and grew to the size of a fist. The leg was drawn up to forty-five degrees, and the knee became immovable.
This wonderful remedy was prescribed on the symptoms of the case and the hardness of the tumor.
The tumor gradually dwindled, the limb became normal and as good as ever; this patient has since born a healthy child is still perfectly free from the trouble. It is now ten years since she was cured.
The patient is sensitive to cold, to drafts, to changes in the weather, and to damp weather. The symptoms are ameliorated by heat and by warm applications. The symptoms are worse during rest.

Camphor
The camphor bottle is, a great mischief in the house, as camphor antidotes most of our remedies. Camphor in potentized form will cure many complaints.
It is suitable in some acute complaints attended with nervous excitement, even to frenzy, with spasms and convulsions and finally exhaustion. The Camphor state is one of convulsions or coldness.
In the most acute period of the Camphor excitement, the excitability and frenzy of the patient are extreme, or he goes into the other extreme, in which the irritability is lost and there is loss of sensation, unconsciousness and coldness.
The two extremes may be seen in one patient, one earlier and the other later. He may go from the extreme of mental excitement and violence to one of prostration and exhaustion, in which the body is blue and cold and yet must be uncovered.
Mind: In the mental state, there is anxiety and extreme fear; fear of persons, of strange spheres, of the dark; the dark is filled with imaginary specters; he dare not get out of bed in the dark; everything that moves is a specter and the inanimate things of the room become alive and terrify him.
Frenzy. Coupled with this, there is kidney and urinary trouble, like that of Cantharis, and because of this similarity, the two remedies are both complementary and antidotal to each other. If a woman has poisoned herself with Cantharis, and there is present the frenzy and excitement, Camphor will act as an antidote.
The details of the mental symptoms are worthy of much consideration. The patient goes into a state not unlike imbecility, and the appearance is as if it had come on slowly. The mind and memory are gone. He closes the eyes, seemingly asleep, and answers no questions. Delirious with the heat, rage and mania, wants to jump out of bed or out of the window. Screams and calls for help. Tosses anxiously in bed.
Anxiety and almost loss of consciousness. These symptoms will indicate Camphor in puerperal fever, in congestion of the brain, or in shock from violent inflammation of organs. Confusion comes from the shock and comes with violence.
The more violently the patient suffers, the sooner he is cold, and when he is cold, he must uncover even ina cold room. This is somewhat like Secale. In Secale the patient, when cold, wants to uncover and to be ina cold room, and it also has frenzy, and so there is nothing in what we have yet seem to distinguish Secale from Camph.
But there is another thing that runs through Camph., by which a distinction can be made. The coldness, frenzy and heat very often intermingle. When the Camphor patient is becoming cold, he has spells of heat which come over him; flashes of heat intermingle with rending, tearing, burning pains, either in the inflamed organ or along the nerves.
The patient is a most troublesome patient to nurse; nobody and nothing suits. If an inflammation of the bladder comes on, there is intense pain and tenderness, and from the shock of the suffering the mind is ina state of frenzy.
Coldness then comes on and the patient wants to be uncovered, wants cold air, wants the windows open, but before all this can be done, a flash of beat comes on and then he wants the covers on, and the register turned on, and wants a hot iron and hot bottles; but this stage now passes off, and while the nurse is bringing the hot irons he wants her to open the windows and have everything cool.
You will see at once that these are serious cases. This occurs with opisthotonos, convulsions, inflammation of the brain, liver, kidney, bladder, coming on from violent shock and cold with great exhaustion. You will see this in one who has worked for hours for his life, and when the excitement is over reaction sets in and it is like a whirlwind; he has worked until he is exhausted and now he is prostrated, cold and blue; here is the
sphere where the old woman with her Camphor bottle has established a reputation, but potentized Camphor will do more for him than the Camphor bottle, it will put him into a refreshing sleep.
Menopause: It is useful in the climacteric period with flushes of heat and sweat in a warm room; the limbs and abdomen are very cold and she suffers from cold when uncovered and sweats copiously when covered. She cannot endure covering to warm her limbs though she suffers from cold.
Head: The head is full of pain; throbbing pain. Contractive feeling as if laced together in the cerebellum. The whole back of the head and neck throb like hammers, worse from bending head forward; burning and stinging. Frontal headaches.
Cholera: We have heard about Camphor in cholera, which is a disease that brings the patient down quickly. The face is cold, blue and shriveled, without much sweat, in the cases that would make one think of Camphor.
There is not much discharge from the bowels, not much vomiting and not much sweat; but suddenly he becomes cold, blue and collapsed, as it were paralyzed and goes into a stupor.
Convulsions with frothing at the mouth. Blue lips, lockjaw, tetanus. Cold sweat on the face with vomiting. Erysipelatous appearance of face.
There is a desire to drink without thirst. There is also insatiable thirst; he is not satisfied with incredible quantities of cold water. Cannot get it cold enough, and cannot get enough, but he soon vomits it up.
The gastric irritation is marked. Everything is vomited. The tongue is blue and cold and the breath is cold. Everything coming out of the body is cold. The air as it leaves the chest feels like that from a cellar, like Carbo v. and Verat.
The tongue is cold and trembling. Such states are found in cholera. All through the cold stage there is burning. The inside of the body seems to burn, or there is a sense of internal smarting like a rawness or a sense of burning without heat.
The pain in the stomach in gastritis is so violent that the anguish on the face is equal to that in Arsenic; a deathly anguish is felt in his stomach and he feels that he must die. Burning, rending, tearing pain in the stomach, with retching and vomiting.
Cramps in stomach and bowels and spreading to other parts of the body until there are convulsions and opisthotonos.
Anguish at the pit of the stomach drives him to despair. Heat in the stomach, Cold feeling in the stomach. Abdomen is full of colic and burning. Cold feeling in the abdomen.
Cholera stools; rice water discharges, with anxiety, restlessness, spasms of the muscles, cramps of the chest, prostration, increasing coldness and blueness; wants to be uncovered and he is going into collapse.
The old Camphor, Cuprum and Veratrum still hold together for Asiatic cholera. In Camphor there is prostration, blueness, coldness and yet he wants to be uncovered and the body is cold and dry.
The other two remedies have all there is in cholera, but in Cuprum there is not so much coldness, more cramping, more convulsive tendency and not so much prostration.
The more cramping there is the more it is Cuprum. The more copious the discharge from the bowels and the more profuse the vomiting and sweat, the more we would think of Veratrum. Cold and dry: Camphor. Cold and copious discharge Veratrum.
After taking cold there is cutting, with involuntary discharge of dark brown faeces like coffee grounds. Tenesmus. At times the cholera patient, with the coldness and blueness, is retching and straining to vomit and suffering with horrible tenesmus to get rid of a little stool and has convulsions here and there. These bowels symptoms gradually increase until there is no ability to strain at stool, a paralytic condition. Rectum seems contracted and painful.
Urinary and sexual organs: There is suffering in the urinary and sexual organs. Burning urination. Strangury. Frequent urination.
Frequent desire, with difficulty. The same state arises in the bladder as in the rectum, and there is retention with horrible torture. The patient sits on the commode and strains to pass the urine, but there is a paralytic condition of the bladder. The urine is red, bloody, and comes by drops like Canth. Tenesmus of the neck of the bladder.
Camphor increases the sexual erethism to an unbearable degree. In some cases from large doses this is seen in the extreme, and in other cases the reverse takes place.
It has both sexual erethism and impotency in its provings. I once knew a French woman who had an insane desire to keep her boys always at home with her, and she thought she could accomplish this if she could only keep them away from the girls; and to destroy their sexual desire she kept a bag of camphor under their pillows. All of them were made impotent. But in some provers it establishes sexual erethism. It has this like Canth.
Nose: Camphor produces a coryza, with a profuse discharge from the nose and from the air passages, from the nose to the bronchi. Bronchitis of children and old people. Old withered up people take cold at every exposure to weather and become cold and chilly.
Ant. crud., Am. carb. and Camph. are wonderful remedies in octogenarians. Every cold seems threatening. Old people don't come down with cold the same as young people; they are prostrated, sinking, have rattling in the chest and the family think it is the death rattle and that it is grandpa’s last spell.
These three remedies fit the case, they are like the advanced stage of pneumonia. Ant. t., Ant. c., Am. c. and Camph. cover these cases in which the hot stage is omitted.
Camph. has very little heat; it has the sensation of heat; but not a marked hot stage. There are other symptoms in this medicine such as you will find in old people.
Jerking of the muscles, trembling and jerking. Spasmodic conditions with trembling. Trembling of the tongue.
The general constitutional state of a Camphor patient is coldness and extreme sensitiveness to cold. In acute inflammatory conditions he is cold and wants the covers off.
In acute complaints there is violent thirst, in chronic complaints thirstlessness. It is the same in Arsenic, in the acute thirsty, but in the chronic thirstless.
In Camphor an important thing to recall in the acute is that during the heat and when the pains are on he wants to be covered up. The coldness is relieved by cold, he wants more cold.

Cantharis
The most important feature of this medicine is the inflammatory condition, and the most important characteristic in the inflammation is the rapidity with which it develops into a gangrenous state. inflammation conditions usually follow a definite course for days, but when this medicine is put upon a part or taken internally the inflammatory state terminates in death of the part with great rapidity.
When taken internally it proceeds almost immediately to attack the urinary tract and establish a uraemic state which brings about the mental symptoms; the local inflammatory condition comes on with great rapidity, and this brings the patient down violently sick in a great hurry.
From strong doses in the poisonous effect we get startling and alarming symptoms; the whole economy is in disorder; grievous symptoms commonly of the urinary tract. The parts become gangrenous at an early stage.
Mind: The mental symptoms are striking. Among those that are guiding are sudden loss of consciousness with red face. Suddenly goes into stupor. Confusion of mind. Overwhelmed with strange ideas. Thoughts run riot, and go whatever way they will, as if possessed by outside influence.
Head hot, frenzy, delirium, with great excitement and rage, paroxysms renewed by dazzling or bright objects, by touching the larynx or by trying to drink water as in rabies.
Fear and confusion of ideas. The mind often runs towards subjects that the inflamed parts would suggest.
Bladder and genitals: The bladder and genitals are inflamed and the excitement and congestion of the parts often arouse the sexual instinct, so that there are sexual thoughts and sexual frenzy. Violent amorous frenzy, an excitement such as accompanies inflammation attended with thoughts that correspond. The sexual instinct has gone mad, the erections in the male are painful and violent.
The penis is inflamed and sore and it would be painful to have coitus, yet there is this frenzy. Insolence. Blasphemy. Restlessness ending in rage. Restlessness causing him to move constantly, a rage and delirium intermingled with amorous frenzy.
This kind of mental conduct in Cantharis is similar to what will take place in Hyos., Phos., and Secale; a violent delirious state intermingled with sexual ideas and talk. In some instances he deliriously sings lewd songs and prattles on the subject of human genitals, urine and feces, a wild raving on subjects not talked about in health except among the depraved.
But in disease, chaste and modest persons, virgins, will speak so that it is surprising where they have picked up such language. in such cases it is well to exclude everybody from the room except the nurse and doctor. I have seen a dear old mother weep and wring her hands and say:
"Where did my daughter learn such language?" The daughter is not to blame.
It is simply a condition of the urinary tract or the menstrual function, brought on from cold or exposure, or through the mother's neglect to tell her daughter what she should know in regard, to her menstrual function, and how there is inflammation of the ovaries or uterus, or outside parts, and the urine burns and causes an inflammatory condition of the outer parts, or the urine is retained and there is frenzy. Such in Cantharis.
Violent, bursting, lancinating headaches as if stabbed with a knife an inflammatory condition that takes hold of the mind violently.
Running all through the remedy there is burning. In the head burning, throbbing and stabbing. Unconsciousness and delirium in the mental state. Burning in the side of the head. Stitches in the side of the head and occiput. Lancinating pains deep in the brain. Hair falls out.
It is seldom indicated in eye troubles alone, except such as come with head and mind symptoms.
Erysipelas of the face with large blisters. Burning in the eyes and the whole atmosphere looks yellow. Burning and smarting in the eyes.
Erysipelas of the eyes, with gangrenous tendency. Eyes hot, scalding tears. Erysipelas of the face, dorsum of the nose, involving the lids.
Rhus is more commonly. used in this condition, but when it is violent Canth. will often be indicated and preferable to Rhus, Rhus has the blisters and the burning, but in Canth. between your two visits the erysipelas has grown black, it is dusky, a rapid change has taken place, and it looks as if gangrene would set in.
Burning in the erysipelatous area and the skin around burns from the touch. In Rhus this is not so. In Cantharis the little blisters even if touched burn like fire.
Eruptions burn when touched, ever so lightly, i.e., those eruptions such as the remedy could produce.
This patient enters into a state of prostration, is pallid, has Hippocratic countenance and dies. It corresponds to the lowest forms of disease, even gangrene and violent inflammation of the bowels, bladder, brain, spine and lungs; sinking and hippocratic countenance.
Inflammation of the lungs, gangrenous type, prostration and the lung that is affected burns like fire, and immediately he expectorates cadaverous smelling expectoration, thin, bloody, watery; it has come on in an astonishingly rapid manner, and ina little while he will die; the nose is contracted, there is the hippocratic countenance, and the urine is suppressed.
I remember one patient who had just come out of a prolonged drunk. I left the patient in the evening in just such, a state as I have described.
He was drooling a bloody saliva from his mouth and be was dying. He had had this condition come on in one night from being nearly frozen in a drunk.
It would be Cantharis or death before morning, but by morning he was expectorating a rusty sputum and went on to good recovery.
Arsenic has the burning in the lungs and he spits up black sputum, pneumonia signs are present, with the restlessness and anxiety, and other symptoms of Arsenic, and Arsenic will stop it at once. These violent remedies are needed in those cases that will die.
Burning in the throat. Great thirst, with burning in the throat and stomach. Thirst, with aversion to all fluids, that is, the craving of the mouth and throat are antagonized by the mental state. Thirst in the throat and an aversion to water in the mind. Violent, burning in the stomach, pylorus, abdomen.
The abdomen is swollen and tympanitic; lancinating pains cutting and stabbing. Wherever there is a rapid inflammation in the bowels there is diarrhoea of bloody mucus or serum, watery, bloody fluids from the bowels and stomach.
The same watery bloody fluid from the eyes. And wherever this watery fluid comes in contact with the skin it burns and excoriates. Bloody urine.
Desire for stool while urinating. The patient will sit on the commode with violent tenesmus to pass urine and stool, feels that if he could only pass a few more drops of urine or a little more bloody stool he would get relief, but no relief comes. All the parts are inflamed and on fire. Tenesmus and urging not only when the bladder is empty, but often when the bladder is full.
Retention of urine. Passes none or only a drop or two. Violent tenesmus of the bladder. Cutting pains with tenesmus, lancinating, stabbing like knives, in neck of bladder.
Pains shoot off in different directions. Violent pains with frequent urging. Constant tenesmus. An anxious state and frenzy come on; most violent suffering and be has urging to pass urine and stool with sexual erethism tantalizing in the extreme.
The whole urinary organs and genitalia are in a state of inflammation and gangrene. Burning when urinating. This bloody urine burns like fire in the bladder and about the genitals. Retention or suppression of urine.
It is rare that one suffering from gonorrhea has this violent inflammation, with burning and tenesmus of the bladder and rectum, but in such a case this remedy is indicated. The intensity and rapidity are the features of this remedy. It brings on pain and excitement found in no other remedy. Next to it comes Merc. cor.
In the female there is oversensitiveness of all parts. Inflammation of the ovaries and uterus. Burning in the vagina. Membranous dysmenorrhoea. Menses too early, profuse, black.
Puerperal convulsions. Retained placenta. Burning pains. When there have been no expulsive pains present to expel the afterbirth, with the symptoms running all through this remedy, after it has been given, normal contractions of the uterus have come on with expulsion of the membranes.
Violent lancinating pains through the kidneys and back. Pains in the loins and abdomen. Pain on urinating so that he moaned and screamed on passing a drop.
Capsicum
Most of the substances that are used on the table as seasoning in foods will in the course of a generation or two be very useful medicines because people poison themselves with these substances, tea, coffee, pepper, and these poisonous effects in the parents cause in the children a predisposition to disease, which is similar to the disease produced by these substances.
In the fat, flabby, red-raced children of beer drinkers and pepper eaters, with poor reaction, a relaxed and flabby constitution, red face and varicose condition, those that have been over stimulated, children of over stimulated men, we find the sphere of Capsicum very often.
Mind: In those constitutions in which the face looks rosy, but it is cold or not warm, and upon close examination the face is seen to be studded with a fine system of capillaries. Plump and round, with no endurance, a false plethora like Cal.
The end of the nose is red, the cheeks are red, redness over the cheeks, red eyes, easily relaxed individuals. These constitutions react slowly after diseases and do not respond to remedies, a sluggish state, a tired, lazy constitution.
In school girls who cannot study or work, who get home-sick and want to go home. In gouty constitutions, with cracking of the joints and gouty deposits in the joints, stiff joints, clumsy, weak, give out soon. There is
sluggishness of the whole economy. They are chilly patients, are sensitive to air, and what to be ina warm room. Even in the ordinary weather the open air causes chilliness. They are sensitive to cold and to bathing.
In the mental state there is no more striking thing than this symptom: homesickness. A sickness like homesickness runs through the remedy and is accompanied by red cheeks and sleeplessness, hot feeling in the fauces, fearfulness. They are oversensitive to impressions, are always looking for an offence or slight; always suspicious and looking for an insult.
Obstinate to the extreme; it is a devilishness. Even if she wants a certain thing she will oppose it if is proposed by some one else. After emotions red cheeks, yet with the red cheeks lack of heat, even with increased temperature; or one cheek pale and the other red, or the cheeks alternate red and pale. Children are clumsy and awkward.
The Capsicum mind is almost overwhelmed by persistent thoughts of suicide. He does not want to kill himself, he resists the thoughts, and yet they persist, and he is tormented by these thoughts.
There are persistent thoughts in many remedies, and it is necessary to distinguish between impulses and desires.
If he desires to have a rope or a knife to commit suicide, that is altogether different from an impulse to commit suicide.
An impulse is sometimes overwhelming and overbalances the mind, and he commits suicide. You should always find out from a patient whether he loathes life and wants to die, or if he has impulses which he wishes to put aside. Some persons lie awake at night and long for death, and there is no reason for it. That is a state of the will, insanity of the will.
In another patient the thoughts jump into his mind and he cannot put them aside, and the thoughts are tormenting. The distinguishing feature of the remedy is often found by differentiating between the two. Desires are of the will; impulses come into the thoughts.
Head: Headaches as if the skull would split when moving the head, when walking or coughing. Feeling as if the head would fly to pieces; holds the head with the hand. Feeling as if the head were large, aggravated by coughing and stepping, ameliorated by lying with the head high.
Bursting pain and throbbing. Headache with pulsation in the forehead and temples. Headache as if the brain would be pressed through the forehead. On stooping, feeling as if the brain would be pressed out, as if the red eyes would be pressed out on stooping.
The senses are disturbed and are overacute; oversensitiveness to noise, smells, taste and touch, to impressions, to insults. The patient is excited.
Ears: Pains in the ears; itching pain; aching, pressing pain with cough, as if an abscess would burst. It has a peculiar action on the bones of the internal ear and mastoid process. Abscesses round about and below the car and caries; petrous portion of temporal bone necrosed. It has been a frequently indicated remedy in mastoid abscess.
Nose: Old catarrhs. The patient takes cold in the nose and throat and this is followed by a collection of mucus. Very often in stupid patients it is difficult to get symptoms, and you must depend on what you see, the character of the discharge and a few other things, and you will find that some of these cases will be
cured and all the other symptoms will go away; but in some of these old catarrhs no reaction seems to come after the most carefully chosen remedies, and all at once the doctor observes that the patient has a red face and it is cold and the end of the nose is red and cold, and the patient is fat and flabby and yet has not much endurance, never could learn at school, and if she exerts breaks out into a sweat and freezes in the cold air.
He has a key to the patient and examines the patient by the key, that is, by the drug, a mad practice and never to be resorted to except as a dernier resort and in stupid patients. When he gives Capsicum to that patient it arouses her, it may not cure; but after it the Silicea or Kali bich. or other remedy which was perhaps given before and did not act takes hold and cures.
In the text it says, "Nose red and hot."
The skin all over is red and burning, a capillary congestion.
Face: The cheeks are red and hot, and this alternates with paleness. Red dots on the face. Pains in the face like bone pains, from external touch. Pains are worse from touch. Pain in the zygoma, or the zygoma is sensitive. Sensitive to pressure over the mastoid. Swelling in the region of the mastoid.
Taste foul like putrid water. When coughing the air from the lungs causes a pungent offensive taste in the mouth. A hot pungent air comes up from the throat, tasting foul when coughing.
On the tongue and lips, flat, sensitive, spreading ulcers with lardaceous base. The mucous membrane of the lips and various parts of the body if pinched up with the fingers remain in the raised position, showing a sluggish circulation.
This is the flabbiness of Capsicum. It wrinkles on pressure. It is a feeble circulation. The parts you touch are loose and flabby, red, fat and cold. That child will not react well if it has measles, until it gets Capsicum.
The skin is moist and cold, and there is a fine measly condition of the skin due to capillary congestion. If the child is old enough, it will complain of feeling cold. There is slow reaction after eruptive diseases, after glandular diseases, after bowel complaints. The child was fat and flabby, but now does not take on flesh.
He takes cold in the throat and nose, and the throat looks as if it would bleed, it is so red, a fine rash-like appearance - it is puffed, discolored, purple, mottled, flabby and spongy-looking; dark red. Burning soreness with ulceration in the fauces. Uvula elongated. Stitching in throat. Enlarged tonsils, inflamed, large and spongy.
The throat remains sore a long time after a cold or sore throat. Burning, pressing pain in the throat, the throat dark red; relaxed sore throat; pain on swallowing, dysphagia. Throat sluggish for weeks, a do-nothing state, does not get very bad, but gets no better, a lack of reaction.
When the chill begins there is thirst. Thirst after every dysenteric stool, a sudden carving for ice-cold water, which causes chilliness. Craving for water before the chill and when taken it hastens the chill; it feels cold in the stomach.
He desires something warm, something stimulating, craves pungent things. This is seen in whisky drinkers; they crave pepper, and the pepper, on the other hand, turns round and craves whisky. These diffusable stimulants crave some stimulating thing, crave support. Dipsomania.
Let me give you a hint in Arsenic. In dipsomania the sinners who have been drinking a great many drinks in a day sometimes get to that state in which they must get up during the night for a drink or they will not be able to get up in the morning.
In the morning the first three or four drinks will be thrown up, but the next one will stay down; they must take a number until one sticks. They have got to that state in which they must keep on taking it. If they sleep too long the first few drinks will come up, and so they must get up in the night or the whisky will not stay down in the morning until they have taken a number of drinks.
You will see this in lawyers who do a great amount of work on stimulants. Nux, Ars., and Caps. will do something for them if they will co-operate with you. I remember saying to one old toper, who had kept up altogether on champagne, that he would have to stop it. He whined,
"I don't think it is worth while.”
If he could not get his champagne he didn't think life worth living. if these people want to get benefit they must co-operate.
Abdomen: Dysentery. After stool, tenesmus and thirst, and drinking causes shuddering. Smarting and burning in anus and rectum. Violent tenesmus in rectum, and bladder at the same time. Haemorrhoids; protruding, smarting, burning; smarting like pepper; they sting and burn as if pepper had been sprinkled on them.
Tenesmus of the bladder; strangury. Burning, biting pain after urination, in old cases of gonorrhoea, in which there no reaction.
The discharge is creamy. You take a picture, of his face, you notice the plethora, but also that he has no endurance, plump, flabby, sensitive to cold, red face. He does not react after cold. He has the, last drop ora creamy discharge with burning on urination.
Capsicum will sometimes stop it suddenly. Coldness of scrotum. Prepuce swollen, oedematous. Pain in the prostate gland after gonorrhoea.
Coldness of the affected part. Coldness in patches. Coldness of the whole body.
It is useful in perplexing and troublesome chronic hoarseness. He had had a cold and remedies for the acute condition have been given, perhaps two or three remedies, Acon., Bry., Hep., Phos., but all at once you wake up to the fact of his chronic constitutional state of hoarseness. He is rotund, chilly, red faced, and the hoarseness disappears under Capsicum.
It is the same with the cough. After making several blunders you wake up and see it is a Capsicum case and
that you have never yet gotten at the root of the trouble. This shows the importance of getting at the things general first. If there is much acute suffering of course you must give an acute remedy, but if the patient has delayed recovery and convalescence is slow the next remedy should be the remedy for the patient.
Sometimes it is Sulph., Phos., Lyc., and sometimes it is Caps. If the patient has a good constitutional state he will get over the told on -the acute remedy, but the old gouty, rheumatic, flabby patients need a constitutional remedy.
Cough in sudden paroxysms convulsing the whole body. Cries, after the cough from the headache. Stitches in the suffering part with the cough. Every cough jars the affected joint. The constitutional state comes first and the particulars must agree i. e., prescribe according to the totality.
Carbo Animalis
Carbo animalis is one of the deep-acting, long-acting medicines. Suitable in complaints that come on insidiously, that develop slowly, that become chronic and often malignant in character.
Complaints in anaemic, broken down constitutions. Vascular conditions. The Carbons affect the veins more or less, relaxing, paralyzing. This one has its own peculiar feature of infiltrating little veins. just as sure, as an organ in the Carbo animalis patient becomes congested it becomes hard and purple from infiltration, and has a tendency to remain so.
Glands and veins: In an inflammation of a gland the veins become weak, and infiltrated, the gland itself becomes hard and sore, the tissues around it indurate, and the skin over it becomes purple. The glands of the throat and axilla grow purple and indurated with no tendency to soften.
Some of these medicines, after infiltrating a gland, will hurry up the inflammatory action, produce sloughing, rapid breaking down, with pus-like Hepar, Mercurius and Sulphur.
But this medicine paralyzes and infiltrates the little veins in the inflamed part, and there seems to be no tendency to suppuration.
We see that the economy. of this patient is in a sluggish state there are no rapid changes; but everything is slowed down. Even the inflammatory process is a passive one. Very often a slow quasi-erysipelatous inflammation comes on, the part becomes purple and will pit upon pressure. just think what a contrast this to Belladonna.
Belladonna will inflame all the glands, they will swell, become hot and so, sensitive that they can hardly be touched; at first bright red, then purple, with a tendency to resolution if let alone. But the Carbo animalis inflammation comes on slowly, its progress is slow, and there is no tendency to repair.
Enlargement of veins here and there over the body, varicose veins. There is intense burning in the part inflamed. which is indurated and purple. The glands of the throat burn.
Sluggish buboes in old broken down constitutions, in early stages of syphilis, inflame, become enlarged, purple, hard and burn. Lumps in the mammary glands. A purple lump the size of a hen's egg will form in the mammary gland.
It does not go on to suppuration, as you would expect it to, it just stays there. It does not enlarge much, but it is hard.
The woman has so much burning in the vagina that she persuades the physician to make a more careful examination than he has done. He will probably find the whole cervix inflamed, purple and somewhat, enlarged. She says it burns like coals of fire.
Carbo animalis eventually produces ulceration of the tissues in various parts, especially in glands.
After a while-but not early in the case - an ulcer forms, and perhaps after ulcerating for a time it comes toa standstill; it has become a sluggish ulcer. Indurated ulcers.
Ulcers and cancer: A bubo breaks down and forms an ulcer. All at once it stops suppurating and around about the tissues become hard and purple. The laudable discharge ceases, a bloody, ichorous discharge takes its place, and, the surrounding parts burn.
Now in ulcers and fistulous openings, where the walls become hard and burn, and the discharge becomes acrid, Carbo animalis is frequently the remedy.
It is not surprising that this remedy has been one of the most suitable for old, stubborn cancerous affections; for cancerous ulcers. They all burn, they are all surrounded by infiltrated, hardened, dark- colored tissue, and they all ooze an acrid ichorous fluid.
It has cured these troubles in old feeble constitutions with night-sweats and much bleeding. It has relieved in incurable cases, and has apparently removed the cancerous condition for years, even though it comes back afterward and kills. This remedy is often a great palliative for the pains that occur in cancer, the indurations and the stinging, burning pains.
Of course we do not want to teach, nor do we wish to have you infer, that a patient with a well-advanced cancerous affection, such as scirrhus, may be restored to perfect health and the cancerous affection removed. We may comfort that patient, and restore order at least temporarily, so that there is freedom from suffering in these malignant affections.
Most patients that have cancer are really in such a state of disorder that only a temporary cessation of “hostilities” can be expected; and anyone who goes around boasting of the cancer cases he has cured ought to be regarded with suspicion.
Do not dwell upon the cancer, for it is not the cancer but the patient that you are treating. It is the patient that is sick, and whenever a patient is sick enough to have a cancer his state of order is too much disturbed to be cured.
The proving of Carbo animalis presents the appearance of a broken down constitution. it brought out in the provers just such symptoms as occur in old, feeble constitutions with poor repair and lack of reaction.
Hence the medicine has been a great palliative for patients suffering from malignant infiltrations and indurations; suspicious indurations round about and under the bases of ulcers; suspicious indurations in glands.
A gland becomes inflamed, hard and remains so. Carbo animalis stands at the head of the list of remedies that have that condition.
All through the remedy there is hypertrophy. Tissues pile up here and there into hard nodules; tissues pile up in glands and in organs. The economy has lost its balance, and the result is a disorderly distribution of material. Great prostration, want of energy, associated with palpitation, anxiety and disorders of the pulse.
Weak pulse, rapid pulse, irregular pulse. Beating in blood vessels. There is turmoil in the economy, sometimes described as heat. A rushing of heat as though the body was full of steam.
Awful sensation through the chest and in the head, like some great earthquake taking place. These are due to abnormal conditions of the venous side of the heart.
Women: Flushes of heat; pulsations here and there. Hemorrhages. And of course the woman is more likely to bleed than the man; hence we have menses too early, too long, too copious. Prostration with every menstrual flow.
The Carbo animalis woman sinks down at every menstrual period as if she would die. Such striking weakness is not at all accounted for by the quantity of the flow.
Chronic induration, with enlargement of the uterus, which gradually grows from year to year (Aur. m. n.). Induration of the cervix and the whole uterus.
Copious flow of the leucorrhoea. Offensive uterine discharges. Ulceration of the uterus, going gradually toward the malignant state. The menses are black and offensive. Finally this poor, feeble woman, who has been plodding along for years with this condition, goes into malignant ulceration of the cervix, which burns, bleeds constantly and oozes a foetid watery flow. The burning pains in the uterus extend down to the thighs.
Whenever this patient puts the child to the breast she has a sensation of emptiness in the stomach, sinking in the pit of the stomach, and she must take the child away.
There are many uterine troubles, with burning, stinging, smarting, a yellow brown saddle over the bridge of the nose, something like the mottled yellow saddle of Sepia. All sorts of disordered conditions of the uterus.
Surging of blood upward to the head, rousing up in sleep, with horrible dreams. This poor mortal is suffering from troubles in the base of the brain, has tearing pains in the head, and especially of the occiput, growing increasingly sensitive to cold, increasingly chilly, increasingly waxy, until we have phthisis or cancer, with varicose veins and all the conditions that I have described.
Carbo Vegetabilis
We will take up the study of Vegetable Charcoal - Carbo veg.
It is a comparatively inert substance made medicinal and powerful, and converted into a great healing agent, by grinding it fine enough. By dividing it sufficiently, it becomes similar to the nature of sickness and cures folks.
The Old School use it in tablespoonful doses to correct acidity of the stomach. But it is a great monument to Hahnemann. It is quite inert in crude form and the true healing powers are not brought out until it is sufficiently potentized. It is one of those deep acting, long-acting antipsoric medicines. It enters deeply into the life, in its proving it develops symptoms that last a long time, and it cures conditions that are of long standing-those that come on slowly and insidiously.
Generalities: It affects the vascular system especially; more particularly the venous side of the economy, the heart, and the whole venous System.
Sluggishness is a good word to think of when examining the pathogenesis of Carbo veg.
Sluggishness, laziness, turgescence, these are words that will come into your mind frequently, because these, states occur so frequently in the symptomatology. Everything about the economy is sluggish, turgid, distended and swollen.
The hands are puffed; the veins are puffed; the body feels full and turgid; the head feels full, as if full of blood. The limbs feel dull, so that the patient wants to elevate the feet to let the blood run out. The veins are lazy, relaxed and paralyzed. Vaso-motor paralysis. The veins of the body are enlarged; the extremities have varicose veins.
Mind: The whole mental state, like the physical, is slow. The mental operations are slow. Slow to think; sluggish; stupid; lazy. Cannot whip himself into activity, or rouse a desire to do anything. Wants to lie down and doze.
The limbs are clumsy; they feel enlarged. The skin is dusky. The capillary circulation is engorged. The face is purple. Any little stimulating food or drink will bring a flush to that dusky face. When you see people gather round a table where wine is served you can pick out the Carbo veg. patients, because their faces will be flushed; in a little while it passes off and they get purple again dusky - almost a dirty duskiness. The skin is lazy; sluggish.
Running through the remedy there is burning. Burning in the veins, burning in the capillaries, burning in the head, itching and burning of the skin. Burning in inflamed parts. Internal burning and external coldness.
Coldness, with feeble circulation, with feeble heart. Icy coldness. Hands and feet cold and dry, or cold and moist.
Knees cold; nose cold; ears cold; tongue cold. Coldness in the stomach with burning. Fainting. Covered all over with a cold sweat, as in collapse.
Collapse with cold breath, cold tongue, cold face. Looks like a cadaver. In all these conditions of coldness the patient wants to be fanned.
Bleeding runs all through the remedy. Oozing of blood from in flamed surfaces. Black bleeding from ulcers. Bleeding from the lungs; from the uterus; from the bladder. Vomiting of blood.
Passive haemorrhage. On account of the feeble circulation a capillary oozing will start up and continue. The remedy hardly ever has what may be called an active gushing flow, such as belongs to Belladonna, Ipecac, Aconite, Secale, and such remedies, where the flow comes with violence; but it is a passive capillary oozing.
The women suffer from this kind of bleeding; a little blood oozing all the time, so that the menstrual period is prolonged. Oozing of blood after confinement, that ought to be stopped immediately by contractions.
There are no contractions of the blood vessels; they are relaxed. Black venous oozing. After a surgical operation there is no contraction and retraction of the blood vessels. An injury to the skin bleeds easily. The arteries have all been tied and closed, but the little veins do not seem to have any contractility in their walls. An inflamed part may bleed. Feeble heart; relaxed veins.
Ulcers: Again, ulceration. If you have a case, such as I have described, with relaxation of the blood vessels and feebleness of the tissues, you need not be surprised if there is no repair, no tissue making.
So, when a part is injured, it will slough. If an ulcer is once established, it will not heal. The tissues are indolent. Hence we have indolent ulcers; body, ichorous, acrid, thin discharges from ulcers.
The skin ulcerates; the mucous membranes ulcerate. Ulcers in the mouth and in the throat. Ulceration everywhere because of that relaxed and feeble condition. Poor tissue making, or none at all,
"The blood stagnates in the capillaries," is the way it reads in the text.
You can see how easy it would be for these feeble parts to develop gangrene. Any little inflammation or congestion becomes black or purple and sloughs easily that is all that is necessary to make gangrene.
It is a wonderful remedy in septic conditions-blood poisoning, especially after surgical operations and after shock. It is a useful remedy in septic conditions; in scarlet fever; in any disease which takes on a sluggish form, with purplish and mottled appearance of the skin.
Sleep: In Carbo veg. the sleep is so full of anxiety that it may be said to be awful. On going to sleep there is anxiety, suffering, jerking, twitching, and be has the horrors. Everything is horrible. Horrible visions; sees ghosts.
A peculiar sluggish, death-like sleep, with visions. The Carbo veg. patient wakens in anxiety and covered with cold sweat. Exhaustion. Unrefreshed after sleep.
And thus the whole patient is prostrated by his sleep. So anxious that he does not want to go to sleep. Anxiety in the dark. Anxiety with dyspnoea as if he would suffocate. Anxiety so great that be can not lie down.
In Carbo veg. indifference is a very prominent symptom. Inability to perceive or to feel the impressions that circumstances ought to arouse.
His affections are practically blotted out, so that nothing that is told him seems to arouse or disturb him. "Heard everything without feeling pleasantly or unpleasantly, and without thinking about it."
Horrible things do not seem to affect him much; pleasant things do not affect him. He does not quite know whether he loves his wife and children or not.
This is a part of the sluggishness, the inability to think or meditate, all of which is due to the turgescence. Sluggishness of the veins. Head feels full; distended.
His mind is in confusion and he cannot think. He cannot bring himself to realize whether a thing be so or not, or whether he loves his family or not, or whether he hates his enemies or not. Benumbed stupid.
There is another state anxiety and nightly fear of ghosts anxiety as if possessed; anxiety on closing the eyes; anxiety lying down in the evening; anxiety again on waking. He is easily frightened. Starting and twitching on going too sleep.
Head: The headaches are mostly occipital. His whole head is turgid, full, distended. He feels as if the scalp was too tight. Everything is bound up in the head. Awful occipital headaches. Cannot move, cannot turn over, cannot lie on the side, cannot be jarred, because it, seems as if the head would burst, as if something was grasping the occiput.
Dull headache in the occiput. Violent pressive pain in the lower portion of the occiput. Head feels heavy. When the pain is in the occiput the head feels drawn back to the pillow, or as if it could not be lifted from the pillow.
Like Opium; he cannot lift the head from the pillow. Painful throbbing in the head during inspiration. The Carbo veg. patient takes short breaths, quietly, keeping just as still as possible, until finally he is compelled to take a deep breath, and it comes out with a sharp moan.
Headache as from contraction of the scalp. Painful stitches through the whole head when coughing; the whole head burns. Intense heat of the head; burning pain. Rush of the blood to the head followed by nose- bleed.
Congestion to the head with spasmodic constriction, nausea, and pressure over the eyes. A feeling as of an oncoming coryza from an overheated room. Many of these headaches come on from taking cold, from coryza, from slacking up of an old catarrh.
The Carbo veg. patient suffers from chronic catarrh. He is at his best when he has a free discharge from the nose, but if he takes cold and the discharge stops congestion to the head comes. He cannot stand suppression of discharges.
Headaches come on every time he takes cold; from cold damp weather; from going into a cold damp place and becoming chilled. Awful occipital headache, or headache over the eyes, or headache involving the whole head, with pounding like hammers.
These states are like Kali bichromicum, Kali iodatum and Sepia. Many of these headaches are due to stopped catarrhal conditions.
The hair falls out by the handful. Eruptions come out upon the head. School girls and boys, too, who are sluggish, slow to learn, and suffer from night terrors; they will not sleep alone, or go into a dark room without someone with them.
They have headaches, worse from pressure of the hat. A long time after taking off the hat they still feel the pressure. Sweat, cold sweat; particularly sweat of the head and of the forehead.
The Carbo veg. patient breaks out into a copious sweat, appearing first on the forehead, and the sweat is cold. The forehead feels cold to the hand, and any wind blowing upon it will produce pain; he wants it covered up. Head sensitive to cold.
If he becomes overheated and like head perspires, and then a draft strikes that sweating head, his catarrh will stop at once and headaches will come on. His knees and hands and feet get cold, and he sweats without relief.
Eyes: The eye symptoms are troublesome, and they often occur along with the headache. Burning pain in the eyes. The eyes become lustreless, deep-set, and the pupils do not react to light. He feels sluggish mentally, and does not want to think.
He wants to sit or lie around, for every exertion gives him a headache. Whenever this state is present the eyes show it. You know he is sick because the bright, sparkling look has gone out of his eyes. If he could only get somewhere by himself and lie down-provided it was not dark, he would be comfortable.
He wants to be let alone; he is tired; his day's work wears him out. He comes home with a purple face, lustreless eyes, sunken countenance, tired head and mind. Any mental exertion causes fatigue. Weight in the head, distress and fullness in the head, with cold extremities.
The blood mounts upward. Hemorrhages from the eyes; burning, itching and pressing in the eyes. The eyes become weak from overwork or from fine work.
Ears: Carbo veg. is one of the medicines for discharges from the ears. Offensive, watery, ichorous, acrid and excoriating discharges, especially those dating back to malaria, measles or scarlet fever, particularly to scarlet fever.
A sluggish condition of the venous system. The veins seem to be most affected in all old complaints, especially whenever a patient says of himself, or a mother says of her child, that he has never been quite well since an attack of malarial fever.
The daughter has never been quite well since she had the measles, or typhoid fever, or scarlet fever; Carbo veg. is one of the medicines to be thought of when symptoms are in confusion, and the patient has been so much doctored that there is no congruity left in the symptoms.
Old ear discharges, or old headaches, when all the symptoms have been suppressed. It is then Carbo veg. often becomes one of the routine remedies to bring symptoms into order and to establish a more wholesome discharge from that ear. it brings about reaction, establishes a better circulation and partially cures the case, after which a better remedy may be selected.
Inflammation of the parotid glands, or mumps. When mumps change their abode, from being chilled, and go in the girl to the mammary glands, and in the boy to the testes, Carbo veg. is one of the medicines to restore order; very often it will bring the trouble back to its original place, and conduct it on through in safety.
Pains in the ear. Passive, badly-smelling discharges from the ear. Loss of hearing. Ulceration of the internal ear. Something heavy seems to lie before the ears; they seem stopped; the hearing is diminished, especially in those cases that date back to some old trouble.
Nose: The Carbo veg. patient is always suffering from coryza. He goes into a warm room, and, thinking he is going out in a minute, he keeps his overcoat on.
Pretty soon he begins to get heated up, but he thinks he will go in a minute and he does not take off his coat. A procedure like that is sure to bring on a coryza. It will commence in the nose, with watery discharge, and he will sneeze, day and night.
He suffers from the heat and is chilled by the cold; every draft chills him; and a warm room makes him sweat, and thus he suffers from both. He can find no comfortable place, and he goes on sneezing and blowing his nose.
Perhaps he has bleeding from the nose. At night he is purplish. The coryza extends into the throat and brings on rawness and dryness in the mouth and throat. A copious watery discharge, filling the posterior nares and the throat.
Larynx and chest: Then he begins to get hoarse, and in the evening he has a hoarse voice, with rawness in the larynx and throat. Rawness in the larynx on coughing; soreness to the touch. The more he coughs the worse the rawness becomes.
This condition extends into the chest. Secretion of much thin mucus, finally becoming thick yellowish- green, and bad-tasting. Such is the coryza. Now, with it there comes a stomach disturbance that is commonly associated with Carbo veg. complaints.
Great distension of the abdomen with gas. With this coryza he has belching, and sour, disordered stomach. Every time he disorders his stomach he is likely to get a coryza. Every time he goes into an overheated room he is likely to get a coryza, with sneezing, chest complaints, and catarrh.
This catarrhal state in the nose is only a fair example of what may occur anywhere where there is a mucous membrane. Catarrhal conditions with a flow of watery mucus and bleeding. Carbo veg. has catarrhs of the throat, nose, eyes, chest, and vagina.
Old catarrhal conditions of the bladder; catarrh of the bowels and stomach. It is pre-eminently a catarrhal remedy.
The woman feels best when she has more or less of a leucorrhea, it seems a sort of protection. These discharges that we meet every day are dried up and controlled by local treatments, by washes, and by local applications of every kind, and the patient put into the hands of the undertaker, or made a miserable wreck.
If these catarrhal patients are not healed from within out, the discharges had better be allowed to go on. While these discharges exist the patient is comfortable. It is quite common for the Carbo veg. patient to be feverish with the coryza, but with many other complaints he is cold; cold limbs; cold face; cold body; cold skin; cold sweat.
It is not so common for the earlier stages of the coryza, and the catarrhal conditions to have these cold symptoms. He is feverish in the evening and at night. But after he passes into the second stake, when the, mucus is more copious, then come the cold knees, cold nose, cold feet, and cold sweat.
Face: The face of Carbo veg. is a great study. In the countenance and in the expression we see much that is general.
The patient shows his general state in his expression, especially in the eyes. He tells you how sick he is; he tells you the threatening points.
In Carbo veg. there is great pallor and coldness, with lips pinched and nose pointed and drawn in. Lips puckered, blue, livid, sickly, deathly. Face cold, pale, and covered with sweat.
As the tongue is protruded for examination it is pale and cold, and the breath is cold, yet he wants to be fanned. This is true whether it be cholera, diarrhea, exhaustive sweats, or complaints after fevers.
Sometimes, after a coryza has run its course and ended in the chest, there is great dyspnea, copious expectoration, exhaustive sweat, great coldness and the patient must be fanned.
Cough followed by dyspnea, exhaustion, profuse sweats, with choking and rawness and he wants to be fanned. Cold face; pinched face. So the sufferings are expressed in the face. The pains and aches, and anxiety and sorrow are all expressed in the face.
The study of the face is a delightful and profitable one. The study of the faces of remedies is very profitable. It is profitable to study the faces of healthy people that you may be able to judge their intentions from their facial expressions. A man shows his business of life in his face; he shows his method of thinking, his hatreds, his longings, and his loves.
How easy it is to pick out a man who has never loved to do anything but to eat: the Epicurean face. How easy it is to pick out a man who has never loved anything but money: the miserly face. You can see the love in many of the professional faces; you can single out the student's face.
These are only manifestations of the love of the life which they live. Some manifest hatred; hatred of the life in which they have been forced to live; hatred of mankind; hatred of life. In those who have been disappointed in everything they have undertaken to do we see hatred stamped upon the face.
We see these things in remedies just as we see them in people. The study of the face is a most delightful one. A busy, thoughtful and observing physician has a head full of things that he can never tell: things he knows about the face.
So the face expresses the remedy. In Carbo veg. the face flushes to the roots of the hair after a little wine. This is a strong characteristic. All over the body the skin will become flushed. Sometimes a flush appears in islands, which grow together and become one solid flush, creeping up into the hair.
So great is the action of this remedy upon the capillary circulation that sometimes a tablespoonful of wine is sufficient to cause this flushing of the skin.
Gums: The old books talk about "scorbutic gums;" now we call it Rigg's disease: a separation of the gums from the teeth. Bleeding of the gums; sensitiveness of the gums. Separation of the gums from the teeth.
The teeth get loose. We hear about "the teeth rattling in his mouth."
The Carbons produce just such a state, a settling away and absorbing of the gums. They get spongy and bleed easily, and hence looseness of the teeth with bleeding of the gums, which are very sensitive.
Teeth decay rapidly. Bleeding of the gums when cleaning the teeth. Teeth and gum affections from abuse of Mercury, Teeth feel too long and are sore. Drawing and tearing in the teeth. Tearing in the teeth from hot, cold or salt food; pain from both heat and cold. This is in keeping with the general venous condition of the whole system.
Sensitiveness of the tongue. Inflammation of the tongue. In certain low forms of fever, like typhus and typhoid fevers, the gums turn black; that is, they throw out a blackish, bloody, offensive, putrid exudate. If disturbed or touched they bleed; and the tongue piles up that blackish exudate - that oozing of black blood from the veins.
This is present in putrid forms of fevers like the typhoid-in zymotic states. This remedy is rich in those zymotic symptoms, such as are described in common speech as "blood-poisoning."
Carbo veg. is a sheet-anchor in low types of typhoid; in scarlet fever where a typhoid condition is coming upon the case, and in the last stages of collapse; in cholera, and in yellow fever at the time of collapse, where there is coldness, cold sweat, great prostration, dyspnoea - wants to be fanned. Great prostration with cold tongue,
Mouth and throat: The mouth and throat are filled with little purple aphthous ulcers, which were little white spots to begin with, but they have grown purplish and now ooze black blood. These aphthous patches bleed easily, burn and sting. Blisters form. Smarting, dryness of the mouth with bleeding aphthous ulcers. These are common features of Carbo veg. in any of the mouth and throat conditions.
Tough mucus in the throat; bloody mucus in the throat. These little ulcers run together, spread and become one solid mass. A large surface will become ulcerated, denuded of its mucous membrane, and then it will bleed. Little black spots come upon it. Food cannot be swallowed because the throat is so sore. Generally the throat feels puffed.
The Cargo veg. patient has a longing for coffee, acids, sweet and salt things. Aversion to the most digestible things and the best of food. For instance, aversion to meat, and to milk which causes flatulence. Now, if I were going to manufacture a Carbo veg. constitution I would commence with his stomach.
If I wanted to produce these varicose veins and the weak venous side of the heart; this fullness and congestion, and flatulence, this disordered stomach and bowels, and head and mind troubles; sluggishness of the economy.
I would begin and stuff him. I would feed him with fats, with sweets, puddings, pies and sauce, and all such indigestible trash, and give him plenty of wine - then I would have the Carbo veg. patient.
Do we ever have any such people to treat? just as soon as they tell their story, you will know, enough about their lives to know that they are mince pie fiends; they have lived on it for years, and now they come saying,
"Oh, doctor, my stomach; just my stomach; if you will simply fix up my stomach."
But what are you going to do with him? He has made himself into a Carbo veg. patient for you, and it may be quite a while before you can bring him down to a sensible diet.
Now he must begin at the foot of the ladder. I only brought this up to show how a Carbo veg, patient is produced and what kind of a stomach he has, and what he has been living on. He has burning in the stomach, distension of the stomach, constant eructations, flatulence, passing offensive flatus.
In reality he is in a foetid condition, a putrid condition. His sweat is offensive. He has heartburn eructations, the stomach regurgitates the food that he takes.
Carbo veg. has much vomiting at the end of the chill. Vomiting and diarrhoea. Vomiting and blood; with the vomiting of blood the body is icy cold; breath cold, The pulse is thready and intermittent. Fainting; hippocratic face; oozing of thick black blood.
Vomiting of sour, bloody, bilious masses.
Stomach and food: There is an accumulation of flatus in the stomach, so that the stomach feels distended. All food taken into the stomach seems to turn into flatus; he is always belching and is slightly,
relieved for a while by belching. Carbo veg., has cramps in the bowels and stomach; burning pain; anxiety; distension.
All these symptoms are ameliorated by belching or passing flatus. Amelioration from belching seems quite a natural event; but when we study China, you will see that the patient appears to be aggravated from belching. The idea is that the patient gets relief from belching from eructation, but under Lycopodium and China it seems that no relief comes. They belch copiously and yet seem just as full of mind as ever, and sometimes even seem to be worse.
The Carbo veg. patient experiences a decided relief from eructation. This is a particular symptom, but it becomes almost general, and sometimes quite general. Headaches are relieved by belching; rheumatic pains are relieved by belching; sufferings and distensions of various kinds are relieved by eructations.
This abdominal fullness aggravates all the complaints of the body. The fullness, which is described as if in the veins, is sometimes in the tissues, under the skin, so that it will crepitate. This is a feature of Carbo veg., and, in rheumatic conditions, part of the swelling is sometimes of this character.
Food remains a long time in the stomach, becomes sour and putrid. It passes into the bowels and ferments further, finally passing off in the form of putrid flatus.
There is colic, burning pains, distension, fullness, constricting and cramping pains from this distension.
The patient complains of feeling as if the stomach were raw. This is described as a smarting, sometimes from taking food; sometimes from taking cold water. Carbo veg., has cured ulceration of the stomach. It is a deep-acting medicine, and is capable of curing all disordered conditions of the stomach; such as disorders from eating indigestible things, mince pie, too hearty food.
Liver: In Carbo veg. the liver, like all the other organs, takes on a state of torpidity and sluggishness. It becomes enlarged. The portal system is engorged, and hence hemorrhoids develop.
Pain and distension in the region of the liver; sensitiveness and burning in the liver, accompanied by a bloated condition of the stomach and bowels. A feeling of tension in the region of the liver; the part feels drawn, as if too tight.
There are pressing pains in the liver, and it is sensitive to touch.
Abdomen: Much that I have said regarding the flatulence and fullness of the stomach applies also to the abdomen. Carbo veg. may be indicated in low forms of fever, as in septic fever, when there is a marked tympanitic condition, with diarrhoea, bloody discharges, distension and flatulence.
Extremely putrid flatus escapes making the patient very offensive. A striking abdominal symptom of Carbo veg. is that the flatus collects here and there in the intestine as if it were in a lump incarcerated flatus; a constriction of the intestine will hold it in one place so that it feels like a lump or tumor, that finally disappears.
Colic here and there in the abdomen from flatus. There is burning in the abdomen. No matter what the trouble is, in Carbo veg. there is always burning. The part burns; it feels full; it becomes engorged and turgid with blood.
Diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera, when there is a bloody, watery stool. Cholera infantum; stool mixed with mucus; watery mucus mixed with blood.
The child sinks from exhaustion, with coldness, pallor and cold sweat. The nose, face and lips are pinched and hippocratic. With all diarrheic troubles the prostration will indicate Carbo veg. as much as, if not more than, the stool.
In the diarrhea of Carbo veg. all the stools, no matter what kind, are putrid, with putrid flatulence. The more thin, dark bloody mucus there is, the better is the remedy indicated. Itching, burning and raw ness of the anus and round about, are strong features of Carbo veg.
Soreness in all diarrheic conditions - soreness to pressure over the abdomen. Round about the anus, in children, there is excoriation. The parts are red, raw and bleeding, and they itch.
Itching of the anus in adults. Ulceration of the bowels. This tendency to ulceration of mucous membranes is in keeping with the character of the remedy. Whenever there are mucous membranes there may be ulceration. Aphthous appearance. Ulceration of Peyer's glands. The patient lies in bed and oozes involuntarily a thin bloody fluid, like bloody serum.
Bladder: Old chronic catarrhal conditions of the bladder, when the urine contains mucus, especially in old people, with cold face, cold extremities and cold sweat.
There is suppression of urine. In both the male and the female organs there is a weakness and relaxation. The male organs hang down. Relaxation of the genitalia; cold and sweating genitals. The fluids escape involuntarily.
Women: In the woman the relaxation is manifested by a dragging down sensation; dragging down of the uterus, as if the internal parts would escape. The uterus drags down so that she cannot stand on her feet. All the internal organs feel heavy and hang down.
Another strong feature of Carbo veg. is dark, oozing haemorrhage from the uterus. It is not so often a copious gushing hemorrhage, the remedy has that also - but it is an oozing. The menstrual flow will ooze from one period almost to another.
The blood is putrid and dark, even black, with small clots, and considerable serum escapes with it. it says in the text:
"Metrorrhagia from uterine agony."
Atony is a good name for the condition; lack of tone; relaxation; weakness of the tissue. Atony is everywhere present in the Carbo veg. constitution. The muscles are tired, the limbs are tired, the whole being is tired and relaxed.
This is in contradistinction to the gushing found in Belladonna, Ipecac, Secale and Hamamelis, where the blood escapes in great gushes, followed quite naturally by a contraction of the uterus, for there is more or less tonicity in connection with it.
In Carbo veg., either in connection with confinement or menstruation, or in an incidental haemorrhage, the uterus does not contract. Subinvolution from mere atony; no contraction; no tonicity; weakness and relaxation.
After menstruation, confinement and the various complaints that woman is subject to, there is a period of weakness that Carbo veg. often fits.
When there is a retained placenta, with scanty hemorrhage - just an oozing, with no tendency to a gush of blood - the physician remembers that throughout the whole pregnancy and confinement there has been sluggishness and slowness of pains, and he says:
"Why did I not think of Carbo veg. Before?"
The woman has needed Carbo veg. for a month. He administers a dose, and before he has time to think about it, the uterus will expel that placenta and fix up matters so nicely that he will not need the mechanical interference that might otherwise have been necessary.
Now-a-days we hear so much about this meddlesome midwifery, this curetting, and doing this and that and the other thing, that it makes a homeopathic physician disgusted, just as if those parts were not made by Nature, and could not take care of themselves; as if they must be swabbed out and syringed out.
These injections of bichlorides, etc., to keep the germs out of a woman are all nonsense. If a state of order is maintained there will be no germs.
A homoeopathic physician can manage hundreds of these cases, and have no trouble. If he sees clearly beforehand what remedy the woman needs there will be no bad cases; they will all take care of themselves.
Irregular contractions that bring on abnormal conditions are all avoided if the woman is turned into order before she goes into confinement. Carbo veg. is one of the medicines that prepares a woman well for confinement, that is, the symptoms calling for Carbo veg. are often present in such conditions. She is often run down, relaxed and tired. Pregnancy brings about a great many unusual conditions.
There is the nausea in pregnancy; the flatulence; the offensiveness; the weakness; the enlarged veins. They will tell you that the enlargement of the veins of the lower limbs is from pressure, but it is generally not from pressure, but from weakness of the veins themselves.
Suppression of milk; prostration or great debility from nursing. It is not natural for a woman in a healthy state to become prostrated when nursing her child. She becomes so because she is sick. She was in a state of debility before she began nursing, and the weakness should be corrected by an appropriate remedy.
Then she can make milk and feed her child without feeling the loss of it. Such is the state of order. Carbo veg. is a friend to the woman, and a friend to her offsprings. You will be astonished, after ten years of real homoeopathic practice, that you have so few deformed babies; that they have all grown up and prospered; that their little defects and deformities have been outgrown, and that they are more beautiful than most children, because they have been kept orderly.
The doctor watches and studies him, and feeds him a little medicine now and then, that the mother suspects is sugar, to keep on the good side of the baby. She need not know that it is medicine, or that anything is the matter with the baby.
So he watches the development of that little one, and grows him out of all his unhealthy tendencies. The children that grow up under the care of the homoeopathic physician will never have consumption, or Bright's disease; they are all turned into order, and they will die of old age, or be worn out properly by business cares; they will not rust out.
It is the duty of the physician to watch the little ones. To save them from their inheritances and their downward tendencies is the greatest work of his life. That is worth living for. When we see these tendencies cropping out in the little ones we should never intimate - that they are due to the father or mother.
It is only offensive and does no good. The physician's knowledge as to what he is doing is his own, and the greatest comfort be can get out of it is his own. He need never expect that anyone will appreciate what he has done, or what be has avoided.
The physician who desires praise and sympathy for what he has done generally has no conscience. The noble, upright, truthful physician works in the night he works in the dark, he works quietly; he is not seeking for praise.
He does this when called to the house, and when members of the family bring little ones to the office. In this manner children can be studied and their symptoms observed and enquired into.
Whenever the mother brings the child. expecting medicine, she may know that he is receiving medicine, but when she docs not ask for medicine let her suspect that Johnnie is getting sugar so the doctor can get on the good side of him. That is sufficient.
Voice and larynx: In Carbo veg. the voice manifests a great many symptoms. I described a part of them when going over the coryza. I explained how it began in the nose, and traveled to the throat, the larynx, and the chest.
Now many of the complaints of the larynx begin with a cold, in the nose, which finally locates permanently in the larynx and in that way we bring out the Carbo veg. cases.
It is only now and then that the Carbo veg. cold settles in the larynx first; it usually travels through the nose. Most remedies have a favorite place for beginning a cold. For instance, the majority of Phosphorus colds begin in the chest or larynx. Not so with Carbo veg.; its cold generally begins in the nose, with a coryza, and the larynx is simply one of the stopping places.
If the Carbo veg. cold goes down into the chest it may have its ending in the bronchial tubes or the lungs. There is a favorite place for it to settle, and it seems as if it were going to remain there. Weakness in the larynx from talking. Tired larynx of speakers and singers, and feeble, relaxed persons.
The hoarseness comes on in the evening. The larynx may be fairly well in the morning, but as soon as it becomes evening his voice becomes husky. In more serious forms he may be speechless in the morning, but hoarseness and huskiness in the evening are more characteristic. Huskiness and rawness in the evening. Rawness in the larynx when coughing. Some will say there is burning, some will say rawness. Rawness in the larynx and trachea when coughing.
A continual formation of mucus in the larynx, which he has to scrape and cough out. We see the same tendency to weak ness in the mucous membranes. No tendency to repair; no tendency to recover. He goes on from bad to worse, with a catarrhal condition of the larynx and trachea. Hoarseness and rawness from talking, worse afternoon and evening.
He is obliged to clear his throat so, many times in the evening that the larynx becomes raw and sore. Let me tell you another thing about the Materia Medica. Most of the provers were laymen, and hence there is some confusion of terms in the provings. This the physicians must see. Irritation in the throat from coughing nearly always means irritation in the larynx, though the prover said "throat."
Now here is an expression, "obliged to clear his throat so often in the evening that the larynx becomes raw and sore." Clearing the throat would not make the larynx sore.
Scraping the throat does not scrape the larynx; but he is obliged to clear his larynx so often that the part feels raw. Ulcerative pain, scraping and titillation in the larynx. Irritation in the larynx causing sneezing. Laryngeal phthisis. This catarrhal condition and lack of repair in the larynx goes on so long that tuberculosis begins.
Whooping cough: Carbo veg. is one of the greatest medicines we have in the beginning of whooping cough. Its cough has all the gagging, vomiting and redness of the face found in whooping cough. It is one of our best medicines when the case is confused; when the cough indicates no remedy or when it remains in a partially developed state.
A dose of Carbo veg. in such cases will improve matters very much, and minor cases of whooping cough may be wiped out in a few days. When the remedy does not cure permanently, it brings out more clearly the symptoms calling for another remedy. Most cases of whooping cough, in the care of a homoeopathic physician, will get well in a week or ten days under a carefully selected remedy.
When allowed to run, they continue a long time, gradually increasing for six weeks, and then declining according to the weather. If it is in the fall, the cough will sometimes keep up all winter; so whooping cough furnishes an opportunity for the homeopathic physician to demonstrate that there is something in Homoeopathy.
Respiration: The Carbo veg. patient suffers very much from difficulties of breathing. Suffocation; cannot lie down. A feeling of weakness in the chest, as if he could not get another breath. Sometimes it is due to cardiac weakness, and sometimes to stuffing up of the chest. The latter is most common. Sometimes the difficulty is asthmatic. The remedy cures asthma. We will see the patient propped up in a chair by an open window, or some members of the family may be fanning him as fast as possible.
The face is cold, the nose pinched, the extremities cold and he is as pale as death. Put the hand in front of the mouth, and the breath feels cold. The breath is offensive; putrid. The extremities are cold clear to the body; not only the hands, but the whole upper extremities; and not only the feet, but the limbs clear to the body, are cold. The body only feels warm; even the skin is cold.
Carbo veg. has a rattling cough with retching and vomiting. A morning cough, with much rattling in the chest; the chest fills with mucus, and on endeavoring to expectorate he coughs and gags, or coughs and vomits. At any time during the day a peculiar choking, gagging, retching cough may develop from the mucus in the chest. He cannot get it up; it is tough, purulent, yellow and thick.
Greatly reduced vitality; great relaxation; worn out persons, old people. Persons worn out from coughing or from prolonged exertion. Prostration. Catarrh of the chest, with copious expectoration. At times there will bea hard, dry hacking cough, but finally, after prolonged coughing, it commences to loosen and he throws up great quantities of mucus.
A dry, hacking cough, yet there is rattling in the chest, and the cough does not seem to do any good. He seems to cough and become exhausted, sweats and strangles. It seems as if he would suffocate with the cough.
Finally he succeeds in getting up some mucus, and the follows mouthful after mouthful of thick purulent expectoration. Frequent attacks of spasmodic cough in violent paroxysm lasting for many minutes, sometimes an hour.
Cold sweat, coldness and pinched appearance of the face. This increases as he goes into the paroxysm of coughing. His face looks haggard, so distressed does he become while in a paroxysm of coughing. This state is present in old phtisical cases, in the advanced stage, when they are incurable. Under such circumstances Carbo veg. furnishes an excellent palliative.
It seems to strengthen the muscles of the chest so that the patient can expectorate better. It mitigates the cough; the gagging and retching and dyspnoea are relieved, and he is temporarily improved. It is a wonderful palliative in many incurable conditions with dyspnoea and weakness of the chest. In Bright's Disease, in phthisis, and in cancerous affections Carbo veg. stops the violent symptoms and mitigates greatly.
This remedy is one to begin whooping cough with. It simplifies the case greatly, and sometimes cures it in a few days. The patient coughs until the chest is sore, as if he had been beaten all over the chest.
All night he has paroxysms of coughing. He sleeps into a paroxysm of, coughing, like Lachesis. He rouses up from sleep with coughing, gagging, sweating and suffocation. He will go two or three hours without a paroxysm, and then on comes one that will last an hour. He has two or three hard paroxysms of coughing during the night. He commences to fill up, he hears the rattling breathing and he knows that before long he will have a hard time of it.
This goes on and on, to the end of his life in asthmatic cases-what is called "humid asthma".
Real humid asthma comes on in persons who suffer from contractions of the small bronchial tubes, so that even at the best there are little whistlings in the chest. Every time such patients take cold their whistling increases.
They expectorate mucus, at first copious, then tough and finally purulent. During all this there is great asthmatic dyspnoea. Carbo veg. is an excellent remedy in all those cases of asthma where the shortness of breath is so marked that there is only a partial oxidation, as a result of which he suffers much from occipital headache and wants to be fanned.
Old cases of recurrent asthma. Every time there comes a warm wet spell his asthma comes on. It is common for Carbo veg. asthma to come on in the night. He goes to, bed without warning of an oncoming attack, only. He says,
"I don't like the weather;" and he wakes up with asthma.
He wakes up suffocating, springs out of bed and goes to the window or wants to be fanned. Carbo veg. required in old, badly-treated cases of pneumonia, with a remaining bronchitis; in cases where there has been hepatization that was not cleared up, and there are bad places in the lungs and bronchial tubes, with weakness of the chest.
Weakness of the chest when coughing. He feels that there is not enough force in the muscle of the chest to get up a good cough, or to help him carry on the breathing. Pneumonia, third stage, with foetid expectoration, cold breath, cold sweat, desire to be fanned.
Threatened paralysis of the lungs. This is a combination of clinical states that the remedy covers well. Sometimes these asthmatic cases go on for a while, and then comes an infiltration of tubercle. If Carbo veg. can be given early it will prevent infiltration.
There is pain in the chest, and burning. Burning in the lungs; burning in the sides of the chest; burning with the cough; burning behind the sternum - the whole length of the trachea; burning aggravated when coughing; a sense of rawness even when breathing. He feels a load upon the chest, an oppression, a great weight. These are the various words that he uses, all descriptive of the same thing.
Heart: The heart comes in for a great deal of trouble. It appears to be struggling. Of course it is the venous side of the heart that is in distress. The veins are engorged. it is a venous condition of the whole patient; the veins are performing their labor with great difficulty. A state of relaxation, struggling, and there are orgasms of blood - described by some of the authors as an orgasm, by others as a tumultuous action of the heart felt throughout the body.
Pulsation felt all over the body. Flushes of heat mounting upwards, ending in a sweat. Suitable, sometimes for women at the turn of life. Especially suitable to persons in advanced years.
Carbo veg. complaints come on in a weakly state in young people as if it were a premature old age in the middle-aged people; or in the breaking down that naturally belongs to old age. It is a great comforter for aged people with enlarged veins, or fullness of the veins and coldness of the extremities. Oozing of blood, with palpitation tumultuous action of the heart. The pounding goes on like a great machine, shaking the whole body.
The pulse is almost imperceptible. It seems as though the volume of blood ought to be tremendous, but it is not. Weakness of the whole vascular system. Pulse irregular, intermittent, frequent. Blood stagnates in the capillaries. Complete torper; impending paralysis of the heart. Burning in the region of the heart. With this there is an awful feeling of anxiety in the chest - in the region of the heart as if he were going to die, or as if something were going to happen. He feels that tumultuous action and tires out under it.
In going over the remedy I have said so much about the limbs, their coldness and the cold sweat, that I have practically covered most of the symptoms that belong to the extremities. Carbo veg. is an excellent remedy for the general constitutional disorder where there arc indolent varicose ulcers upon the lower limbs - the legs above the ankles.
There is no activity in these ulcers; thin watery discharge or it is thick. bloody and ichorous. Burning indolent ulcers; varicose, ulcers; swelling of the limbs. A gangrenous state from the extremely feeble circulation.
Gangrenous condition such as old people have, senile gangrene. The limbs wither; the toes and lower parts wither and look dusky. There are blisters upon them and they ooze a bloody, watery fluid. Burning like fire. Loss of sensation. Stiffness in the joints. Excoriating sweat between the toes, and numbness. Numbness in the limb lain on. If he lies on the right side, the right hand gets numb. It he turns over on the left side, the left arm gets numb.
The circulation in the part is so feeble that if there is any pressure the part becomes numb. The surface is cold. The extremities are cold. He is indolent, weak and always tired, with an aversion to mental and physical work. Every little exertion brings on a feeling as if he would faint and collapse.
The sleep is full of dreams. He wakes up with dyspnoea, wakes with cold limbs, especially cold knees. Legs drawn up during sleep. Unrefreshed after sleep. The dreams he has are the kind that most of these patients
have where the remedy acts so violently upon the veins, upon the basilar portion of the brain, and upon the voluntary system. They are awful. He dreams of fire, burglars, fearful and horrible things.
Anxiety, restlessness and congestion of the head prevent his going to sleep. Rush of blood to the head. His head feels hot, but to the hand the skin feels cold. The inner chest feels as if burning, but the outer chest feels cold to the hand. So it is in the abdomen. The feeling of internal heat and burning, with external coldness, is acommon feature of Carbo veg.
The fever is violent; it has a violent rigor or chill. Of course during the chill he is cold, but there is one strange feature, he wants cold water during the chill, and when the fever comes on he has no thirst.
That is strange; it is uncommon. It is common for patients to be thirsty when they are hot with fever, and when cold not to ask for water. It is common not to ask for water during sweat. But in this patient you observe coldness, rigor, cold breath, and even in the chill sometimes a cold sweat, and you say that it is peculiar that he drinks so much cold water. It is strange; it is uncommon; rare. Hence it is one of the strong features of Carbo veg. febrile conditions.
With the chill of this remedy one side of the body frequently feels in its natural state of heat, that is, naturally warm, while the other side, is cold. One-sided chill. Chill with icy coldness of the body. Chill with great thirst. Sweats easily, especially about the head and face Exhausting night or morning sweats. Sweat profuse, putrid or sour.
Low forms of fever like yellow fever, and a very low type of typhus and typhoid fevers. After the fever has somewhat subsided he has prolonged cold spells with lack of reaction. He does not seem to rally, but he is cold, his knees are cold, his breath is cold, cold sweat, a sort of paralytic weakness. Cadaveric aspect of the face. Cyanotic face. Coldness of the limbs.
Yellow fever in the last stage, the stage of haemorrhage, with great paleness of the face. Violent headache, trembling of the body, collapse with cold breath, cold sweat, cold nose. Nose and face pinched. Vital powers very low, tells a great deal of the story of Carbo veg.
Lack of reaction after some violent attack, some violent shock, some violent suffering. In weakly persons who give right out, with dyspnoea, coldness, copious sweat, exhaustion, collapse and cadaveric aspect, Carbo veg. must be*given.
Carbo veg. is indicated after surgical shock, when the patient goes into collapse, and is in danger of dying from the shock of the operation. This is before inflammation sets in, for there is not vitality enough to arouse an inflammation. The heart is too weak to establish reaction enough for an inflammation. Inflammation comes after a reaction. But if reaction does not take place, Carbo veg. is one of our most important remedies.

Causticum
Causticum is a very searching medicine, suitable in old, broken down constitutions, suffering from chronic diseases.
Only occasionally is it indicated in acute diseases. Its complaints are such as are progressive, slow, and accompanying a declining state of the economy.
Muscular power: Gradual decrease of muscular power, a paralysis. Paralysis of the oesophagus, paralysis of the throat, such as occurs after diphtheria; paralysis of the upper eyelids; paralysis of the bladder; paralysis of the limbs, of the lower limbs; great lassitude, muscular relaxation, indescribable fatigue and heaviness of the body. And there is a tremulousness, a quivering, jerking, twitching of the muscles, twitching in sleep.
Tendons: The next most striking feature is found in the tendons, which become shortened, resulting in a temporary or permanent contracture, and the limb is drawn up.
Tendons of the forearms contract, and there is gradually increasing flexion. Sometimes a whole muscle will harden and shorten, so that it can be felt by the hand as a hard ridge. Contractures of muscles and tendons.
Joints: Closely related to this is a rheumatic state of the tendons and ligaments about the joints, sometimes with swelling, but always with pain and ending in a shrivelling of the joint, a tightening up of the joint so that it becomes ankylosed.
Great stiffness of the joints, and while this is going on the patient is growing weaker, is running into a state of melancholy, of hopelessness, anxiety and fear.
Constantly present in his mind is the hopelessness and a feeling that something is hanging over him, that something is going to happen. These are general features of Causticum. They all go to make up one picture, they are inseparable.
Hysteria: Another kind of progressive trouble in Causticum is hysteria. Gradually increasing hysteria. Hysterical cramping. The woman loses all control of herself and says foolish things.
Her nervous system becomes extremely sensitive to noise, touch, excitement or anything unusual. Starting from the slightest noise; starting in sleep; twitching and jerking; the child is easily startled, or acts as if startled without cause.
Rheumatic diathesis: The paralytic weakness is associated with the rheumatic diathesis. The rheumatic states are peculiar. The patient himself can endure neither heat nor cold. They both aggravate his rheumatic conditions, his nervous conditions and himself in general. His pains are ameliorated by heat, but they are aggravated in dry weather.
Great deformity of the joints; they are enlarged, soft and infiltrated, always worse in dry weather; more pains and aches during dry weather. Rheumatism that affects both the muscles and the joints. This patient is also aggravated by exposure to cold, dry winds. Many an individual who has gone from the low lands of the East up into Colorado will come down with rheumatism from the cold, dry winds.
Let such a patient as I have described take a ride in the cold lake wind and he will have paralysis of the side of the face exposed to the wind. A long drive with the east wind coming against the face.
The next day that side of the face will be paralyzed. Such a paralysis will almost always recover under Causticum.
Reading, tearing, paralytic pains; pains that, benumb; pains that fairly take the life out of him, they are so severe. And they are likely to remain in one place for a long time. Causticum has often greatly mitigated the lightning-like pains of locomotor ataxia.
Now, with all these sufferings the patient is slowly growing weaker, till at length he can no longer walk, he can no longer sit up, he is so tired and weak that he must lie down. He is tired in body and mind. It isa paralytic fatigue.
Convulsive symptoms. Cramps, now here, now there. If frightened he is almost sure to have some form of convulsive condition, The woman with tendency to hysteria will have hysterics from fright; nervous girls that are more inclined to chorea, will start with jerking of muscles and will keep it up day and night. Chorea even at night. Localized chorea, jerking of single parts, chorea of the tongue or of one side of the face.
Epilepsy in young persons at the age of puberty, from fright, from, being chilled or exposed to some great change in the weather. Epilepsy, chorea, paralysis, hysteria worse during menses. We see that Causticum is a deep medicine.
Worse from exposure to cold, dry wind. It also has rheumatic complaints aggravated in the warm, damp days, in wet weather, but this is not so striking.
Any one of the complaints that I have mentioned may be brought on by bathing in cold water. A long, dry, cold spell will aggravate the rheumatic troubles, getting wet or becoming chilled by bathing will start them.
Insanity: Causticum has cured insanity; not acute mania with violent delirium, but mental aberration of the passive kind, where the brain has become tired. The constitution has been broken down with long suffering and much trouble, and finally the mind is in confusion.
At first the patient recognizes his inability to do anything and then comes this foreboding that something is going to happen. He is unable to think, and consequently unable to carry on his business. He is going into imbecility. Full of timorous fancies.
"Timorous anxiety,” overwhelmed with fearful fancies.
At every turn there is fear that something is going to happen. Fear of death, fear that something will happen to his family. Always anticipating some dreadful event. That is a striking feature of the Causticum mental state. It is found in old, broken down mental cases, after prolonged anxiety; after a prolonged struggle of some sort.
Anxiety before falling asleep. In addition to this, the Causticum patient lacks balance. Everything excites him. The more he thinks about his complaints, the worse they become. Mental and other ailments from long-lasting grief and sorrow. The injurious effects of fear and prolonged vexation. Tired from vexations of business.
Eruptions: The suppression of eruptions is apt to bring out mental symptoms. Mental exhaustion, hopelessness, despair, appearing after the suppression of an eruption with zinc ointment. He was fairly well while he had the eruption, but when it disappeared his mind gave out.
Eruptions on the side of the head and face, and extending over the whole head. Thick, crusty eruptions covering the whole occiput. When these eruptions are suppressed in children, chorea is apt to follow. In the adult there will be trembling, paralytic weakness and the mental state, sometimes pains in the nerves.
Headaches: The driving in of a facial eruption will frequently result in facial paralysis. The healing of an old ulcer with stimulating lotions and ointments will have a similar result. Then he also suffers from violent headaches, congestive, pulsating headaches; violent, stitches in the head, worse in the evening.
But the headaches are, as a rule, nondescript; only occasion do we find a Causticum headache standing out by itself. It will usually be associated with rheumatic and gouty conditions which also affect the scalp. The scalp contracts and tightens up in places like the contractures in other parts. Rheumatic headaches; sometimes the pain is so severe as to cause nausea, and vomiting. Blinding headaches followed by paralysis.
Torticollis. The head is sometimes drawn to one side by the shortening of the muscles of the neck. Causticum is a curative remedy in this shortening of the tendons and muscles.
Eyes: Causticum is rich in eye symptoms. Very often the patient says that the eyelids feel so heavy that he can hardly hold them up. This gradually increases until it becomes an actual paralysis. Sometimes there is the appearance of a veil before the eyes; foggy vision.
Flickering before the eyes. Air seems full of little black insects. Then, again, large black or green spots are seen. After looking at the light a green spot appears and remains in the field of vision for a long time. Diplopia.
And the vision gradually grows weaker until it is lost. Paralysis of the optic nerve. Lachrymation, tears acrid, burning; ulceration, copious discharges from the eyes, agglutination of the lids, paralysis of the eye muscles.
Causticum cures scrofulous ophthalmia with ulceration of the cornea; chronic, purulent ophthalmia of psoric origin. The cornea is covered with little veins.
Warts: Another very strong feature of this medicine is its tendency to grow warts. Warts on the face, on the tip of the nose, on the ends of the fingers, on the hands.
Hard, dry, horny warts come out on various parts of the body.
It is natural feature of this remedy to produce copious, thick, tough, gluey discharges from mucous membranes.
Ear and nose: The catarrhal troubles creep up the Eustachian tube, from the nose and throat into the car, resulting in roarings, cracking noises and reverberations in the ear. There is great accumulation of car wax;
deafness of catarrhal origin and deafness from paralysis of the auditory nerve. Severe, dragging pains in the ear.
The nasal catarrh is very troublesome. Old, atrophic catarrh with accumulation of crusts throughout the whole nasal cavity; post-nasal catarrh with ulcerations, granulations and copious, thick, yellow or yellowish- green discharge; nose-bled; frequent attacks of acrid, watery coryza. Much itching of the nose. A wart grows upon the tip of the nose.
Face and mouth: The pains in the face are violent. Neuralgic pains from exposure to cold. These pains often accompany the facial paralysis. Tearing pains in the face, stitching pains, pains of a rheumatic character.
Ulcerations about the mouth and nose. Fissures about the lips, the wings of the nose and the corners of the eyes. Fissures seem to form upon the least provocation. Fissures of the anus, of the skin about the joints. Old cases of salt rheum with fissures in the bends of the joints. Fistulous openings with indurated walls.
The gums become scorbutic and settle away from the teeth; bleeding and ulceration of the gums. Violent, tearing pains in the roots of the teeth from riding in the wind. Old rheumatic subjects suffer all through every dry spell with toothache.
Stitching, tearing, pulsating pains in the teeth; even in the sound teeth on drawing in cold air. Frequently recurring abscesses of the gums. Putrid sour or bitter taste in the mouth.
When the paralytic condition affects the tongue then we have stammering. There is also the condition of complete paralysis of both the pharynx and oesophagus. Hence Causticum is useful in the results of diphtheria when it has been maltreated or when the remedy has not been sufficient to cure the disease.
The food goes down the wrong way or enters the larynx or the post-nares. Paralysis of the organs of speech, paralysis of the tongue, awkward at talking, awkward at chewing; bites the tongue and cheeks while chewing. Post-diphtheritic paralysis is a serious condition and only a few remedies can cure- it.
Causticum is one of them. Lachesis and Cocculus are also important. Dryness of the mouth and throat; rawness of the throat; must swallow constantly on account of a sensation of fullness in the throat, a nervous feeling in the throat. This is often a forerunner of paralysis. The Staphysagria patient when excited will keep up a constant swallowing and this goes on until it becomes a source of great annoyance.
Burning in the throat; jerking in the throat; constantly scraping thick, tough mucus from the larynx. Study the sounds that patients make in order to ascertain where the mucus comes from. The presence of hoarseness shows that the trouble is in the larynx.
Desires and aversions, stomach: The Causticum patient sits down to the table hungry, but on seeing the food his appetite vanishes. The thought, sight or smell of food takes away the appetite. This is a common symptom in the pregnant woman.
Although hungry, on sitting down at the table, she cannot eat. Kali carbonicum has an empty, all-gone feeling in the stomach, with aversion to food. China has canine hunger, but loathes the sight of food.
Thirst after eating; thirst for cool drinks with aversion to water desire for beer, smoked meats, pungent things, aversion to sweet things and delicacies. Most remedies that have loss of appetite have desire for, sweet things, pastry, etc. The symptoms of thirst with aversion to drinking is very much like Lachesis.
The two run very closely together in the paralytic condition of the throat. There is a queer sensation in the stomach as if lime were slaking there. Trembling in the stomach; burning. Bread causes a sensation of heaviness and pressure, coffee seems to aggravate all the symptoms of the stomach, but a swallow of cold water relieves.
Many symptoms in this remedy are made better by a swallow of water. The violent spasmodic cough may be stopped at once by a drink of cold water. Cold water seems to tone up the paralytic condition. Warm water applied to the hands brings on pains in these old sensitive spinal conditions. Cold washing is their only relief.
Causticum has belching, nausea, vomiting, distension and violent pains in the stomach. Pinching colic.
Rectum: In the rectum there is the same tendency to paralytic weakness that is found in other parts of the body. It is inactive and fills up with hard faeces, which pass involuntarily and unnoticed. Aloe has involuntary dropping of little, hard balls, especially in children. Even when old enough to understand about such things, they will pass little balls unnoticed.
On account of the paralytic condition the stool passes with less straining while the patient is standing. Retention of urine except when standing; unable to pass it in any other position is Sarsaparilla. Constipation, frequent, unsuccessful urging to stool. The stool is tough and shining, and is passed with great difficulty and exertion.
Fissures in the anus; itching and stitching in the rectum, excessive itching day and night; hemorrhoids, pulsating in the perineum I fissures and hemorrhoids pulsate and burn like fire.
The hemorrhoids become infiltrated and hardened.
Bladder: This remedy has two kinds of paralysis of the bladder, one affecting the muscles of expulsion and the urine is retained, and the other center ing upon the sphincter vesicae, and then the urine is passed involuntarily.
"He urinates so easily that he is not sensible of the stream and scarcely believes, in the dark, that he is urinating, until he makes sure by sense of touch."
Causticum is unconscious of the stream as it passes.
It is a very useful remedy in children that wet the bed. Especially is it a wonderful remedy in the woman. The urine escapes involuntarily when coughing. Retention of urine in the woman. Retention after labor.
Paralysis of the bladder. A woman who is too greatly embarrassed to pass through a crowd of observing men to the closet at the end of a railroad car, at the end of the journey finds that she is unable to pass the urine.
Retention of urine from straining the muscles of the bladder. If the patient is chilled at the time the remedy may be Rhus.
Rhus and Causticum are the two great remedies for paralytic weakness of muscles from being overstrained, or from being overstrained and chilled. Great weakness at the time of the menses.
Menstruation: Anxious dreams before menstruation; melancholy; cramp-like spasms; pains in the back. The woman suffers from many annoyances during menstruation just about the time for the flow to start violent cramp-like pains come on. In a woman who is nursing a child the milk almost disappears in consequence of fatigue, night watching and anxiety. The nipples get sore and crack, another instance of the tendency to form fissures.
Voice: The Causticum patient has trouble with the voice. You remember, when we were going over the symptoms of Carbo vegetabilis, I told you that the hoarseness was worse in the evening. Now observe that the hoarseness of Causticum is worse in the morning.
He gets up in the morning with a hoarse voice; if it is an ordinary case, after moving about and expectorating a little mucus, it is better. Sudden loss of voice from paralysis of the vocal cord.
It sometimes begins with the morning aggravation, gradually increasing until it lasts all day and all night.
Cough: The Causticum cough is a hard cough and racks the whole body. The chest seems full of mucus and he feels if only he could cough a little deeper he could get it up, and he struggles and coughs until exhausted or until he finds out that a drink of cold water will relieve. But it must be ice cold.
The cough is hollow, it sounds as if he were coughing into a barrel. It is relieved by expectoration if it can only get deep enough to reach the mucus. Sometimes such a cough precedes quick consumption. It is a deep-acting medicine; it cures phthisis, especially mucous phthisis or quick consumption.
"Cough with a sensation as if the patient could not cough deep enough to start the mucus; produced by tickling, accompanied by rawness. Cough wakens her from sleep in the evening and morning.
Cough relieved by a swallow of cold water. Cough worse by bending forward. Continual, annoy ing cough; with each cough escape of urine."
Influenza with tired aching of the limbs as if they had been beaten. "Whooping cough in the catarrhal stage."
Great soreness and tightness of the chest, oppression of the chest it feels as if a load were upon it. It seems to be filling up with mucus, and the patient coughs until he raises a mouthful and then he feels a little better for a time. Pale as death, covered with sweat.
Back: There are many symptoms in the back. Pain and stiffness; stiffness on rising from a seat. Stiffness in the limbs, through the hips and in the back, so that he rises up from sitting or the recumbent posture with great difficulty.
In most cases the pains and aches are ameliorated by the warmth of the bed and by applied heat. Only the pains in the fingers are sometimes brought on by heat.
Chamomilla
The general constitutional state of Chamomilla is great sensitiveness; sensitive to every impression; sensitive to surroundings; sensitive to persons; and, above all, sensitive to pain.
The constitutional irritability is so great that a little pain brings forth manifestations as if the patient were in very, great suffering. It naturally belongs to the woman's nervous system, when she is wrought up and extremely sensitive and in pain.
Mind: The mental state goes along with this. Sensitiveness of the mind. Great irritability. These two run through Chamomilla so closely that they are inseparable. Sensitiveness to pain. Easily affected by mortification, by chagrin, so that the nerves become extremely sensitive from these causes, and pains, convulsions, colic, headaches and other kinds of nervous symptoms set in.
The nervous child when punished will go into convulsions. The oversensitive nervous woman will suffer from chagrin. Jerking and twitching of muscles from mortification and excitement. Excessive sensibility of the nerves, so excessive that only a few remedies equal it, such as Coffea, Nux vom. and Opium.
Of course, without hearing a lecture on Opium you naturally think of Opium as capable of producing stupor. Those of you who have seen, the awful state of mind and distress that follow the administration of the crude Opium will understand what I mean by the Chamomilla sensitivity. Convulsions of children.
Convulsions: It is not an uncommon thing, even now-a-days, and especially when practicing in the country, for the young mothers and the nurses to give for baby Camomile tea for colic, and the baby goes into convulsions. No one attributes it to Camomile tea, but the doctor will see at once, if he knows Chamomilla, that these convulsions are due to Camomile.
Then you see the jerkings, the convulsions, the hot head, the great sensitivity; sensitiveness, to noise, and to persons, and the great irritability between the convulsions, convulsions of children; they become stiff; roll the eyes; distort the face; twitchings of muscles; throw the limbs about; clinch the thumbs; bend the body backwards.
Such is the natural appearance of the Chamomilla convulsions; those convulsions that come on in oversensitive children, when they have suffered a good deal of pain from teething. Teething ought to be a perfectly healthy process, but it is really looked upon as a disease, and many doctors carry medicines for "teething children,” and administer them; first one and then another.
Chamomilla has fallen into that bad use of being given "for teething”. It is true that many children suffer from irritability of the brain, convulsions, stomach disorders and vomiting about the time of dentition, but I say dentition should not be a diseased state, it should be normal.
If they were in healthy they would cut teeth without sufferings. But slow teething we have to contend with, and that irritable state, that oversensitiveness, so that he child does not sleep. Wakes up as if it had awful dreams. Wakes up in excitement, vomits, has diarrhea with teething.
These symptoms come at this time when the child has not been properly looked after. Or perhaps the mother has not been properly qualified for parturition.
"Tetanic convulsions. Twitching in the eyelids.
Pain in the limbs.
General prostration, faintness."
Neuralgic pains all over the body with numbness. Twitching, darting, tingling pains. The pains are mostly ameliorated by heat, with the exception of the teeth and jaws. Toothache, pain in the teeth ameliorated by cold, and made worse by heat. But the earaches and pains in the extremities are made better by heat.
You will see in the text under "Temperature and Weather" the symptom:
"Pains are worse from heat," with two black bars as if it were the most important symptom in it, and then below, without any bar,
"Sensitive to cold. Chilly," and "Better from heat;" but the fact is the pains that are worse from heat are about the teeth and jaws, and it is decidedly a particular symptom relating only to a part; whereas it is true that the patient in the general state, entirely
contrary to what this says, is better by heat.
The pains in general are better by heat. The patient himself is better by heat. Consequently, this being a particular, it should state that the pains that are so commonly worse by heat are of the teeth.
The most important part of Chamomilla is the mental state. It pervades the whole economy and you will see that every region that is taken up, every part that is studied, brings into it the mental state of the patient.
This remedy has more mental symptoms than symptoms in any other part. Crying.
"Piteous moaning. Irritable."
The irritability is so great that it manifests itself sometimes in a very singular way. The patient seems to be driven to frenzy by the pains, and she forgets all about her prudence and her diplomacy.
Loss of generosity: she has no consideration for the feelings of others. She will simply enter into a quarrel or dispute regardless of the feelings of anybody.
So, when you go into practice, do not be surprised when you go to the bedside of a patient in labor, who is full of pains and sufferings, if she says:
"Doctor, I don't want you, get out." just such an one will pass under other circumstances as a lady. The awful pains that she is having drive her to frenzy, and this frenzy, this oversensitiveness to pain, is coupled with the mental state.
Inability to control her temper, and the temper is aroused to white heat. Now, in the child, the child whines and cries and sputters about everything. It wants something new every minute. It refuses everything that it
has asked for. If it is for something to eat, for something to play with, for its toys, when these are handed to the child it throws them away; slings them clear across the room.
Strikes the nurse in the face for presuming to, get something or other that the little one did not want, yet had asked for. Capriciousness. It seems that the pains and sufferings are sometimes ameliorated by passive motion, this very particularly in children.
The pains seem to be better when the child is carried, so the child wants to be carried all the time. This is true in the colic and in the bowel troubles. It is true with earache; it is true with the evening fevers, and the general sufferings from cold and conditions while teething.
Children must be carried. The nurse is compelled to carry the child all the time. And then there is the restlessness and capriciousness about the members of the family. The child goes two or three times up and down the room with the nurse, and then reaches out for its mother; goes two or three times up and down the room with her and then wants to go to its father. And so it is changing about. Never satisfied. It seems to have no peace.
When it has earache the sharp shooting pains cause the child to screech out. Carries the hand to the ear. The pains often cause that sharp, piercing tone of the voice. Adults in pain cannot keep still the pains are so severe; it is not always that they are decidedly ameliorated by moving, but they seem to be. But they move because they cannot keep still.
So the Chamomilla patient is tossing in bed, if in bed; not an instant quiet. And along with all of these the same irritability; becomes violently excited at the pain angry at the pain; irritable about the pain; will scold about the pain the pain is so torturesome. Aversion to talk, and snappish. The patient is constantly sitting and looking within herself when pains are absent.
Chamomilla has melancholy, and has suffering of the mind, without pain. Then the Chamomilla patient sits and thinks within herself a sort of introspection. Cannot be induced to say a word. Sadness. The Chamomilla child cannot be touched.
Wants to do as he pleases. Wants to change; wants to do something new. The answer from both the adult and the child are snappish. Complaints come on from contradiction; from anger. Convulsions come on from anger.
If the child is suffering from, whooping cough it will have a coughing spell, a spasmodic cough from being irritated. Goes into a spunky state, gets red in the face, and then gets to coughing. Peevishness.
"Quarrelsome. Easily chagrined or excited to anger. Bad effects of having the feelings wounded."
Such is the mental state, and, as I have remarked, that mental state will be found wherever there is an inflammatory condition that Chamomilla fits. In pneumonia, in bronchitis, laryngitis, inflammations of the
ear, erysipelas, headaches, fevers, Chamomilla. is capable of curing when the mental state is present, and the symptoms, in particular, are present.
Headache: The headaches of Chamomilla are found in sensitive people, sensitive women, nervous; overstrained; overtired. Fidgety. Excitable women that suffer from pain. A little headache seems an enormous thing. Throbbing, tearing, bursting pains. Congestive headaches.
Worse when thinking of the pain, or when thinking about the sufferings. The headaches are worse evenings. A particular time in the evening for many complaints to be worse is 9 o'clock. Sometimes 9 o'clock in the morning, and sometimes g in the evening.
Fever condition worse 9 o'clock in the morning. Pains worse in the evening, and especially worse about 9 o'clock. Stitching, tearing pains in the temples and head. Wandering pains in the temples.
Pressing pain in the head as soon as attention was directed to it, better by busying the mind at something else, or by occupation; forcing one's self to do something, and to think of something else. Congestion to the head. Violent neuralgia of the face, teeth, ear’ sides of the head. Pains inside of the mouth are ameliorated by cold. Pains of the ear and sides of the head are ameliorated by heat; earache ameliorated by heat.
Eyes: There are pains in the eyes. Inflammation of the eyes with bleeding. Oozing of a bloody water from the eyes of the new born infant. Chamomilla will cure if there is irritability of the temper.
Profuse acrid discharges; yellow discharges; discharges of purulent matter from the eyes. Violent pressure in the orbit. Lachrymation accompanying coryza with sneezing. Stuffing up of the nose. Headaches, irritability.
Associated with the above is a symptom:
"Face red and hot on one side, the other side pale."
Ears: Like the whole constitution of the remedy there is a great sensitiveness of hearing. Roaring, ringing and singing in the ears. Stitching pains in the ears, ameliorated by heat. Pressing earache.
You will see the little one when the pain comes on put its hands up to its ears, and spitefully moaning, yelling and screaming. Violent pains in the ear. When old enough to talk about it will complain of heat in the ear, and a feeling of fullness as if the ear were obstructed or stuffed up.
In adults, nervous, sensitive women who cannot ride in the wind without covering up their cars. The ears are so sensitive to air when other parts of the face and head are not sensitive to air.
You will find some patients that can not have air touch the neck. Others have extra covering between the shoulders. Chamomilla singles out the ears. The whole body is sensitive to air and to cold, and he wants to dress with plenty of covering.
Sneezing, watery coryza. Hot face on one side, and often with pains in the head and jaws. Fluent coryza, viscid, acrid, with loss of smell. Loss of smell lasting while the cold lasts.
Face: Rending pains in the face, sometimes involving the teeth and the outer face at the same time. It is not an uncommon thing to have a very sensitive woman if she is disturbed by chagrin, if she has been vexed
by her servant, to go to her room and suffer tortures from pain in the face from that excitement, from anger.
If it is the outer nerves in the face the pains will be ameliorated by heat; but when it affects the teeth the pains will be ameliorated by cold. Heat of the face, while the rest of the body is cold.
"The face sweats after eating or drinking." It is acommon feature of this remedy to sweat only about the head, the hairy scalp.
Sometimes during measles or scarlet fever we will have Chamomilla manifestations. Sweating about the head, face red on one side.
"One-sided swelling of the check;"
that is, an inflammatory attack, gets redder, and redder, and finally purple, going into erysipelas, with the mental symptoms.
Hot face, redness of one side. Burning in the face. Neuralgia of the face. If anything warm is taken into the mouth it will bring on aching in the teeth, and sometimes burning and throbbing in the roots of the teeth; tearing, stitching, stinging pains, aggravated by talking; aggravated in the open air; aggravated in a warm
room, or getting warm in bed, anything that heats up the body will aggravate this toothache; ameliorated by holding cold drinks in the mouth.
Teeth and gums: Toothache that is entirely absent in the daytime; as soon as it comes night, and the patient gets into the warm bed, then these shooting, tearing pains begin; with the irritability, oversensitiveness to pain, the mental state, hot head, you have the Chamomilla toothache.
"Swelling and inflammation of the gums.
Threatened abscess of the gums.
Toothache when coming into a warm room," when it has been better in the cold air. This toothache is one that may be brought on by taking cold, by exposing one's self to cold air when sweating; and yet the toothache itself when present is ameliorated by cold.
"Toothache from a draft of air." "Ameliorated from eating cold things. Worse before midnight."
The most of the troubles of Chamomilla that come on in the evening and night subside about or sometimes before midnight.
"From midnight to morning almost all of the complaints of Chamomilla, are absent. Many of them are absent during the day.
It has aggravation in the forepart of the night.
"Teeth feel too long. Swollen gums."
The Chamomilla infant will often hold a glass of cold water against the gums. The little one has inflamed gums, painful gums, the coming forth of the teeth is painful, and it seems to want to prolong the cold in the mouth; when it is so young you would not think it would realize the good of making use of the cold edge of the glass. Offensive foetid smell from the mouth.
The spasms that affect the child all over are likely to affect the larynx, and sometimes affect the larynx without affecting the child anywhere else.
"Spasms of the larynx during cough, or without cough. Spasmodic constriction of the larynx.
Choking.
Spasms of the throat. Sore and inflamed."
Throat: Chamomilla, cures sore throat when the throat is of a uniform redness, spreading pretty evenly over the whole throat, with considerable swelling. Inflammation of tonsils. Much redness; when the mental state is present. It will never cure a sore throat except in these irritable constitutions, such as suffer from pain, such as are easily angered, in a constant fret. The Chamomilla mental state determines when you ne to give Chamomilla in sore throat.
"Want of appetite. Great thirst for cold water and desire for acid drinks. Unquenchable thirst."
Aversion to coffee, warm drinks, to soups and liquid foods, The aversion to coffee is a strange thing. Chamomilla and coffee are very much alike in the general sensitivity of the economy. They antidote each other. When persons have been overdrinking coffee, nurses drinking coffee to keep up at night to take care of the patient; persons overdrinking coffee when tired and overworked. Chamomilla is its antidote.
"Thirsty, and hot with the pains."
When the pains come, no matter where, she heats up, and sometimes becomes really feverish. Face red, especially on one side. Head hot; extreme irritability.
Chamomilla has much vomiting. Eructations of gas which smells like sulphuretted hydrogen. The Chamomilla patient has violent retching. Making violent efforts to vomit. Seems that it will tear the stomach. Covered with cold sweat. Exhausted. That is just what Morphine does.
If you have ever seen a patient who has been overdosed by a doctor - I hope that you will never see one that has been overdosed by yourself. Do not make a case, you will have one soon enough, but if you get into a town where there is an allopathic physician, and he happens to give Morphine to one of these oversensitive patients; it may relieve her pain for a little while, but on will come the awful eructations, and she will retch and vomit, and continue to retch when there is nothing to vomit.
Chamomilla will stop that, the first dose, in a few minutes, and it is the only remedy you will need. It will always stop the vomiting from Morphine after the crude effect of Morphine has passed away and the vomiting comes.
Colics: Colic, especially in the little ones, in the infants. Pain in the stomach and abdomen, The child doubles up, and screams, and kicks; wants to be carried; is extremely irritable; attack comes on in the evening; one side of the face red, the other side pale; wants things, and when they are given does not want them; and you have a Chamomilla colic.
It is a wind colic. It lasts a fraction of a minute, and then it straightens out again. It shows that it is a cramp, a wind-cramp. in adults, who have felt these symptoms, they are said to be cutting, burning, griping. Griping pains.
Of course, such are the pains that are called colicky. Cramps in the bowels. Griping pains. Sometimes griping as if must go to stool The abdomen distended like a drum. Sometimes ameliorated by warm applications.
"Colic while urinating;" that is an uncommon symptom. "Colic in the morning. Tympanitic abdomen."
The most striking Chamomilla stool is grass green, or like chopped eggs, or like these two chopped up; yellow and white, intermingled with mucus that is grass green, like chopped grass; chopped spinach. Greenish, slimy discharges, greenish water.
Those old enough to express themselves in the proving said that the stool felt hot while it passed. It smells like sulphuretted hydrogen. Copious stool; scanty stool, with dysenteric straining. Watery diarrhoea, six or eight passages daily. Mucous diarrhoea. Green, watery stool, feeces and mucus.
"Yellowish brown stool."
Also constipation, with no ability to strain. A paralytic weakness of the rectum; inactivity of the rectum. Anus is "pouting," with swollen appearance and redness.
Women: The woman, such as I have described, oversensitive to pain, snappish, suffering intensely from a little pain, takes on many symptoms at the menstrual period. The menstrual flow is black, clotted, offensive. Cramping pains in the uterus, clutching and griping, ameliorated by heat.
"Oversensitive to pain,” with all the pains and complaints, and the mental state, the irritability, the snappish mental state at a menstrual period. Whether it be a menorrhagia, or a metrorrhagia, there are copious black clots.
"Menstrual colic following anger," which means violent cramping pains in the uterus during menstruation if she has had any great excitement to anger her. Sexual irritability, emotions, disturbance of mind, will bring on cramps at the menstrual period in a woman who is not subject to cramps, affecting her as if she had taken cold.
It is a very useful remedy in membranous dysmenorrhoea. It, perhaps, has existed from the first menstrual period. Every month the woman throws off a little membranous formation. This is thrown off with violent labor-like pains, and often with clots.
Chamomilla may be a palliative. It is not the constitutional remedy that clears away, and prevents the future formation of this membrane, like the deeper antipsorics, but it is often palliative in the more severe attacks, with the irritable condition of the mind; feverish condition, ameliorated by heat; cramping, and clutching like labor pains,
"Yellow, smarting leucorrhoea.
Excessive menstruation; blood dark, nearly black, clotted, with pain through from back to front, attacks of syncope, coldness of limbs, much thirst."
Pregnancy: In pregnancy the woman has also Chamomilla conditions. Irregular contractions; false labor pains. Labor pains that are felt in wrong places. Labor pains that are felt too much in the back.
Contractions that are most painful, cutting, tearing, bringing out screams. so irritable; she scolds the pains; she scolds the doctor; she scolds everybody; drives the doctor out of the room; drives the nurse off, and then calls for her again; refuses things that are offered.
Labor pains that are clutching here, and clutching there, and cramping, showing that certain fibres of the uterus are contracting in one direction, and certain other fibres in another. There is not that uniform, regular contraction that should take place in the expulsion of the contents of the uterus; expulsion of a mole or expulsion of a child.
If the physician can have the pregnant woman under his care during the period of gestation he ought to be able to select remedies to remove these irregular contractions of the uterus, or to prevent them when it comes time for labor. The pains are then not so violent. She feels the contractions, but in many instances they are painless.
You will not always be able to prepare women, they will not always permit it. Women are more inclined to be notional and whimsical and to have their own way a short time before confinement than at any other time. A woman ought to be under treatment all through, gestation, and sometimes it takes longer.
Gestation is a fortuitous time for the woman to take treatment. Symptoms representative of her disordered state come out then that do not appear at any other time. If she has a psoric condition it may remain dormant until pregnancy comes on, which may act as an exciting cause to bring out the conditions that are in the constitution.
It furnishes, therefore, a good time for the homoeopathic physician to study the case and give that woman a constitutional remedy based upon those symptoms that will not only remove those symptoms and prepare her for confinement, but will remove very much of the disorder in her economy, and she will go on through life liberated from much distress, cured from many conditions that perhaps would not have come out until some other occasion brought them out.
A woman that knows much about Homoeopathy would submit herself regularly to constitutional treatment during gestation, that is, would be particular to give the physician everything, all the details, all the sufferings, all the trouble, that he may study that case.
The things that are to be observed during gestation are to be added to the constitutional. symptoms found when gestation is not present, because they are all evidence of a disturbance in that one patient. And it is the patient that is to be treated, not a disease. It is simply another form of disturbance, of disorder of the economy.
The things that Chamomilla reaches during confinement, and during its course, and at the close of it, are irregular contractions, like hourglass contractions.
"Rigidity of the os."
After confinement, after pains. With all these the same mental condition, the same oversensitiveness to pain.
"Postpartum hemorrhage."
Every time the child is put to the breast, cramping of the uterus; cramp in the back. Either of these, or both, Chamomilla cures. The two principal remedies you will have to rely on for these conditions, cramping in the back and cramping in the abdomen every time the child is put to die breast, are Chamomilla and Pulsatilla.
They are two decidedly different remedies in the mental sphere. One is mild and gentle, though whimsical; and the other is snappish and irritable. Both are sensitive to pain, but Chamomilla is far more sensitive to pain than Pulsatilla.
Chamomilla has inflammation of the mammary glands. You cannot prescribe for that unless you have something along with it, and I am sure you will recognize a Chamomilla patient. The woman goes into convulsions.
At the beginning of the confinement the husband comes into the room in some snappish way, "to make his wife behave herself;" it makes her mad, and she goes into convulsions.
The doctor, perhaps, has just turned his back upon it, but now he says,
"Well, why did I not think to give this woman a dose of Chamomilla?
If I had done that I would have prevented these convulsions."
She becomes very philosophical after a dose of Chamomilla, and often goes to sleep.
Chest, cough and respiration: There are many suffocative attacks and difficulties of breathing, inflammation of the larynx, that you can read up easily.
The cough of Chamomilla has some striking things in it. It is a hard cough, a dry, backing cough. The child goes to sleep at night and coughs and does not wake up. Coughs in its sleep, It is a little feverish has taken cold, and one side of the face is flushed.
It is crabbed when it is awake. The child becomes angry when it has a cold and a little cough, and a little disturbance of the larynx and bronchial tubes has been noticed coming on, and all at once it becomes more
excitable, wants to be carried, and if not pleased, or is angered, it will go into a hard coughing spell, and cough and vomit.
"Coughing spells from anger." That is, he coughs when there is already a cold or a cough, and if the patient becomes angry he has a fit of coughing. The coughing complaints, and chest complaints, and laryngeal complaints are generally worse at
night.
The feverish condition comes on at night with the Chamomilla colds, with the Chamomilla whooping cough, with the Chamomilla chest complaints.
Most of the complaints of Chamomilla are better after midnight. From g o'clock to midnight they are worse. "Dry cough worse at night and during sleep."
Dry cough from catching cold. Rough, scraping cough of children in winter, with tickling in sus sternal fossa, worse at night.
Dry cough, continuing during sleep. Amelioration of cough when getting warm in bed. Chamomilla is a very common remedy in whooping cough, where the child wants to be carried; keeps the nurse busy all the time. Coughs and gags and vomits, and it is very irritable and capricious in all of its wants and coughs during sleep.
You can now easily detect the chest symptoms. They go with the mental symptoms and the irritability and cough. The cough in the chest is scarcely different from the cough in the larynx and the cough from cold.
It is the same Chamomilla cough. Cough during sleep. During most of the complaints, fevers, colds, acute complaints and little attacks, burning of the extremities.
Limbs: Stitching pains in the limbs. Cramping in the muscles. Limbs go to sleep. With the pains in the limbs, and sometimes in other parts, but particularly in the limbs, a benumbed feeling, or pains with the feeling of deadness, pains accompanied by a benumbed feeling; sometimes almost complete loss of sensation of the skin, yet the pains in the long nerves in the extremities are very violent, and the patient seems just as sensitive to pain as at other times.
Extremely sensitive to pain, but the pains themselves cause a benumbing feeling to follow them.
It has been called in Older books a paralyzing pain. Convulsions of the extremities. Convulsions of the whole body.
"Cramps in the legs and calves. Tearing pains in the feet following a severe chill. Burning of the soles at night, puts the feet out of bed."
All the routine prescribers whenever. the patient is known to put the feet out of bed give Sulphur,, yet there is a large list of remedies with hot feet, burning soles, and all of them will put the feet out of bed, of course, to cool them off.
There is no reason why they should all get Sulphur.
Another feature of the pains that come on at night, sometimes, before midnight is, they are so violent that he cannot keep still. When the child has pains he wants to be carried, that seems to do him good. When the adult has pains at night in bed he gets up and walks the floor.
Benumbing pains, pains ameliorated by heat, pains that drive him out of bed at night, with twitchings of the limbs.
Oversensitiveness to pain. Great irritability. Sleep: The Chamomilla patient can not go to sleep at night. He is sleepy, like Bell., but he cannot sleep. If he quiets down during the day he wants to go to sleep. But as soon as the time comes to go to bed he is
wide awake, he is sleepless and restless at night, especially the fore part.
At times the Chamomilla patient becomes so full of visions and so much excited during the forepart of the night in his efforts to go to sleep that when be does go to sleep he jerks and twitches and has horrid dreams, and is full of sufferings.
"Anxious dreams. Sees horrible apparitions and starts; dreams about fatal accidents."
Worn out mentally from trying to go to sleep, and he is tired out.
Chelidonium
Chelidonium is a remedy more suitable for acute diseases, though it cures certain chronic conditions. It is not a very deep acting remedy. It is about like Bryonia in its general plane, length and depth of action.
It has been used principally in gastric and intestinal catarrhs, in acute and semi-chronic liver troubles, and in right-sided pneumonia.
Skin: The skin is likely to be sallow, and gradually increases to a marked jaundice in connection with these complaints. Semi-chronic gastritis, with jaundice.
"Gastro-duodenal catarrh.
Congestion and soreness in the liver, with jaundice.
Right-sided pneumonia, complicated with liver troubles, or jaundice."
This remedy seems to act throughout the system, but almost always along with it the liver is involved, and
it is suitable for what the old people and the doctors called "biliousness.” The patient is generally bilious, has nausea and vomiting. Distension of the veins. Yellowish grey color of the skin.
Mind: Very few mental symptoms have been brought out in its proving not enough to give us a good idea of the desires and aversions. We do not get a clear idea of the intellectual faculties. It needs further proving, yet in many regions it has had superabundance of proving.
"Sadness and anxiety."
Brooding over some sort of trouble generally runs through the mental state.
"Anxiety, allowing no rest," keeping the patient uneasy day and night.
Sadness, as if she had committed a crime; as if some dreadful thing was going to happen. So sad that she thinks she must die
"Weeping despondency. Distaste for mental exertion and conversation.
If you examine those medicines that act primarily upon the liver, that slow down the action of the liver, you will find the word melancholia."
With heart troubles, great excitement, With liver troubles, slowing down of the mental state, inability of the mind to work, sluggishness of the mind, inability to think, inability to meditate, slow pulse. Sluggishness of the whole economy.
Dizziness: The sensorium is very commonly disturbed, and the patient is dizzy. "Things go round in a circle."
Dizziness comes, and it does not let up until nausea, and sometimes vomiting, follows. "So much turning in the head that he vomits.
Confusion of mind.
Loss of consciousness and fainting."
These are also common features with liver troubles.
The mind symptoms are present more or less with the following liver symptoms; there are pains of a dull aching character, "soreness." Bruised pains. Tenderness of the liver to touch. Aching pains, that seem to involve the whole right lobe of the liver; creating a sensation of fullness. Pressure upwards, with difficulty of breathing. Pressure downwards, sympathetic with the stomach, with the nausea and vomiting.
Right scapula: And then more intense pain felt under the right scapula.
"Dull aching pains under the right scapula; sharp, shooting pains under the right scapula"; these complicate themselves again with pneumonia, with pleurisy.
It cures pneumonia and pleurisy; it cures various forms of congestion in the liver, when these pains go from before backward, and seem to be felt through the back.
"Stitching in the region of the liver, extending through to back. Hard pains felt through the back."
Some patients will describe these pains as shooting pains; some as tearing pains, and others as sharp pains, going through the right hypochondrium or through the right lobe of the liver to the back.
"Pains from the region of the liver, shooting towards the back and shoulders. Spasmodic pain in the region of the liver. Pressing pain in the region of the liver."
In congestion or inflammation, fullness and enlargement, semi-chronic cases, or even acute, this medicine proves suitable for such conditions. The right hypochondrium is tense and painful to pressure.
This remedy has cured gall stone colic. Practitioners, who know how to direct a remedy, relieve gall stone colic in a few minutes. We have remedies that act on the circular fibres of these little tubes, causing them to relax and allow the stone to pass painlessly.
In a perfect state of health, of course, there are no stones in the bile that is held in the gall bladder, but this little cystic duct opens its mouth and a little gall stone engages in it, and it creates and irritation by scratching along the mucous membrane of that little tube.
When this pain is a shooting, stabbing, tearing, lancinating pain, extending through to the back, Chelidonium will cure it. The instant it relieves the patient says:
"Why, what a relief; the pain has gone."
The remedy has relieved that spasm, the little duct opens up and the stone passes out through the ductus communis choledochus. Every remedy that is indicated by the symptoms will cure gall stone colic.
A patient lying in bed, with great heat, extreme sensitiveness, cannot have the body touched, screaming with pains, red face and hot head, will gall stone colic, will be relieved in three minutes by Bell., but that is not at all like this remedy. Natrum sulph. and many other remedies have cured gall stone colic in a few minutes, when the symptoms agreed.
Now as to the pneumonia, it is generally of the right side, or right sided spreading to the left. The right- sidedness is marked, and but small portions of the left lung are involved. The pleura is generally involved, and so there are stitching, tearing pains.
One may not practice long before be will find a Chelidonium patient, sitting up in bed with high fever, bending forward upon his elbows, holding himself perfectly still, for this medicine has as much aggravation from motion as Bry. All of the pains are extremely aggravated from motion.
This patient is sitting with a pain that transfixes him; he cannot stir, he cannot move without - the pain shooting through him like a knife.
The next day you will see that his skin is growing yellow. If you see him in the beginning Chelidonium will relieve him and you will prevent that pneumonia. It is not uncommon in children, and it is extremely common in adults.
Do not get confused with Bryonia. Both are violently worse from motion. Bryonia wants to lie on the painful side, or wants to lie on the back if the pneumonia is mostly in the posterior part of the right lung. In Chelidonium he is worse from touch and motion.
Bell. has that extremely painful, tearing, rending, of the right lung with pleurisy, but in Bell., one cannot touch that right side, cannot press it, but must lie on the other side and he cannot move.
Cannot stand a jar of the bed, because of the extreme sensitiveness to motion: I mention all three in this particular way because they have some things in common, but the remedies are different.

Cicuta Virosa
This remedy is of interest because of its convulsive tendency. It puts the whole nervous system in such a state of increased irritability that pressure on a part causes convulsions. The convulsions extend from center to circumference; the head, face and eyes are first affected.
Convulsions: An aura in the stomach gives warning of the convulsion. Some complaints spread from the chest, especially from the heart; the rigors and chills begin in the chest; and there is a sensation of coldness about the heart; and from there it extends to other parts.
Convulsions often begin about the head and throat and extend downward. The whole body is in such a state of tension that, after excitement, a fire rages throughout the economy and causes convulsions. Any irritation in the throat or oesophagus will cause violent convulsions in this region.
On swallowing a fish bone, instead of only a pricking sensation as would occur in phlegmatic individuals, the irritation is so great that a spasm commences and spreads to other parts. It was the old remedy for tetanus and spasms caused by splinters in the skin or under the nails, competing with Bell. At the present day we find the most frequently indicated remedies for injuries to nerves are Led. and Hyper.
Catalepsy: A peculiar feature about some of the symptoms is that they resemble catalepsy. The cataleptic condition may be present or a condition very similar to it. He recollects nothing that took place or that he said during a certain period. He knows nobody, and lies without recognizing anyone, but when asked questions he answers correctly, and subsequently he has no recollection of what took place.
It is a cerebo-spinal irritant; the head is drawn back opisthotonos all the limbs are convulsed and rigid. It has cured traumatic tetanus lockjaw, epilepsy, epileptiform convulsions.
With severe pains in the bowels come convulsive movements and convulsions. if the stomach is disordered or chilled, or if he has fear or other mental conditions, convulsions come on. He is extremely sensitive to touch, and touch arid drafts bring on convulsions.
The convulsions spread from above downwards, and thus it is the opposite of Cuprum. The convulsions of Cupr. spread from the extremities to the centre; i. e., the little convulsions, merely cramps, are first felt in the fingers and then in the hands and later in the chest and whole body.
In Cicuta the little convulsions of the head, eyes and throat spread down the back to the extremities with violent contortions. The convulsions of Secale sometimes begin in the face.
At times he knows no one, but when touched and spoken to he answers correctly. Suddenly consciousness returns and he remembers nothing of what has occurred. He confuses the present with the past. He imagines himself a young child. Everything is confused and strange. He does not know where he is.
The faces of old friends look strange; he looks at them and wonders if they are the same persons he used to know. His house and familiar places look strange. Voices sound strange. The senses of sight and smell and all the other special senses are disturbed and confused. He is confused as to himself, his age and circumstances. A woman on coming out of the cataleptic attacks often takes on childish behavior.
A man thinks that he is a child and acts like one; silly laughter, playing with toys, and other acts of childish behavior. He feels as if he were in a strange place, and this causes fear. Thinks of the future with anxiety. Mental torpor; loss of ideas and sensation extending over a certain period. Memory a blank for hours or days with or without convulsions.
Convulsions generally take the place of the ecstatic or cataleptic condition. Natr. m. is somewhat similar to the mental condition of this remedy, as the Natr. m. patient goes about doing all her household work and other functions and next day knows nothing about it. Nux mos. is another remedy that has such a complete blank when going about doing things, a complete abstraction of mind.
Desires: This patient has strange desires; desires to eat coal and many other strange articles, because he is unable to distinguish between things edible and things unfit to be eaten; eats coal and raw potatoes.
Mind: Wants to be alone; dislike to society. Singing, shouting, dancing; likes toys, jumps about like a child. Lies in bed lamenting and wailing. Great agitation; child grasps at one's clothing in a frightened manner.
This is likely to occur before the convulsion, great horror in the, countenance, yet he has no recollection of the horror when be comes out of the convulsion. That state of anxiety and fear comes after the attack has begun, though the convulsions have not yet come on.
Between the convulsions the patient is mild, gentle, placid and yielding, which distinguishes it from Strych. and Nux v. convulsions. The Nux convulsions are all over the body and are worse from touch and draft, blueness and purple color of the body, but between the convulsions the patient is very irritable.
Of course, when they go out of one convulsion into another you cannot see this, but when out of the convulsion the Nux patient is very irritable. The Cicuta patient, out of the convulsion, is full of sadness, anxiety, and darkness, borrows trouble from the future, is affected by sad stories, is pessimistic.
He is afraid of society, afraid of company, and wants to be alone. He is suspicious and shuns people; despises others; over-estimation of himself. In this it approximates Plat. but there is no further resemblance between the two remedies.
Full of fear; fright will bring on convulsions, like Op., Ign., and Acon.
Vertigo: Full of vertigo. The whole sensorium is violently excited. Things turn around in a circle. Vertigo on walking, glassy eyes, etc. Complaints brought on from injuries to the skull, from blows on the head. Many times there is no trouble in the region of the injury; there may be compression and yet all the pains be in distant parts; drawing of the muscles and cramps.
Concussion of the brain and chronic injuries therefrom, especially spasms. Semi-lateral headaches forcing the patient to sit still erect.
Head: Headache as if the brain were loose on walking. When thinking of the exact nature of the pain it ceased. It has cured cerebro-spinal meningitis when there were convulsions and the convulsions were aggravated from touch, with fever and even spotted mottled skin. Mind and head symptoms after injuries. On going into a cerebro-spinal meningitis the patient sits in a chair talking as if nothing were wrong, when, quick as a flash, he passes into another state in which be knows no one; he falls over limp, he is put to bed, and though he answers questions he remains in a semi conscious state, knowing no one.
This may change into a spasm. The head is bent back in spasms; jerking back of the head; spasms begin in
the head and go downward. Violent shocks in the head, arms and legs. Head hot and extremities cold, like Bell. in its convulsions. Sweat on the scalp when sleeping. Child rolls head from side to side. Hot head.
Eyes: Convulsive action about the eyes; pupils dilated and insensible patient lies fixed in one place, with starting, fixed, glassy, upturned eyes, like Cupr.
Strabismus may be the only spasm the child is subject to from cerebral irritation. Every time the child is frightened it has strabismus; when touched or when it has cold, or after a fall biting the head, or coming periodically, it has strabismus.
Nose: The nose is sensitive to touch. Touch and jarring bring on complaints, and hence it was so useful in, and was the first remedy for, the result of injuries and irritability and over-sensibility.
It has troubles from shaving; it is useful in such eruptions as come in the whiskers; barber's itch; a solid crop of eruptions all over the face wherever the whiskers grow. Eruptions on the cheek like eczema. Swelling of the submaxillary glands. Erysipelatous eruptions.
It is closely related to Conium about the lips and lids, in that a small amount of pressure causes induration. It has cured epithelioma of the lips.
Throat: The throat troubles are mostly spasmodic. After swallowing a fish bone or stick which lodges in the throat a spasm comes on. After Cicuta the spasms will cease and it can be taken out. It is useful in cases of injury, accompanied with violent choking, so that be cannot allow an examination to be made.
Chest: Cold sensation in the chest. Spasms of the chest. Feels as if the heart stopped beating. Spasmodic symptoms of the back.
Opisthotonos. All conditions of the limbs are of a spasmodic character.
Cina
Cina is pre-eminently a child's remedy, but it is suitable for conditions in adults that are seldom thought of. A marked feature running through is touchiness, mental and physical.
Child: The child wants something, but does not know what. The child is aggravated by touch and even by being looked at, and is worse from seeing strangers. The skin is sensitive to touch. The scalp and back of the neck, the shoulders and arms are so sensitive, that it is almost a soreness as if bruised. The hyperesthesia is both mental and physical. The old routine of giving Cina for worms need not go into your notes, for if you are guided by symptoms the patient will be cured and the worms will go.
This patient is disturbed by everything, worse after eating even a moderate meal. The child takes a moderate supper and dreams all night, jerks and twitches in sleep, rouses up in a fright, talks excitedly about what he has dreamed, thinks it is real, and sees dogs, phantoms, and frightful things lie has dreamed about.
The dream is prolonged into the wakeful hours. Screams and trembles, with much anxiety on waking; whines and complains. While this little patient is aggravated by being handled yet he wants to be carried and kept busy, like Chamomilla; although not so intensely irritable as that remedy, yet he must be carried. At first on taking him out of the crib he screams when taken bold of; the first touch aggravates.
This aggravation from touch and sensitiveness runs through the convulsions and fevers, with delirium, glassy eyes, drawn mouth and white ring around the nose and mouth. With a disordered stomach he has convulsions after eating, with the head drawn back and glassy eyes.
The stomach is sour and the child is always spitting up sour milk and belching sour wind. The child smells sour.
The mother says that
"Baby has a worm breath," but the same odor is present when there are no worms. In the convulsions there are loss of consciousness and frothing at the mouth.
Hallucinations of smell, sight and taste, in the delirious state, after taking cold, or on waking from sleep; wakes up with the delusion. Things taste and smell differently. The senses of taste and touch are exaggerated or perverted.
In some cases of internal hydrocephalus, not with enlarged skull but with increase of the fluid in the ventricles and central canal of the spinal cord, the patients take on Cina symptoms. Rolling of the head frequent headaches; sensitiveness to jar; cannot be touched or tapped along the spinal cord without headache always worse in the sun - the head is hot and the feet are cold in the sun.
Cina will cure some of these cases. They cannot stand any kind of disturbance; it produces a convulsion. They cannot be punished because they go into convulsions. If the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum is closed they will be incurable, the internal pressure will go on and they will die from it. Such congenital states are incurable.
Dull headache with sensitiveness of the eyes. Headache before and after epileptic attacks and after intermittents. Before and during the headache sensitiveness of the skull. Cina children cannot have the hair combed, and the Cina woman must have her hair down in head and nerve complaints.
There is coldness of the, extremities and also some itching of the skin, but the head symptoms are predominant. From slight disturbances of the mind he cannot digest, and he has diarrhoea. The complaints are aggravated in summer; the heat affects the brain, arrests his functions, and on comes diarrhoea with green, slimy stools or white stools, and the child vomits.
It is pre-eminently brain in Cina; the orders are not received from the brain and so stomach symptoms develop, and worms hatch out. If he is cured the healthy gastric juice will chase the worms out
The child turns his head from side to side.
The pains are sometimes better from turning the head from side to side. You will see this in sensitive women, who must have their hair down; rolling the head relieves, not shaking as in the text, that is too violent.
Eyes: All sorts of colors before the eyes. Objects look yellow. It is useful in sensitive women, sensitive nervous women, who are always worse from using the eyes, and get pain in the head and eyes from sewing. It is like Ruta in that respect, symptoms of eye-strain. It is not so much indicated in young people but more when presbyopla is beginning in middle-aged women, and there is the effort to strain the eyes on fine work or print.
Rubs the eyes and can then see more clearly. On rising from the bed blackness before the eyes; different colors, especially yellow. Strabismus when worms are present, depending really on brain trouble because the worms are dependent upon that.
Face: Face sunken, pallid, wings of nose drawn in. Blue ring or gray streak around the mouth. "A sure sign of worms,” the mother says.
Child rubs its nose with the hands or on the pillow or on the nurse's, shoulder. Child bores into the nose until the blood come. The sickly aspect is striking, but it is representative of brain trouble, central trouble. The brain symptoms are the highest and most important. It frightened, whipped, or scolded, the brain is disturbed and the stomach disordered.
They get indigestion and breed worms; white or blue appearance about the mouth, grinding of the teeth during sleep. Before the child has teeth it has a chewing motion, a side to side movement. Sensitiveness of the teeth to the cold air and cold water.
Bleeding from the mouth, and nose. Inability to swallow liquids; they gurgle down the oesophagus before and after convulsions. When the head symptoms are present, the milk or water gurgles down the oesophagus with a gurgling cluck. This is present in diarrhoea and vomiting with brain symptoms.
Ars. and Cupr. are also prominent in gurgling down the oesophagus when swallowing. Choreic movements extend to the tongue.
The child or adult is not relieved by eating, is still hungry. The stomach is loaded and yet he is hungry. After vomiting you would expect there would be, an aversion to food, but there is in Cina, the same empty, hungry feeling.
When there is gnawing in the stomach after eating, or when the child has taken all it can hold yet cries for the bottle, or empties its stomach by spitting up and vomiting the food and then reaches out whining and crying for more, think of Cina. Shuddering when drinking wine as if it were vinegar.
Abdomen bard and bloated. Very often the Cina child will flop over on its belly and get to sleep in that way. If it is turned on the side it wakes up again. While in the mother's arms it will go to sleep with the abdomen resting on the mother's shoulder, but when she puts it on the side in bed it wakens.
If you had a child with copious, gushing, violently foetid stool, ameliorated by lying on the abdomen, and it would have another stool if lying any other way, Podoph. would be the remedy. That would not be Cina. The Cina stool is not very copious, and often white.
Gagging cough in the morning. Short, hacking cough at night. Spasmodic cough. Whooping cough.
Oversensitiveness to touch; trembling, spasms, chorea. Spasmodic yawning. Child cannot sleep unless on the belly or in constant motion.
Cinchona (China)
Now we shall take up the study of Cinchona, or China. Persons who have suffered much from neuralgias due to malarial influences, who have become anaemic and sickly from repeated haemorrhages, are likely to develop symptoms calling for China.
China produces a gradually increasing anaemia, with great pallor and weakness. It is sometimes- indicated in plethoric individuals, but this is the exception, and even in this class we find that the symptoms are tending towards the cachectic state, which is avoided by the prompt action of the remedy.
Throughout the body there is a gradually increasing sensitivity, a gradually increasing irritability of the nerves; the nerves are always in a fret, so that these people will say:
"Doctor, what is the matter with me, I am so nervous?"
Pains: Everywhere there are twinning, tearing, cutting pains in the limbs and over the body. And so great is the sensitiveness to touch that the nerves can many times be outlined; as, for instance, the little nerves in the fingers, because of their extreme sensitiveness.
The China patient grows increasingly sensitive to touch, to motion, to cold air, so that he is chilled from exposure. The pains are brought on by exposure to the wind, by cold air, and are increased by motion and touch.
Old malarial conditions that have been suppressed with quinine; gradually increasing pallor, bloodlessness, cachexia, until the patient is always catching cold, has liver troubles, bowel troubles, disordered stomach, is made miserable and sick by nearly everything he does.
He cannot eat fruit without having indigestion; he cannot eat sour things. He is debilitated, pale, waxy, suffers from pains, such as are found in quinine subjects, and breaks out into a perspiration up the least exertion.
This patient bleeds easily; bleeds from any orifice of the body from the nose, from the throat, from the uterus. And after hemorrhage complaints come on.
Running through the remedy as a general constitutional state is a tendency to congestion and often inflammation, in connection with hemorrhages. Inflammation of the part that bleeds or of distant parts. For instance, a woman aborts, has a haemorrhage, but with apparently no provocation, inflammation of the uterus or of the lungs sets in.
With these inflammations there is also great irritability of the tissues, tearing pains, cramping in the muscles and actual convulsions. When a China patient bleeds a little, for instance, in confinement, right in the midst of the bleeding convulsions come on. You would scarcely need to think of any other remedy.
Secale is the one other medicine that has this, but the two do not look alike. Secale wants the covers all off and the windows open, even in cold weather. It a draft of air blows on a China patient, while in labor, she may go into convulsions.
In the midst of labor the pains cease and convulsions come on. Another feature about this inflammation is its rapid progress and intensity, quickly going into gangrene. Inflammation after haemorrhage and the parts rapidly turn black.
China has a fullness of the veins. Not exactly a varicose condition, but a sort of paralysis of the coatings of the veins. The veins become full during fever.
All of these complaints are such as we find in broken down constitutions, in feeble, sensitive patients, especially in sensitive women. Sensitive to the odors of flowers, of cooking, of tobacco. Weak, relaxed, emaciated, pale, with feeble heart, feeble circulation and tendency to dropsy.
Dropsy runs through the remedy; anasarca and also dropsy of shut sacs. A peculiar thing about this dropsy is, that it comes after hemorrhage. In the anaemic condition; directly following the loss of blood, dropsy appears. This is the typical China patient.
Mucous membranes: Catarrhal condition of all mucous membranes. Gastro-duodenal catarrh, ending in jaundice. Old liver subjects with jaundice. They have lived for a long time under the influence of the malarial miasm. Feeble, sensitive, anemic. We see such cases in the South and Southwest, and long the Mississippi Valley.
Periodicity: is regarded as the most important indication for China, but it is a mistake. Periodicity is the symptom upon which Quinine is given. China has periodicity, but in no greater degree than many other remedies and is not so frequently indicated as routine prescribers suppose. Allopaths give Quinine whenever there is any periodicity in complaints. Still periodicity is a strong feature in this remedy. Pains come on with regularity at a given time each day. Intermittent fevers appear with regularity and run a regular course.
A part of this periodicity is an aggravation at night, and sometimes sharply at midnight. In colic that comes on regularly every night at 12 o'clock, and it may be, perhaps, a week before you, suspect it to be a China colic. A lady had colic and bloating of the abdomen every night at 12 o'clock.
After suffering many nights a single dose of China, prevented any further trouble. Haemorrhage from the nose coming on with regularity. Diarrhoea at night. Several gushing, black, watery stool; during the night; in the daytime, only after eating.
There is a general aggravation after eating. Remember that this is a chilly patient, sensitive to draft, sensitive to cold, whose complaints are brought on by being exposed to cold air; sensitive to touch, sensitive to motion. Extreme irritability of the tissues.
China is indicated in conditions following the loss of blood and other animal fluids; as, for instance, in those who are suffering from sexual excesses, from secret vice. They have become feeble, sleepless and irritable.
There is weakness and general coldness of the skin; twitching and jerking of the limbs; drawing and cramping in the muscles; chronic jerking; epileptiform convulsion; paralytic weakness; rush of blood to the head; ringing in the ears; darkness before the eyes; fainting on the slightest provocation.
Mind: Such is the China cachexia, and with this in view, the mental state will scarcely be a surprise to you. It is just such as you would expect in this nervous, sensitive patient. Weakness of mind. Inability to think or remember. Full of fear at night. Fear of animals, dogs, of creeping things. Wants to commit suicide, but lacks courage. Gradually the mind grows weaker, he uses wrong expressions or misplaces words.
Lies awake at night making plans, theorizing, building air castles, thinking of the wonderful things he is going to do some day. In the morning he wonders how he could have thought such foolish things.
After sleep his mind is clear and he looks more philosophically on the affairs of life. Unable to entertain any mental proposition that, means work. He dreads work. He is apathetic, indifferent, low spirited, silent, disinclined to think. He is unable to control the mind, to make it do what he wants it to do. You see it is not as yet a real insanity.
This state of mind comes on after haemorrhage. Insomnia after haemorrhage. A woman, after having suffered great loss of blood, will be sleepless night after night.
After hemorrhage we may have dizziness. it is a natural consequence; dizziness and fainting. But ordinarily, after the proper diet for a few days, these symptoms will have disappeared. With the China patient they go from bad to worse. The woman after severe haemorrhage does not make blood. There is mal-assimilation, and the vertigo persists for days and weeks. China will restore order.
Head: The remedy is full of headaches. Congestive headaches in broken down constitutions. Extremities cold and body covered with a cold sweat. Rending, tearing pains. Pressing and throbbing. As soon as the air strikes the head those pains come on.
Headache better in a warm room; worse from touch; worse from motion; worse from cold. These are the principal features. A slight touch will aggravate the disturbance. But notice the exception. Hard pressure ameliorates the China pains, as light pressure aggravates.
Sensitiveness of the tissues; sensitiveness along the course of the nerves; the pains are brought on by touch, by cold air. Stitches in the head with pulsation in temples, which can be felt with the fingers; ameliorated by hard pressure, but aggravated by touch.
The jar and motion of walking hurt the head. Even turning over in bed aggravates. Cannot ride in a carriage or anything that jolts. Ameliorated by hard pressure. Throbbing headaches, aggravated by a draft of air, in the open air, from the slightest touch; ameliorated by hard- pressure. The scalp feels as if the hair was grasped roughly. It is sensitive to touch. Profuse sweating of the scalp. Headaches aggravated at night. Headaches from sexual excesses; loss of animal fluids.
Eyes: Now we come to the eye. Photophobia. Yellowness of the sclera, Exposure to cold wind will bring on neuralgia; ameliorated from keeping quiet and from keeping warm.
"Nocturnal blindness, dimness of vision.
Feeling as if sand were in the eyes.
Pains worse from light.
Better in the dark."
Ears: In the ear and the nose you find the same sensitiveness as in eyes every little noise is painful. Ringing; roaring, buzzing, and singing, chirping like crickets in the ears. Dry catarrh of the middle ear. Hardness of hearing is not infrequently the result of this condition.
It gradually increases until there is total deafness, and the noises in the ear continue long after the patient has lost the ability to distinguish articulate sounds. Haemorrhage from the ear. Offensive, bloody, purulent discharges.
Nose: Frequent nosebleed in anemic patients. Here, again, the dryness and catarrhal conditions. Dry
coryza; or fluent coryza, suppressed and causing violent head pains. Odors nauseate. Sensitiveness to the odors of flowers, cooking, tobacco.
Face:The face is withered, shrunken, sallow, anaemic, sickly. Red when the fever is on and sometimes when the chill is on, but in the apyrexia pale, sickly and sallow. Neuralgia of the face; tearing, rending, knifelike pains with the usual modalities.
The veins of the face are distended. This is frequently observed during the fever and sweat of the China intermittents.
Teeth: The teeth get loose, the gums swell. The teeth are painful while chewing; they feel too long. Toothache with every little cold.
Rending as if teeth were being pulled out, every time the child nurses at the breast. Exudations about the teeth and gums. Black, and foetid great putridity in the lower forms of fever.
Taste: The taste is extremely acute. Exaggerated so that nothing tastes natural. "Bitter taste in the mouth.
Food tastes bitter or too salty.
Burning as from pepper on tip of the tongue.
Dryness in the mouth and throat.
Difficult swallowing."
Sometimes there is canine hunger, but one of the most common features is loathing of everything; aversion to all food. The China patient is often passive in regard to eating.
Sits down to eat and the food tastes fairly good and he fills up. But it does not matter much whether he eats or not.
"Loathing and violent hunger."
"Hunger and yet want of appetite.
Indifference to eating and drinking.
Only while eating some appetite and natural taste for food return. Loss of appetite.
Aversion to all food.
Aversion to bread."
His appetite varies. Thirst is peculiar. The patient will say:
"I know my chill is coming on now because I have thirst."
Thirst: before the chill, but as soon as the chill comes on there is no thirst. But when he begins to warm up he begins to get thirsty; that I during the period in which the two lap he is thirsty, but when the chill has fairly subsided and the heat is upon him his thirst subsides also and he only wants to wet his mouth.
But as the hot spell begins to subside he increases the amount taken, and all through the sweat he can hardly get water enough.
Thirst before and after the chill and thirst during the sweat. No thirst during the chill. No thirst during the hot spell. You will cure more cases of intermittent fever with Ipecac and Nux vomica, than with China. China has well-defined chill, fever and sweat.
Stomach: Gastric symptoms from eating fish, fruit, and from drinking wine. Flatulent distension almost to bursting. There are constant eructations, loud and strong, and yet no relief, so extensive is the flatulence. In Carbo veg. after belching a little, there is relief. Lyc. has both.
Tympanitic distension of the abdomen and stomach in low forms of fever. Cannot move on account of soreness in the bowels. Vomiting of blood. Sometimes followed by dropsy of the extremities.
"Hiccough.
Nausea.
Vomiting.
Eructations, tasting of food, or they are bitter, sour. Frequent vomiting.
Vomiting of sour mucus, bile, blood."
Likely to occur at night. Pulsation in the stomach and rumbling. Cold feeling in the stomach. Fermentation after eating fruit. Acidity. Disorders of the stomach after milk.
Diarrhea: Copious, watery black discharges from the bowels. Gurgling and rumbling in the abdomen. Stool immediately after eating and at night. Great quantities of flatus expelled from the bowels. Diarrhea comes on gradually. Stools more and more watery. Chronic diarrhoea, with emaciation and aggravation at night. Petroleum has a chronic diarrhoea, but only in the daytime.
Genitals: Of the male genital organs the most striking feature is weakness, Of the female genital organs there is a different class of conditions. In the woman who has been subject to uterine haemorrhages you may look out at any moment for a sudden, sharp attack of inflammation of the ovaries.
Hemorrhage from the uterus. Prolapse. Menses, too early and too profuse; black, clotted blood; menstrual colic; metrorrhagia.
Pains and convulsions; convulsions come on in the midst of the haemorrhage; cramps in the uterus along with haemorrhage; labor-like pains; ringing in the ears; loss of sight; sliding down in bed. In confinement
the lochia is profuse and lasts too long. Deterioration of health from prolonged lactation; toothache; neuralgia of the face.
Respiration: Difficult respiration, rattling and filling up of the chest with mucus asthma. "Pressure in the chest, as from violent rush of blood; violent palpitation, bloody sputa, sudden prostration."
Dry, suffocative cough at night; profuse night sweats. Pains in the chest, increasing sensitiveness to cold, heat and redness of the face with cold hands.
Along the spine there are sore spots. Tearing, darting pains in the limbs, ameliorated by heat and hard pressure, brought on by touch, by becoming chilled. Worse at night.
"Knees weak, especially when walking."
China cures low, forms of fever, remittent or intermittent, typhoid or malarial.

The symptoms are worse at night from warmth of the bed, and when perspiring, like Mercurius. Worse from both heat and cold,
Catarrhal inflammation. Fig warts (Thuja). Ulcers. Many complaints from eating. Syphilis in all stages. Suppurating glands; chancres. It is best to study this remedy as a form of Mercurius, which has a few cunning phases of its own. It is a deep acting remedy in sycosis

Cistus Canadensis
(see too Salts of Mercurius)
This remedy is an antipsoric, a deep-acting remedy. It runs very close to Calcarea, but is milder in its action. It has the same exhaustion from exertion, dyspnoea, sweating and coldness that we find in Calcarea.
What will forcibly call your attention to a remedy will be the curing of a bad and typical case. I remember the first time my attention was decidedly called to Cistus.
I had put it on my list to study from time to time and had come to the conclusion that it was only a side issue, until a young lady of nineteen years of age fell under my observation.
Glands: The glands of the neck were large and hard, the parotids especially; she had foetid otorrhoea; her eyes were inflamed and suppurating; there were fissures at the corners of the eyes; her lips were cracked and bleeding, and she had salt rheum at the ends of the fingers.
I could not make Calcarea fit the patient, but after much study this little remedy seemed to be just what I needed; and although she had had an immense amount of Homoeopathy, good and bad, this remedy cured.
The glands inflame, become swollen and suppurate. It causes cries and cures old ulcers. It has a scrofulous constitution. It is useful in chronic diarrhea, with enlarged glands, even in those who are flabby, sickly and pallid and who cannot go upstairs without losing, their breath.
Mucous membranes: All the mucous membranes throw out a thick, yellowish, offensive mucus and hence it is suitable in old and troublesome catarrh. The chest fills up with mucus and he feels relieved after expectoration, but after he empties the chest it feels raw.
It has eruptions, herpes, tetter, scaly eruptions, salt rheum on the hands and ends of the fingers, with cracking and bleeding of the fingers in winter and from washing in cold water.
All its complaints are worse from mental exertion. He is excitable. His cough, headache and pains are worse from mental exertion. Pains shoot from the head to the ear. Shooting, stitching, tearing pains in inflamed parts. Red discharges from the ear date back to eruptive diseases.
Headache: He feels as if paralyzed after mental exertion, and mental excitement increases his sufferings, like Calcarea and Borax. If he is compelled to fast headache comes on, and like Lyc., the headache will be relieved after eating.
Frontal headache with coldness. In a warm room the perspiration comes out, and it is cold, and the more he sweats the colder he gets. Pain in the forehead with cold sweat, and the colder he gets the worse the pain becomes.
Sick headaches and great prostration with the headache. Sensation of internal coldness of the forehead, especially in warm room. Pressing pain at the root of die nose with headache. The parotid gland is so much enlarged that it pushes the head to one side.
The glands of the abdomen swell with chronic diarrhea, and the swelling may be tuberculous. Enlarged glands, with or without eruptions.
Skin: All over the body there is a sensation of crawling; formication tingling and creeping like ants, and no eruption. He scratches till the skin is raw trying to get relieved of the itching and prickling. Eruption upon the face; eczema. Eruptions about the ear.
Cold feeling or burning in the nose, This is difficult to distinguish. In acute coryza the nose fills up with thick, yellow mucus, and when this is blown out it leaves the nasal cavity empty, and there is irritation; one will say it is a rawness, another will say a coldness, and another will describe it as a burning.
Nose: There is relief when the nose fills up again with mucus. In Ars. the mucus in the nose is so acrid that it burns, but in Ant. c., Aesculus, and in this remedy when the nose is empty there is a burning or rawness. The sensation of rawness, coldness or burning is caused by the inhalation of air.
An epidemic of coryza was prevalent, and this was the strongest symptom, the pain caused by inhaling air, great burning from inhaled air. But it is not in the acute coryza that we see the value of this remedy, it is in the old, chronic case, with thick discharge, and a cold feeling or burning in the nose when inhaling air.
"Sharp shooting, intolerable itching and thick crusts, with burning on right zygoma."
Face: This remedy has cured lupus on the face. Caries of the lower jaw. Open, bleeding cancer on the lower lip. Lupus exedens. Pain in all the joints of the face. It cures old, deep-seated, eating ulcers about the ankle and shin, with copious acrid discharge, formication and swollen glands, aggravation from bathing, extreme sensitiveness to the open air, only comfortable when very warm.
The teeth have all sorts of disturbances; the gums settle away, the teeth become loose; scorbutic gums. The same cold feeling is described in the throat as in the nose-smarting and coldness. Mouth and throat full of mucus. The throat feels rough, as if full of sand. Dry spots in the throat. The throat looks glossy, shining as if vanished, in old atrophic catarrhs.
Every cold settles in the throat. Hot air feels good everywhere. In old cases there is trouble with scrofulous glands, which are enlarged, and the patient wants the heat; goes to the register and turns the heat on, wants to feel the heat in the nose, throat and lungs.
Patients going into tuberculosis have that desire for beat; chilly persons, They do not feel cold to touch, but they are cold subjectively, chilly. Hawking of gum-like mucus, especially in the morning, fauces inflamed and dry. Suppuration of the glands of the throat.
These patients crave pungent things, and especially want something to warm them up, something to build them up, something stimulating herring, cheese; something strong.
"Chronic induration and inflammation of the mammae. Left mamma inflamed, suppurating, with a feeling of fullness in the chest. Sensibility to cold air,"
with inflamed glands. We see its tendency to produce enlargement of the glands, and this would make us think of it in growths with involvement of the glands all around. The glands of the neck are enlarged in lines, like knotted rope, as in Hodgkin’s disease.
Only a limited number of remedies have this knotting. Itching of the skin and mucous membrane. The itching in the ear is not relieved by scratching, and the part is raw from the constant rubbing and scratching. The eyes constantly itch. In the throat there is continuous itching. In the chest there is a constant tickling, causing cough. At the anus and all other orifices there is itching, and the itching parts are rubbed until raw and bleeding.
Scrofula; swelling and suppuration of the glands of the neck. Eruption on the back like shingles. Scrofulous ulcer on the back. Burning, bruised pain in the coccyx, worse from touch.
That is like Carbo an., in which the coccyx burns when pressed on, especially after a slight injury in a nervous woman.
Tetter on the hands; blisters oozing after scratching. Diseases of the nails. Hard, thickened places on the hands of workmen, with deep cracks.
The febrile symptoms have not been sufficiently brought out. In chronic cases there is copious sweat with exhaustion. Night-sweats.
Clematis Erecta
Clematis has only been partially proved, and consequently it applies only to a few conditions, but these are very important, so that it cannot be passed over.
Skin: It has vesicular eruptions almost erysipelatous in character. One almost constant mental state is that he fears to be alone, yet dreads company. fie dreads the necessity of having company, and it seems that the atmosphere is full of frightful and distressing things to worry him.
This makes him low-spirited. The remedy seems to fit the sycotic constitution in its mental state and its generals.
It seems to be fitted to those who had gonorrhoea recently suppressed, because after that suppression will come on this mental state with inflammation of glands.
It is rather singular about the eruptions. One would not think that from so harmless a little shrub so much trouble would come; but there are persons who are just as sensitive to this vine as to Rhus and it resembles Rhus to a great extent in its manifestations.
It produces just, as poisonous a condition as Rhus. Here I might speak of several remedies which relate to the Rhus poison.
There are many vesicular remedies that look like Rhus, and all of them you will have to use more or less in their antidotal relations to each other, but it is well to be sure in a given case which one of them produced the poison.
Croton tig., Rhus, Ranunculus, Anacardium and Clematis at times look so much alike that I am unable to tell them apart by their eruptions.
They are all similar enough to each other to become universal antidotes. The others are all deeper acting than Rhus. The Ranunculus, the little buttercup, has cured epithelioma of the lids. It has cured cancerous affections, so we say it goes deep into the tissues.
On the outer head we have a part of the manifestations of Clematis vesicular eruptions with great itching, stinging and crawling. Now what is true of the eruption here will be true of the Clematis eruption everywhere. It is aggravated from washing.
It will smart and burn, and a quasi-inflammation will set in from washing. Contrast this with the internal features of the remedy. In the teeth and jaws the pain is violent, but while the eruption is made worse from cold applications, the pain inside the jaw and the teeth is relieved by cold water held in the mouth, and aggravated violently from heat, and from the warmth of the bed.
The eruption is aggravated from the warmth of the bed, and also from cold washing. We have to go into the details a little to see whether an eruption is Rhus or whether it is Clematis, or something else. Vesicular eruptions filling with yellow fluid and with induration under the vesicles.
It produces eruptions very closely related to herpes and eczema, and they spread. About the eyes we have vesicular eruptions. If seen in one stage it will be vesicular, and if later, it will be seen as an ulceration. Simple and graver forms of herpes. Herpes zoster about the body.
"Burning, and smarting of the eyes; worse from closing them.
Inflammation of the iris.
Eyes inflamed, protruded, dim.
Chronic irritation of the lids."
Teeth: The pains in connection with the teeth are aggravated from the warmth of the bed, which is general; they come at night, are aggravated from warm things held in the mouth and ameliorated from holding cold water in the mouth.
Stitching and drawing pains in the teeth; worse at night; better for a short time from holding cold water in the mouth; better from drawing in cold air; worse from the warmth of the bed. The toothache is tolerable during the day, but as soon as he lies down in bed and assumes a horizontal position it increases to an intolerable degree. Pain in hollow tooth, better by cold water or drawing in cold air.
Glands: Swelling of the glands of the groin is a striking feature even when connected with scirrhus. It is connected also with suppressed gonorrhea, and with rheumatism of the joints. Pain and swelling of the right spermatic cord; this is worse at night, worse from walking and from the warmth of the bed.
Bladder: While it has both sides, strange to say there is more trouble in the glands that are on the right side of the body than on the left. It has produced much trouble in the bladder. Constant urging to urinate, most painful tenesmus. Flow stopping and starting. The urethra is painful to pressure. Micturition is remarkably slow, only a feeble stream because of the smallness of the urethra.
It is the nature of this remedy to infiltrate and inflame tissues, and, hence it is useful in those cases of gonorrhoea where they have been slow in passing away, where they have been treated by injection.
That slow inflammation of the urethra will infiltrate and the urethra feels like a large whip-cord, painful upon pressure, and this goes on until the canal is almost closed. You will be surprised to find, when Clematis is indicated, that after giving that remedy the discharge is re-established, and soon the old stricture goes away. At the end of two or three months he feels nothing of it.
A striking feature in connection with the urine, bladder, etc., is that the patient cannot quite empty the bladder. He always feels as if there was a little more, and when he appears to have finished it will keep dribbling away. This is a common feature of stricture.
"Inability to evacuate all the urine at once.
When beginning to urinate it burns the worst, while urinating it sticks in urethra, and after urinating it still continues to burn.
Discharge from the urethra of thick pus."
It is seldom indicated in the very first stage of gonorrhoea during the highest inflammation, but in those cases that are inclined to hang on. Then come the sequelae if gonorrhea be suppressed. Inflammation of the testes is common, and this is one of the medicines suitable.
Strange to say, the right side of the body is more commonly affected than the left. Intermittent flow of the urine. Urine stops and starts with the chordee still present. The right spermatic cord is very sensitive. Pain in the testes, drawing. Painful, inflamed and swollen testes. Orchitis with much painful swelling and hardness. Now when the swelling has gone down-perhaps you gave Puls., which was the remedy for the time, but it did not finish the case, there is induration of this portion. Swelling of the right half of the scrotum with thickening and banging low down.
Women: Provings have not been made very much in women, which is to be regretted, because it would be well to know if this remedy affects the ovaries as it does the testes. It has been clinically used, and has cured many troubles in women, especially inflammation in the mammary gland.
"Ulceration and hardness of glands.
Scirrhus of the breast with induration and ulceration.
Scirrhus of the left mamma with stitches in the shoulder;"
this is a clinical symptom, "worse in the night."
She cannot bear to be uncovered.
It has rheumatic conditions of the limbs from suppressed gonorrhea. Great nervous weakness and twitchings of the muscles. It has pain on lying down and preparatory to going to sleep. An electric shock; twitching, jerking, as if a faradic battery had been turned on. It has also a general febrile condition, but nothing very striking.
Vesicular eruptions on the body. Herpetic eruptions here and there it has a herpetic constitution.
"Eruption of vesicles and pustules from the former exuded a clear, watery secretion, from the latter a purulent fluid."
Yellow vesicles and yellow pustules. Both are common to this remedy. "Dark, burning eruptions with violent itching."
Herpes that ulcerate. Ichorous, spreading ulcers.
Cocculus Indicus
We will study the general system and The mind as usual. Cocculus slows down all the activities of the body and mind, producing a sort of paralytic weakness. Behind time in all its actions.
Slowly: All the nervous impressions are slow in reaching the centres. If you pinch this patient on the great toe he wants a minute and then says "oh," instead of doing it at once. In response to questions he answers slowly, after apparent meditation, but it is an effort to meditate.
And so with all nervous manifestations, thought, muscular activity, etc. He cannot endure any muscular exertion, because he is weak; he is tired. First comes this slowness, then a sort of visible paralytic condition, and then complete paralysis. This may be local or general. There are certain causes which produce these effects. A wife nursing her husband, a daughter nursing her father, becomes worn out by the anxiety, worry and loss of sleep.
She is exhausted; unable to sustain any mental or physical effort; weak in the knees, weak in the back, and when the times comes for her to sleep she cannot sleep. Sickness brought about in this manner is analogous to that caused by the Cocculus poison, and hence Cocculus from the time of Hahnemann to the present time has been a remedy for complaints from nursing, not exactly complaints that come on in the professional nurse, for Cocculus needs the combination of vexation, anxiety and prolonged loss of sleep, such as you have in the mother or daughter who is nursing, or the nurse when she takes on the anxiety felt by a member of the family; a wife nursing her husband through typhoid, or other long spell of sickness.
At the end of it she is prostrated in body and mind, she cannot sleep, she has congestive headaches, nausea, vomiting and vertigo. That shows how a Cocculus case begins. One who is thus exhausted in body and mind goes out for a ride. She gets sick headache, pain in the back, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. She gets into the car to take a journey. Sick headache comes on. She goes on a mile or two and will have nausea, vomiting and sick headache. She feels weak all over, feels as if she would sink away.
The Cocculus patient gets into a wagon to ride, sick headache, nausea, vertigo come on. The Cocculus patient cannot endure motion. Aggravated by talking, by motion, by the motion of the eyes, by riding. Wants plenty of time to turn the head cautiously to see things. Wants plenty of time to move, to think, to do everything. The whole economy is slowed down, inactive.
Tremulous, tired, excitable. The hands tremble when taking hold of anything, or he takes hold of awkwardly and drops it. Incoordination runs through this remedy, and hence it has been used with good effect in locomotor ataxia. It has staggering and numbness. Numbness is quite a feature of this remedy. Numbness of the lower extremities, in the fingers, in the shoulder, of the side of the face. Complaints from anxiety.
Mind: Extreme irritability of the nervous system. The least noise or jar is unbearable. You have heard that Bell. is worse from a jar. So is Cocculus, and quite like Bell. Cocculus is also like Belladonna in its sleeplessness, and other general conditions.
This sensation of seasickness and dizziness is sometimes felt all over the body; a sort of faint feeling which is followed sometimes by loss of consciousness, or a paralytic rigidity.
Joints: Stiffness of the joints is a common feature in Cocculus. It belongs to the limbs in general. But it is such a strong symptom I will mention it here. Limbs straightened out and held there for a while are painful when flexed. Persons who have been suffering from anxiety, prostrated, will lie on the back, straighten out the limbs, and get up only with great difficulty.
The doctor comes and he discovers what is the matter. He bends the limbs and she screams, but she is relieved after the bending, and then she can get up and move about.
You cannot find that anywhere else. It is entirely without inflammation. It is a sort of a paralytic stiffness, a paralysis of the tired body and mind. The Cocculus headaches and backaches, pains and distress are present.
A man will stretch out his leg on a chair and be cannot flex it until he reaches down with his hands to assist. Such things are strange. Faintness on moving the body, fainting from pain in the bowels, from colic. With all this slowing down of the thoughts and activities the patient remains extremely sensitive to suffering, sensitive to pain.
Spasms through the body like electric shocks, convulsions after loss of sleep. This patient goes on with nervousness and excitement, anxiety and loss of sleep until convulsions supervene. Tetanus. Cholera, attacks of paralytic weakness with pain, paralysis of the face, of the eyes, paralysis of the muscles everywhere, paralysis of the limbs. Even diphtheria has been known to induce a state very much like I have described as due to loss of sleep and anxiety.
I remember a case of paralysis of the lower extremities that was prescribed for by a very careful homeopathic physician many years ago. It was one of the things that surprised me in the early days of my prescribing and observation.
It was the case of a little girl with paralysis of lower extremities after diphtheria and no hope was given. But Doctor Moore (he was then an Octogenarian) looked over the case. I was acquainted with the family and with the doctor.
He studied the case carefully and gave Cocculus c.m. It was not many days before the child began to move the legs, and the condition was perfectly cleared up, and I have never ceased to wonder at it. It was a good prescription perfectly in accord with all the elements of the case.
Doctor Moore was one of the pupils of Lippe and Hering.
You can hardly see what is coming when the mental activities are slowed down, from anxiety, and loss of sleep, such as we have in nursing. The mind appears like approaching imbecility, and as you look upon the true Cocculus case you wonder if that patient has not been growing insane for a year or two, because the mind seems almost a blank. He looks into space and slowly turning the eyes toward the questioner answers with difficulty. It occurs in nervous prostration, in typhoid fever. It is so nearly like Phos. Acid., that the two remedies must be carefully individualized. Time passes quickly.
He cannot realize that it has been a whole night. A week has gone by, and it seems but a moment, he is so dazed. Slowness of comprehension; cannot find the right word to express his thoughts, so slowly does his mind work; what has passed he cannot remember; forgets what he has just read; cannot talk; cannot bear the least noise; cannot bear the least contraction.
The tongue will not respond. There is confusion of mind and difficulty of articulation. An idea comes into his mind and becomes fixed. He cannot convert it or move it, but it just stays there, and if he speaks he will say something that will cause you to realize that that same idea is holding on to him. So he appears to be in a state of imbecility.
Vertigo: Mental derangement with vertigo. With most all the mental symptoms there is vertigo. He lies in a state of apparent unconsciousness, yet knows all that is going on and at times is even able to remember and describe what was going on, but does not even wink; does not move a muscle.
There is an appearance of ecstacy, a smile upon the face. Knows what is going on, yet with complete relaxation of the muscles without speech or apparent recognition of anyone. Perfectly relaxed, and yet knowing what is going on. That resembles catatonia. Unable to think.
Fears death. Feels as if some awful thing was about to happen. All this is the result of grief, anxiety, vexation, prolonged loss of sleep.
The vertigo is visually attended with nausea. A Cocculus case cannot look out of the car window, cannot look down from the boat and see water moving, without nausea immediately.
Perhaps you can even now surmise what the head symptoms are to be. With the headaches comes dizziness, extreme nausea and gastric symptoms.
Headaches brought on from riding in a wagon or riding in the cars or on shipboard; headache from motion. Cannot accommodate the eyes to moving objects; dizziness and whirling and headache.
Congestion of the head, pressing, throbbing headache. Headache as if the skull would burst, or like a great valve opening and shutting. Sick headache with vertigo. Headache again from working in the sun. Sick headache from riding in a carriage.
Eyes: Dim sightedness and disturbance of vision. Paralytic weakness of the muscles of the eyes, as well as the muscles of accommodation. The face becomes pale and sickly. Pale as death, with pains in the face, vertigo and nausea.
Tearing pains in the face. Neuralgia of the face.
Face bloated. Quivering and twitching of the muscles of the face. Paralysis of the muscles of the face. Numbness of the face. Twitching, jerking, numbness, paralysis, tearing pains.
Prostration and nervous exhaustion accompany most of the complaints of Cocculus.
Stomach symptoms. Loathing of food. Metallic taste in the mouth. Bitter taste in the mouth. Sour, nauseous taste in the mouth, and no food tempts him. He lies there sick with a little fever or a "cold."
Headache, vertigo, nausea, loathing. Intermittent fevers with pains in the limbs, especially in the knees and bones of the legs, with that peculiar stiffness, nausea, and loathing of food. In intermittent fever or perhaps a low typhoid state, we have this loathing of food with nausea.
You go to the bedside and you ask the nurse, "What have you been feeding the patient?” and the patient gags. The thought of food makes the patient gag.
The nurse will say that every time she mentions food the patient gags. The thought of food or the smell of food in the other room, or in the kitchen, will nauseate the patient. Two medicines have this: Cocculus and Colchicum.
Paralysis: Paralytic conditions. Paralysis of the oesophagus. Cannot swallow. "Paralytic condition of the throat after diphtheria.”
Sore throat with low forms of fever. The fever is gone but the patient does not rally, there is much nervous trembling, numbness, twitching of muscles and great weakness. Sensation as though a worm were crawling in the stomach.
Spasms of the stomach. Violent attacks of gastralgia, violent cramp of the stomach. Griping, pinching, constrictive pain. The pain in the bowels feels as if the intestines were pinched between sharp. stones.
This causes fainting and vomiting. Colicky pains in the bowels great distension of the abdomen, such as is found in typhoid fever tension of the abdomen after drinking; flatulent colic.
Tearing, cutting, spasmodic pains in the bowels. Radiating pains in the bowels accompanying diarrhea. A paralytic condition of the rectum. Inability to press at stool. Urging to stool and burning in rectum. Disposition to stool, but peristaltic motion in upper intestines is wanting.
Women: Copious menstrual flow, menses too soon; last too long. Catamenia two weeks before the time. In women prostrated from grief and from anxiety, and from prolonged loss of sleep, menses come too soon, are copious and prolonged.
Headache, vertigo, nausea. Violent, cramping pains in the bowels, clutching pains in the uterus during menstruation. Again, just such a patient as described will have a suppression of the menstrual flow, or for weeks and months will have no menstrual flow; or just at the time the menstrual period should come on there is a copious leucorrhea that takes the place of the menses.
The woman is emaciated, and grows more and more sickly and chlorotic. The face is of greenish, yellow, sallow hue.
"Leucorrhea in place of the menses,” or "copious leucorrhea between the menstrual periods."
The heart is weak, pulse feeble. Paralytic weakness in the limbs, numbness, jerking of the muscles, twitching, quivering, loss of sensation, loss of power, muscular weakness in all the limbs. Numbness and paralytic feeling in the limbs.
Awkwardness of the fingers and hands. On attempting to grasp the one band with the other there is migratory numbness, or a more permanent numbness associated with paralytic weakness, sometimes changeable; sometimes one side is numb and the other paralyzed.
The soles of the feet go to sleep. Numbness of the soles of the feet, such as we have in locomotor ataxia; cold feet. The knees give way from weakness. Totters while walking and threatens to fall to one side. Knees stiff. Paralysis of the lower extremities, proceeding from the small of the back. Arising from cold, from the abuse of Mercury.
Paralysis of the lower limbs, with stiffness, numbness and bruised feeling.
Sleeplessness from long nursing and from night watching; that is a symptom that I have called your attention to so often. Anxious, frightful dreams; ill effects from loss of sleep and night watching.
"Slightest loss of sleep tells on him."
Coccus Cacti
There is a little remedy and will be a relief after the study of so many difficult ones. With fuller proving it will doubtless show itself a deep-acting constitutional remedy.
Although it has cured some deep-seated chronic troubles, it has been used chiefly in acute affections. This is only because of the scantiness of its provings and our lack of knowledge concerning it in a general way.
Very few mental symptoms have been brought out. Its use, so far as demonstrated, is mostly in catarrhal conditions of the air passages, and whooping cough, with copious, ropy, jelly-like mucus.
Great quantities of this mucus form in the nose, in the throat, in the air passages generally, and in the vagina. The routine practitioner, whenever be sees thick, ropy, gelatinous mucus, thinks only of Kali bi.
That comes from the study of key-notes. But it must be remembered that other remedies besides Kali bi. have this.
Cough: Spasmodic cough; whooping cough; the cough of drunkards. The chronic catarrhal state of the Coccus cacti patient comes on especially in the winter. It comes on when the cold weather begins and lasts till the warm weather comes.
The patient is cold, and his complaints come on in cold weather. He is sensitive to cold, easily takes cold. But you must distinguish between the patient himself and his complaints, because they are entirely opposite to each other.
When he once becomes sick from exposure to cold, he is always worse in a warm room and better in the cold air. His cough is brought on in a warm room; from being too warm in bed; from drinking warm things. It is better from drinking cold things in a cold room; worse from exertion; from getting heated up; from becoming warm; that is, after the complaint has once set in, it reverses itself.
This is not unlike many other remedies. I have received many letters from doctors, saying:
"Why is it that in your repertory and in Boenninghausen's, certain remedies are put down as better from cold and worse from cold?
They certainly cannot have both."
But they do have both, sometimes under different conditions and sometimes under the same conditions. Sometimes these are primary, sometimes they are secondary symptoms. A remedy must be examined to ascertain how it is that these circumstances can be the very opposite of each other.
But commonly Boenninghausen registers both those things that belong to particulars and those things that belong to generals, and if the symptom, in his judgment, is strikingly worse by a certain circumstance, even if it is the very opposite of the general, he had that symptom in boldfaced type. Phos. is a good illustration of what we have been talking about.
If you make a careful study of Phos. you will see that the complaints of the chest are all worse from cold, from cold air and from being cold. He catches cold and it settles in the chest, and the cough and irritation in the chest are worse from cold and being exposed to cold air.
But he wants cold things in the stomach. His stomach feels better from cold things. Let him have head trouble and his head is better from cold, he wants cold things in his stomach. If he has stomach trouble, it is made worse by anything hot; he wants cold water to, drink, and as soon as it gets warm, he vomits it up. You see Phos. is worse from cold and worse from heat. The pains in the extremities are better from heat.
The chronic cough, as has been said, is likely to begin with cold weather and last all winter, with a copious formation of mucus in the chest. It is a spasmodic cough, forcing the patient into the most violent efforts. The face becomes purple. Finally he retches and vomits long strings of tough, ropy mucus filling the mouth and throat and causing him to choke.
This is due to the fact that the mucus is so tenacious that it cannot be ejected from the pharynx in the usual way, therefore he must vomit. Now, there is a striking feature of this remedy. Anything coming in contact with the pharynx, the inside of the mouth, or even the gums, produces gagging and retching and will bring on the cough.
Chest: We find this in the chronic states of sensitive persons, who are unable to brush the teeth or rinse the mouth without gagging and sometimes vomiting.
There is a general hyperesthesia of the skin and mucous membranes. Sensitive to the pressure of the clothing.
With the chest troubles there is much dyspnoea. He cannot walk without bringing on difficult breathing. He cannot ascend a height without suffocation. After the quantities of mucus are cleared out the cough is better and he goes on for two, three or four hours, when another one of these awful attacks comes on.
They are apt to be worse at night when he becomes warm in bed. If he can lie in a cool room without much covering he will go longer without coughing.
The whooping cough is of a similar character. You will see the child lying in bed with the covers off. It wants the room cold, and the mother will tell you that if she can get to it quickly enough with a drink of cold water she can ward off the paroxysm.
The chest fills up with mucus until respiration cannot be carried on any longer and it must be cleared out, yet the child will resist and hold its breath to prevent coughing. You will be astonished to see how speedily Coccus cacti will change the character of that cough.
One of the earliest signs of improvement will be observed in the easier respiration. The cough becomes less violent, the retching passes away, and in a week or ten, days the cough will go, too. Cough worse after eating, worse on waking, worse in a warm room.
In the early stages of whooping cough Carbo veg. will develop and. bring out the symptoms and furnish a good picture for a second prescription, even if it does not cure.
Discharge of thick yellow mucus from the nose; nose stopped up, with inclination to sneeze. Great dryness of the nose. The air passages burn after the mucus has been cleared away. The chest burns from the mere exhaling of air. Sore throat with redness. Tickling in the throat. Sensation of a hair or crumb lodged in the throat behind the larynx. Fauces very sensitive.
Arch of palate and fauces, as far as visible, very red. Burning in the throat < in the warmth, especially when warmed up in bed, < from warm drinks, though hot drinks are not so bad. Better from cold drinks. If the patient gets warm in bed or the room gets warm he commences to clutch the larynx and cough. The slightest touch on the palate or even the gums in examination of the throat will cause gagging sometimes when the parts look normal. He cannot hawk without gagging. On swallowing food sometimes it will come right back again and cause gagging and retching.
Great thirst; wants water often and in large quantities. Nauseous taste in the mouth; never rid of it. Nausea in the throat. Vomiting of white, bitter tasting froth. Toothache; sudden drawing pains in the teeth, worse from cold and from touch.
Mind: The mental symptoms are chiefly depression and anxiety. Great sadness; a cloud seems to hang over everything.
Apprehensiveness. especially at 2 to 4 A.M. This state may alternate with loquacity and liveliness, like Lachesis. There are other symptoms worse after sleep; wakes in the morning with basilar headache, or with headache in the forehead; < mental exertion; after lying down; sometimes > from slow motion; < on coughing and from exertion; > after sleep.
Kidneys: A strong feature is its action on the kidneys, resembling acute parenchymatous nephritis. Albumen in the urine. Dark red sediment in the urine. Pain shooting from the kidney to the bladder and down the legs; < from motion.
Renal colic. Urging to urinate, but inability to pass urine until a large clot of blood has been passed. In Coccus cacti the right side of the heart is affected, the vessels become friable and there is haemorrhage, oozing of blood, forming great black clots.
The above symptom suggests a woman with uterine hemorrhage. There are haemorrhages of the uterus where the blood flows freely, coagulates slowly and does not form much of any clot in the vagina. But in this remedy the clots form very rapidly and the vagina becomes packed, and the bladder cannot be emptied until the clot is expelled. Uterine hemorrhage is a strong feature of this remedy. Copious, frequent, prolonged menstrual flow. Large, hard, black clots fill the uterus, are expelled by labor-like pains, and form again. Inflammation of uterus and vagina, with copious, thick, white, jelly-like, ropy mucus. Soreness of the vulva; cannot bear the pressure of the clothing.
Haemoptysis, dark, clotted < from exertion.
In the male there is impotence with dull pain in the loins. Dull pains in the region of the kidneys, with albuminuria; heavy sediment in the urine, etc., just such a state as you would find in a child that had taken cold after scarlet fever.
Coffea
Sensitiveness: This drug is characterized by a general sensitivity. Sensitiveness of vision, of hearing, of smell, of touch; sensitiveness to pain. it is most astonishing sometimes about this great sensitiveness. Pains are increased by noise.
Sensitiveness of hearing is so great that sounds are painful. Pains in the face, toothache, headache; pains in the lower limbs; everywhere aggravated by noise.
All the nervous disturbances possible are found in this medicine, and they are all aggravated by noise. Even the opening of the door and the ringing of the door-bell produces great suffering. Such patients are so sensitive that they hear sounds which those in a state of health cannot hear.
Perhaps no medicine in the Materia Medica approximates this sensitiveness of hearing where it is accompanied with pain, unless it be Nux vom. Those practitioners who do not know this generally resort to Nux vom. for pains aggravated from voices in another room, or from noise or the sound of children.
Many remedies have increase of nervousness from noise; noise aggravates headache, and aggravates suffering about the head, and makes some persons nervous, But pain in the extremities aggravated by noise is peculiar. It seems that the noise disturbs him so that he cannot bear pain.
The Coffea state is brought on by emotions or violent excitement of the mind, but especially by joy or
W 4 Ww pleasant surprise.
The result is sleeplessness, nervous excitement, neuralgia, twitching of muscles, toothache, face ache, red face and hot head.
You may be called to the bedside of a woman who has been laboring for some great cause. She works persistently, is successful, but goes to bed with weeping, delirium, neuralgia, sleeplessness.
Her heart palpitates, her pulse flickers, she has fainting spells, and without Coffea she may die. Coffee drinkers who keep up through some ordeal and then break down are similarly affected.
The Coffea patient is sensitive to wine. A small amount of wine intensifies the nervousness, produces sleeplessness, flushed face, feverishness, great excitement. Not necessarily intoxication, but nervous excitement.
Coffea has a painful sensitiveness of the skin beyond comprehension. I remember one particular case. A woman bad her lower limb out of bed and it was as red as fire down one side. I walked toward it to put my hand on it.
But she said,
"Oh, don't touch it, I can't bear to have it touched; I can't touch it myself." I asked how long this had been coming on.
She said,
"Ob, it all came on within an hour."
Such a symptom is common in coffee drinkers. There was no fever. Intense stinging, burning pains in the skin with the redness and heat with coarse rash coming on suddenly, leaving just as suddenly. The sensitive part is aggravated by cold air, aggravated by any wind or from fanning, from motion, yet aggravated by warmth. Aggravated from anyone walking across the floor. The woman I referred to scowled when I was walking toward the bed. A number of times I have seen such things relieved within a few minutes by Coffea.
Mind: Fainting from sudden emotions. Hysteria, nervousness, weeping. Pitiful weeping from pain trembling and weeping from hurt feelings; the slightest neglect. The greatest mental and physical exhaustion; great restlessness lying awake most of the night.
The wakefulness produced by Coffea is well known, even to the laity. It is taken by nurses to keep them awake nights with their patients. The Coffea patient is quick to act and to think. So full of ideas that she lies awake nights making plans, thinking of a thousand things; utterly unable to banish the thoughts that flood the mind; hears the clocks on the distant steeples, as do Opium, China and Nux vom.
Hears the dogs barking. So great is the brain activity, the mental excitement, that she hears noises that are purely imaginary. Memory active, easy comprehension full of ideas; increased power to think and to debate. Coffea increases the mental capacity. But after a while reaction follows; she becomes stupid and sleepy.
There is no end to the fancies, to the visions. Fanciful visions come before the mind. Recalls things not thought of for years; recalls poetry that was recited in childhood. Eyes brilliant; pupils dilated; face flushed head hot.
Teeth: With all these nervous states the patient dreads the fresh air. He is extremely sensitive to cold, sensitive to the wind and cold weather. Complaints come on in the cold weather, from the cold air. Pain in the mouth and jaws, better from holding ice-cold water in the mouth.
This applies to toothache and faceache where it is deep in the jaws. Hot head; inflamed condition of the gums. Pain in the teeth; rending, tearing pain in the teeth, brought on from exposure to cold, from emotions, from excitement, from joy; aggravated from motion; ameliorated by ice or ice-cold things; aggravated by warm food.
Cannot drink warm tea, it so intensifies the pain. That is a particular. The particulars contrast with the generals. In one place you may see "better from cold" in black-faced type, but it relates to the face and jaws. Worse from cold is a general. Aversion to cold air, aversion to the open air unless it is very warm and still. Aversion to wind.
"Neuralgic toothache entirely relieved by holding cold water in the mouth, returning as it becomes warm. Toothache during the menstrual period.
Complaints of anemic children during dentition."
Children: Those nervous, excitable children that talk to the nurse and the mother very rapidly with brilliant eyes, red face, cannot go to sleep. It will quiet the patient and actually favor the growth of the tooth in a painless manner.
That is the description of a nervous child with many nervous brain and mental troubles. This child is extremely sensitive; it takes cold. The routine prescriber gives Belladonna to a child who has hot head, hot face and throbbing carotids, and when it does not help he gives more Belladonna, and increases the size of his dose until the child has a proving.
He makes a Belladonna child, out of it when Coffea would have cured it. In most instances where Belladonna is indicated the child is sluggish and stupid, and would like to sleep. With Coffea there is excitement. The child hears things its mother cannot hear; sees things; imagines things.
Wakes up in fright. Sees this, that and the other thing in the room. Wakes up excited as if it had visions. Looks for things, and finally sees they are not there. Such things are strong features of Coffea.
Ears: At times the head is hot, the face is flushed and, the eyes so brilliant that one fears apoplexy. Patients will often tell you that they hear a "noise" in the head, a ringing and roaring in the occiput.
The ear is the one organ capable of registering sounds. But strange to say, the ears are sometimes very deceiving. Roaring in the ears sometimes seems as if it were in the occiput. Sometimes it is accompanied with a sensation of tingling or bubbling in the head.
When patients say,
"T have a roaring in the head,"
you know that means in the car; many times accompanying roaring, ringing in the ears, buzzing in the ears, is a peculiar sensation of vibration in the head that is mistaken by the patient for a sound.
I mention that because the Coffea patient feels a crackling or a bubbling in the occiput. The head feels badly; it feels too small. Headache, as of something pressing hard upon the surface of the brain.
You would naturally suppose there was a pressing because of the congestive state heretofore described.
"Headache as if the whole brain were torn and bruised, or dashed to pieces. Worse from motion, noise or light."
The eye and the head symptoms are worse from noise and light. "Headache intolerable.
Head feels small, and as if filled with fluid.
Nervous hysterical headache.
One-sided headache."
There is another head symptom which is quite common. A feeling as if a nail were driven into the head. Coffea headaches are worse from walking, from motion; from the mere moving across the floor, he says he feels a draft of air on his head. And that is true of the pain in any part of the body.
If a Coffea patient should have a pain in the hand, swinging of the hand through the air will aggravate. It is worse both from the motion and from the air. I want to illustrate that in this way in order to show how sensitive he is to air, and especially the painful part to cold air; when he moves against the air, against even still air he feels it. But the amelioration of the toothache from cold is an exception, is a particular.
The neuralgia of the face is a common feature of old coffee drinkers.
Sensitive persons take coffee and finally become habituated to it. They say they cannot get along without it. They must have coffee. Such individuals should stop coffee. When coffee furnishes a crutch it is a sure indication that drinking it must be stopped.
So it is with tea or any beverage. Such persons sometimes become sensitive to coffee, and they drink it in great quantities; the face becomes red; headaches come on, and other symptoms of Coffea. Stopping coffee brings out quite a proving, and you have to study Cham. and Nux for an antidote.
In all these remedies you get opposite effects. Now Opium will illustrate that. The first effect of Opium is to constipate. Let several doses be given, and as the effects of the Opium wear off he may have diarrhea. Opium eaters can seldom stop because a diarrhea comes on. If you should ever have an Opium case and diarrhea comes on Puls. will nearly always control it. But there are individuals who reverse that. Often small doses of Opium will bring on dysentery, and if it is increased, bloody dysentery and inflammation of the bowels come on. Of course, one is action and the other the reaction.
Women: A woman who is a confirmed coffee drinker will have menses too soon and lasting too long.
Uterine hemorrhage is not uncommon. Another feature of Coffea is that the woman can scarcely wear the napkin during menstruation (Platinum).
The parts are in a state of hyperesthesia. The vagina is hot and sensitive, often preventing coition. In the text it reads
"Great sensitiveness of female genital organs, with general excitability.
She is in a state of ecstacy.
Uterine hemorrhage with excessive sensitiveness of organs and voluptuous itching. Metrorrhagia; large black lumps."
Sometimes large bright red lumps.
"Worse from every motion, with violent pain in the groins, and fear of death."
Excessive sensitiveness about the vulva with voluptuous itching, is a strong feature of Coffea, and you will often find such symptoms in coffee drinkers.
During and after labor we also see this great excitement, all these nervous manifestations. The nervous system is in a fret, and such a mental state as described comes on with after-pains; extremely sensitive to pain, cries out; sees visions; hears all sorts of noises.
Pains aggravated from motion; aggravated from noise. Wants everybody to keep still in the house. Convulsions of children.
"Puerperal convulsions.
Extreme excitability."
"Palpitation of the heart, pulse fluttering."
"Strong, quick palpitation of the heart with extreme nervousness, sleeplessness and cerebral erethism caused by unexpected news of great good fortune."
Let a woman about to go into confinement hear suddenly some unusually good news and the becomes almost ecstatic; carries the symptom all through confinement. The child is affected, the milk is affected. The milk flows away.
Hemorrhage is likely to come on. Great nervousness, excitability, fear.
Colchicum
It is rather singular that traditional medicine used Colchicum so much for gout. In all the old books it was recommended for this malady. The provings corroborate the fact that Colchicum fits into many conditions of gout.
Rheumatism: Acute rheumatism and uric acid diathesis; rheumatic complaints in general, with swelling and without swelling. But traditional medicine does not tell us what kind of gout to give it in or what kind of rheumatism.
It was really the medicine of experience. "if it is gout, try Colchicum."
The question of what was to be done with the patient when the remedy failed never came up. It was
"Give the prescription and keep at it," and drugs were administered until the patient, steadily growing worse, passed from one doctor's hands, to another's. It is true that Colchicum fits into the gouty state. Spells of cold, wet weather will slack up the flow of urine, make it scanty, or decrease the quantity of solids in the urine.
This takes place in the provings of Colchicum and has been verified many times. It is well known that such a condition will bring about or intensify the gouty state. If the solids in the twine are deficient, if they are not carried off in the urine, something must happen, and the gouty state comes on.
Colchicum is aggravated by cold, damp weather; by the cold rains in the Fall. It is aggravated by anything that will debilitate. It is aggravated in the extreme heat of summer; it has a summer rheumatism; the heat will slack up the flow of urine or the quantity of solids in the urine.
A striking feature running through the remedy is its tendency to move from one joint to another, from one side to another, from below upwards, or from above downwards. Rheumatic conditions with swelling, or without swelling; first here, next there, changing about from place to place.
Dropsical condition: Another striking feature is the general dropsical condition. When the hands and feet swell, and there is pitting on pressure. Dropsy of the abdominal cavity, of the pericardium; of the pleura and dropsy of serous sacs. Swellings that are inflammatory and rheumatic; swellings that are dropsical, with pale urine. Whether copious or scanty, still it is pale.
Muscular rheumatism and rheumatism of the white fibrous tissues of the joints. Rheumatic troubles that have been going on for some time, will end in cardiac troubles. When cardiac troubles with valvular defects are present, almost the first thing the busy doctor thinks of is a history of rheumatism.
Let me say that a part of the study of Materia Medica consists in the observation of sick people. A busy physician learns without books, though of course he should familiarize himself with the literature, so that from reading, as well as observation, he may acquire a knowledge of the general nature of sickness.
When he listens to the patient's story or makes a physical examination, he knows how such cases usually conduct themselves. He knows what to expect. He knows the natural trend of sickness and instantly recognizes what is strange and unusual. He will not recognize what is strange and unusual unless he knows what is natural.
So your books on symptomatology and pathology, diagnosis, etc., will tell you much of this, but as you gain experience in homeopathic practice you will get a much finer idea of this because your Materia Medica teaches you to observe more closely.
The Materia Medica man learns to single out and trace every little thing in order to individualize. So it may be said that years of observation in studying disease, studying the sick man along with the Materia Medica, will open to the mind a much grander knowledge of the sicknesses of humanity than can be had by practicing traditional medicine. Traditional medicine benumbs the ability to observe.
Motion <: All the complaints of this remedy are aggravated from motion. The painful complaints, the head complaints, the bowel complaints. the liver complaints, the stomach complaints, are all worse from motion. Such an aggravation from motion that he dreads to move. About as marked as we find in Bryonia.
Aversion to motion, and aggravation from motion. Aggravation from becoming cold and in cold, damp weather. He is a chilly patient, sensitive to cold. Most rheumatic patients are sensitive to cold, but there are a few exceptions. There is no greater rheumatic patient than the Ledum patient. He presents, both sides. Though he is cold, his pains are ameliorated by cold. In Colchicum the pains are ameliorated by heat, by wrapping up, by being warm.
If he moves, any suffering that he may have will be intensified. Great prostration accompanies the complaints of this remedy. Weakness of the limbs, great exhaustion, nervous exhaustion of a typhoid character. He gradually grows weaker like one going into Bright's disease. He has grown weak for some time, and he is pallid and waxy.
His hands and feet pit upon pressure. Examine the urine and you will find albumen in it. The urine becomes black like ink with albumen. There is an unusual degree of irritability of the tissues, soreness, sensitiveness to touch, sensitiveness to motion; bruised feeling of the joints and of the whole body.
Touch and motion bring on a painful sensation in the body as of. electric vibrations. Great weakness and exhaustion. He cannot exert himself in the least without causing dyspnea, Must lie down; does not want to move; sinking of strength; seems as if his life will flow out of him from motion and from exertion; so tired and exhausted.
This naturally occurs when going towards Bright's disease, when going towards a continued fever. Kidney affections and liver affections. Lassitude, prostration, anxiety. The muscles twitch and electric shocks pass through the body. A paralytic weakness was observed in the poisonous effects and too prolonged provings. The jaw hangs down, the muscles are flabby, relaxed. He lies on the back as if sinking; slides down in bed like one in typhoid, in low forms of rheumatic and in continued fevers, so great is the exhaustion. Paralysis of the limbs or of one limb, or of any part.
The Colchicum patient is almost constantly sweating, even with fever, and sometimes the sweat is cold. A draft blows upon him, suppresses that sweat and the paralytic condition of the limbs comes on; suppression of urine and retention of urine. This describes the profound character and type of sickness. Low forms of sickness; prostrating sickness; sickness with nervous trembling; with great exhaustion. After acute disease has passed away, great weakness and dropsy follows. Dropsy after scarlet fever.
With all these troubles, the stomach and the bowel symptoms are very decided. This is like Cocculus. Absolutely unable to touch food. Nausea, gagging, retching at the bare mention of food in his presence. The thought and smell of food bring on nausea and vomiting. With all these low forms of disease, these states described, we can see that this kind of weakness is little different from the Cocculus weakness.
Colchicum has delirium, prostration, depression of mind, great sensitiveness to pain, which he seems to feel in his mind, and it brings out mental symptoms. Very sensitive to pain; confusion of the mind; disorders of comprehension. Cannot understand what he reads. The headaches are all of a rheumatic character. Very often the whole skull, the pericranium, is sore as if bruised. The scalp is sensitive. Pressure in the head- constriction; pressing, bursting headaches. Heat in the head. Tearing in the scalp. Headaches are all aggravated by motion.
Eyes: The eye symptoms are of a rheumatic character, are connected with rheumatism, rheumatic fever. It is not very uncommon to have iritis in connection with rheumatic fever and it is a strong feature of
Colchicum. Ulcers of the lids, styes, much lachrymation in the open air. The tears excoriate and cause redness of the lids.
He takes cold easily. Sneezing, stuffing up of the nostrils. Nosebleed in rheumatic and gouty constitutions. But there is one feature that is more marked in Colchicum than all others. He is so sensitive to odors that he smells things which others do not smell. He smells odors from which he is nauseated.
"Strong odors make him quite beside himself."
You say "soup" or "broth," or something to eat, and he gets sick.
Nose: He can smell the things in the kitchen, in spite of much precaution, and this runs through the remedy. In typhoid fever, prostrated beyond the usual and typhoid is always prostrated enough, he is unusually prostrated. He cannot take milk, cannot take raw eggs, cannot take soup, because he gags at the mere thought of them.
He has gone on for days, and his family are afraid that he is going to starve to death. That aggravation from odors is so strong with him that it seems to take possession of him. It involves his appetite, his weakness, his stomach.
So it does seem that it is a strong feature. Notice that this is one of his loves; it is a perverted love, and the loves are general whether they are manifested through the eyes, nose or touch. It enters into his very life because it involves hatred to odor, and when it stands out in low forms of disease like the continued fevers, the exhaustive fevers and rheumatic complaints it becomes a general. It would be a particular if it were something that applied to the things alone, but you see it enters into the very innermost.
Involves a hatred, becomes mental, becomes a part of the man. He himself may be said to hate odors, hate the smell of food and the thought of it. Do not say "food" in the presence of a Colchicum patient, but give him Colchicum first, and pretty soon he will want something to eat. It removes that hatred for food. What a vital thing it must be when a man hates that which will keep him alive.
Teeth: The teeth are very sensitive. "Rheumatic teeth."
The gums settle away; after a while the teeth become loose. Pain in the teeth; rheumatic condition of the jaws and the teeth.
"Grinding of the teeth, teeth sensitive when pressed together." "Aversion to food; loathing the sight and smell," more the smell of it. "The smell of fish, eggs, fat meats or broths causes nausea even unto faintness."
The Colchicum patient may have much thirst or no thirst, or these may alternate. Nausea and vomiting are very strong features,
"Nausea and inclination to vomit, caused by swallowing saliva,
Nausea, eructations and copious, vomiting of mucus and bile.
Violent retching followed by copious and forcible vomiting of food, and then of bile."
In the stomach there is sometimes coldness and sometimes burning. Now it may be that the Colchicum patient has both coldness and burning. They are both recorded in the Repertory and in the provings, but it is sometimes difficult to tell which is which, more difficult than you will imagine unless you try a piece of ice somewhere and something very hot.
"Burning ‘in the pit of the stomach."
Coldness in the stomach. Now the abdomen furnishes us still more to observe. The abdomen is distended with flatus, tympanitic.
Great soreness in the whole abdomen just such a tympanitic condition as we have in typhoid.
If you ever happen to be in the country practicing, medicine, and the farmer's cows get into a fresh clover patch and eat themselves full and become distended so that you are afraid they are going to explode offer your services and give each one of those cows a few pellets of Colchicum.
It will be but a few minutes before the wind will get out of there to your surprise and the farmer's, too; and you may convert him to Homoeopathy. Farmers have been known to put a butcher knife into the pouch of the cow between the last short ribs to let the wind out.
The cow will get well, but Colchicum is better than the butcher's knife. The same is true of the horse; in fact, of man or beast, When the abdomen is violently distended and tympanitic, Colchicum is often a suitable remedy.
Diarrhea: Spasmodic pains, colic, tearing pains, burning, griping pains, forcing the patient to bend double. Aggravated from motion. Great tenderness and soreness with the colic. Aggravated from eating; ameliorated from bending double. And then comes the diarrhoea. It has just such a diarrhea as is found in low forms of fever. Dysenteric or diarrheic stools that are jelly like.
They form in the pan a solid mass of jelly like, coagulated mucus. Very painful, extremely painful is the Colchicum stool. Great soreness in the abdomen. Great relaxation of the parts. Protrusion of the rectum. Putrid, dark, bloody mucus.
"Bloody discharges from the bowels, with deathly nausea."
Fall dysentery, with discharges. of white mucus and violent tenesmus. Putrid, dark, clotted blood and mucus pass from the bowels. Diarrhoea with violent, colicky pains. Bloody stools with scrapings from the intestines and, protrusion of anus.
Profuse, watery stools in hot, damp weather or in the Autumn. Watery, jellylike mucus passes from anus with violent spasm in sphincter. It passes as a thin, watery flow; but as. soon as it cools, it forms a jelly.
Urines: The urine burns when it passes. It is attended with much pain. Inflammation of the kidneys, inflammation of the bladder; tenesmus; retention of urine.
The kidneys manufacture no urine; scanty urine with dropsy. The urine is inky, that is, very dark brown and sometimes almost black, loaded with albumen. This remedy conforms principally to the acute form of Bright's disease.
Heart and chest: Great dyspnoea, rapid, short breathing; the heart's impulse strong. Respiration accelerated.
The heart's impulse can be heard all over the room. Palpitation; oppression of the chest. Feels as if he had a great weight on the chest; cannot breathe. Hydrothorax; the pleural cavities distended with serum, causing the dyspnea.
"Heart's action muffled, indistinct, very weak."
Stinging, tearing pains in the muscles of the chest.
Limbs: Paralytic pains in the arms; enlarged finger joints. This also tells what a low form of sickness, what a feeble circulation this medicine brings about.
"Weakness so that he strikes the knees together while walking; pain all over as if bruised. Swelling of the joints."
The joints are most affected.
Muscular rhumatism.
Numbness, oedema, swelling of the limbs.
Colocynthis
Pains: The principal feature of Colocynth is its severe, tearing, neuralgic pains; so severe that the patient is unable to keep still. Sometimes they are > by motion - at least it appears that they are worse during rest- > by pressure and sometimes > by heat. Pains occur in the face, abdomen, along the course of the nerves.
These pains are often due to a very singular cause, namely, anger with indignation. Hence persons who are haughty and easily offended or chagrined have Colocynth complaints. Anger will be followed by violent neuralgia in the head, eyes, down the spine and in the intestines.
In spite of extreme restlessness there is great weakness with the pains. It patient suffering with chronic diarrhoea, with severe colic, will sometimes become so weak that he can hardly speak. A feeling of faintness, or even fainting, is by no means an unusual concomitant of the pains. Griping occurs along the course of nerves, and in some cases numbness, pricking and tingling, like the crawling of ants in the part affected.
With many doctors Colocynth is a routine remedy for sciatica; and only when it fails to do they take the symptoms of the case in order to find the remedy that is indicated. There is no excuse for such practice. Where the pain is better from hard pressure and from heat, where it is worse during repose and drives the patient to despair, Colocynth will generally cure.
But it is not indicated in all cases. Some remedies select the muscles and tendons, some the bones and periosteum, while others select the great nerve trunks in which to manifest their symptoms. The pains of Colocynth appear, as a rule, in the larger nerves.
The mental symptoms are not very striking. As soon as the prover of Colocynth begins to have pains a long the course of nerves he becomes irritable; everything vexes him; he is worse from vexation.
Screams with the pains. Walks about the room and becomes increasingly anxious as the pain goes on. Disinclined to talk or to answer, or to see friends. His friends irritate him and he wants to be alone. He has all he can do to stand those terrible pains.
Vomiting and diarrhea frequently come with the pains, especially if they are in the abdomen.
Colic comes on in paroxysms that grow in intensity. The patient becomes increasingly nauseated until finally he vomits and he continues to retch after the stomach is empty.
Colocynth produces a state in the nervous system like that found in individuals who have for years been laboring under annoyances and vexations. A man whose business affairs have been going wrong becomes irritable and nervous exhaustion follows.
A woman who must watch her unfaithful husband night and day to keep him away from other women gradually assumes a sensitive irritable state of mind and is upset by the least provocation. This is the state of the Colocynth prover.
You will seldom find this medicine indicated in strong, vigorous, healthy people who have suddenly become sick. It is more likely to be in the constitution just described, and those who are in the habit of overeating.
We find tearing pains in the scalp, brought on by anger; exhaustion, pains that are better from pressure and heat, and worse when not in motion. Constant, gnawing pains in the head.
Head: Painful, tearing, digging through the whole brain, becoming unbearable when moving the eyelids. Intense pain through the whole head; worse from moving the eyes. Severe, pressing, tearing headache, causing her to cry out.
Intermittent headache in those of a rheumatic, gouty or nervous diathesis. Pain tearing and screwing together. Violent periodical or intermittent headache.
Such are some of the expressions in the text. But the particular character of the pain is not as important as the circumstances that are likely to cause it and the conditions in which the patient has been living.
Eyes: Knowing the life of a patient affords much knowledge of the patient himself. The same violent neuralgic pains are found in the eye. Rheumatic iritis, worse in the evening and night. Severe, burning, cutting and sticking pains in the eye. Burning is more characteristic of the pains of the eyes than of other parts of the head and face. Sharp, cutting- stabs; pressing pains.
Face: The faceache is especially important, because Colocynth is one of the most frequently indicated remedies for neuralgia of this region.
There are some remedies which are indicated in faceache more often than any others, Belladonna, Magnesia Phosphorica and Colocynth.
The Belladonna pains are as violent as any, and are accompanied by red face, flashing eyes, hot head, and great sensitiveness of the part to touch.
In Colocynth the pains come in waves, are better from heat, from pressure, worse if anything during rest, and are brought on by excitement or vexation.
They are generally on the left side; while those of Belladonna are on the right, and are caused by cold.
Magnesia phosphorica has tearing and pains that shoot like lightning along the nerves and are relieved by heat and pressure.
The expression of the Colocynth face is one of anxiety from the severity of the suffering. No matter where the pain is the face is distorted. Finally, it becomes pale and the cheeks become blue.
Tearing pains in the cheek-bones, or more correctly, in the infra orbital nerve where it emerges from the foramen. Sometimes this pain feels like a hot wire, sometimes like a cold nail, and sometimes it is tearing, burning or stinging.
Frequently it spreads over the face, following the ramifications of the small branches of the nerve, usually on the left side. The patient cries out and is very restless. Tearing or burning pain extending to the ear and head.
All pains are better from pressure, but this is in the beginning. After the pain has been going for several days with increasing severity, the part becomes very sensitive and pressure cannot be endured.
Stomach: Aversion to food. Violent thirst. Colic brought on from drinking while overheated; from eating indigestible things, from high living; colic from eating potatoes.
Potatoes and starchy foods disagree with the Colocynth patient like Alumina. The vomiting of Colocynth is different from that of most other remedies .
Nausea does not appear at first, but when the pain becomes sufficiently intense nausea and vomiting begin, the contents of the stomach are ejected and the patient continues to retch until the severity of the suffering decreases.
The stomach pains are clutching, cramping and digging; as if grasped by the fingers.
Abdomen: Similar pains occur lower down in the abdomen, but they are still better from hard pressure, and from doubling up which amounts to pressure, come on in paroxysms of increasing severity, until the patient is nauseated and vomits, and are associated with great restlessness and faint, sinking feeling at the pit of the stomach.
The victim, bends down over the back of a chair, or over the foot-board if unable to get out of bed.
In the Guiding Symptoms we find several pages of repetitions, showing how extensively this medicine is applicable in abdominal complaints where these symptoms are present. It would be well to read them.
The pains in the lower part of the abdomen are relieved by drawing up the limbs and pressing with the fists. In the violent ovarian neuralgias of Colocynth, the woman will flex the limb of the painful side hard against the abdomen and hold it there.
The physician asks:
"What has happened to give you these pains?
Her answer is likely to be:
"My servant spilled some dirty water on a handsome rug, we had some words over it, and this is the result. "
Colic from anger with indignation; better from bending double and worse in the upright position, while standing or bending backwards.
Colic of infants when they are relieved by lying on the stomach as soon as the position is changed they begin to scream again,
The same symptoms accompanying the diarrhoea and dysentery, The stools consists of white mucus, are thick, ropy and jelly-like; at times bloody.
At first they may be copious, strong smelling, pappy, and later watery, yellow, scanty and almost inodorous.
Diarrhoea and dysentery from anger with indignation; the most awful tenesmus during stool; urging to stool with colic. Eating ever so little, rings on the colic, urging and stool. Watery stools after eating. Many of these cases, find relief from heat and the warmth of the bed.
Conium Maculatum
This medicine is a deep, long acting antipsoric, establishing a state of disorder in the economy that is so far reaching and so long lasting that it disturbs almost all the tissues of the body.
Glands: The complaints are brought on from taking cold, and the glands become affected all over the body. From every little cold the glands become hard and. sore. Infiltration in deep-seated diseases in the region of ulcers and in the region of inflamed parts; in the glands along the course of the lymphatics, so we get a chain like knots.
The glands under the arm inflame and ulcerate. The glands in the neck, in the groin and abdomen become enlarged. Ulcerated parts indurate. An abscess of the breast becomes surrounded by lumps and nodules. Nodules in the breast even where milk has not yet formed; lumps and nodules, indurations and enlarged glands form under the skin all over the body.
Conium has been used extensively for malignant affections of glands, because it takes hold of glands from the beginning and infiltrates, and they gradually grows a stony hardness, like scirrhus.
Now, another grand feature running through this remedy is the action upon the nerves.
Trembling, jerking of the muscles and twitching from the weakness of the nerves. Inability to stand any physical effort without great exhaustion.
Gradually growing paralytic weakness, somewhat as was described in Cocculus. Exhaustion of body and mind, that is a general slowing down of all the activities of the body. The liver becomes indurated, sluggish, enlarged. The bladder is weak, can expel only a part of the urine. Or sometimes there is a paralytic condition and no expulsive power. This shows that the remedy increases toward a paralytic weakness.
Mind: Hysteria. Hypochondriacal state of mind, with the nervousness, trembling and weakness of the muscles. He gets tired in the earlier stages, but finally this goes on until the limbs are paralytic.
A great many of the complaints are painless. The ulcers and the paralytic conditions are painless. Great physical and mental debility; great prostration of the muscular system; exhaustion, tremulous weakness.
Paralysis of the legs and hip. Mental symptoms, nervous symptoms, trembling, in widows and widowers who have suddenly been deprived of their sexual relations.
When in a state of considerable vigor, if suddenly deprived, the woman or the man takes on a state of trembling weakness, inability to stand any mental effort, and inability to put the attention upon things said by others.
Not so marked or not so common in the woman as in the man. When this state comes on in a woman who is of unusual sexual vigor there may be severe congestion of the uterus and ovaries, Apis is more likely to fit her symptoms than Conium. But with hysteria and excitability Conium is often the remedy. Many of its symptoms come about from such a cause.
Conium has such a deep action that it gradually brings about a state of imbecility. The mind gives out. The mind at first becomes tired like the muscles of the body. Unable to sustain any mental effort. The memory is weak.
The mind will not concentrate, it will not force itself to attention; it cannot meditate, and then comes imbecility. Inability to stand any mental effort or to rivet the attention upon anything are some of the most important symptoms in this medicine.
Insanity of a periodical type. Imbecility, though, is far more frequent than insanity. When you come to examine the mental states you will see symptoms that will make you think the patient is delirious, but that is not quite it.
It is a slow-forming weakness of mind; not that rapid, active state, such as accompanies a fever; it is a delirium without a fever, so to speak, which is not constant. Forms of insanity that are passive. He thinks slowly, and he continues in this stage for weeks and months, if he recovers at all.
Those excitable cases that have more or less violence and activity in mental states are such as will correspond to Bell., Stram. and Ars.
You see nothing of that in this medicine. This state of the mind has come on so gradually that the family has not observed it.
The mind is full of strange things that have come little by little, and when the family look over the many things that he has done and said they begin to wonder if he is not becoming insane, but he is traveling toward a state of imbecility.
Conium is of a slow, passive character. Complete indifference; takes no interest in anything, particularly when walking in the open air.
"He is averse to being near people and to talking of those passing him; is inclined to seize hold of and abuse them."
That, of course is an insane act. "Sad and gloomy.
Great unhappiness of mind, recurring every fourteen days," showing a two weeks periodicity. The Conium patient will sit and mope in the corner in a state of sadness and depression, giving no reason only that he is so sad.
A hypochondriacal subject going around with whims and notions that people attempt to reason him out of, and the more they attempt to reason with him, the more sad he is. Morose, peevish, vexed.
Every thing vexes and disturbs him. Cannot endure any kind of excitement, it brings on physical and mental distress, brings on weakness and sadness. Sometimes Conium symptoms will be found in persons who have suffered from grief; they become broken in memory. This is likely to come first.
They forge, never can recall things just as they want them. And so they grow weaker and weaker until they become imbeciles. If it is decidedly mental, imbecility results; if it is taking physical course the ending is paralysis, and it is not uncommon for general paralytic weakness to come on, so that body and mind progress toward weakness together until some decided manifestation is made, and then it will be seen to be going toward paralysis, or some decided manifestation is made which will send it toward imbecility, and then the body will seem to remain stationary.
There comes a time in these cases where there is a sort of division between the body and the mind. Whenever under homoeopathic treatment the physical, improves and the mental grows worse, that patient will never be cured. There are such cases. I never like to see the physical grow better and the mental grow worse in any degree.
That does not mean the aggravation caused by the remedy. If the mental does not improve it means that the patient is growing worse. There is no better evidence of the good action of a remedy than mental improvement.
Conium patients cannot endure even the slightest alcoholic drink.
Any wine or stimulating beverage will bring on trembling, excitement, weakness of mind and prostration. There are many headaches -in these patients. Patients going into decline will manifest headaches. Stitching, tearing pains in the head; throbbing in the head. Signs precursory to a giving out of the brain. Neuralgia.
Pains: Weakness of muscles. Weakness of muscles on one side of the face. Paralysis of the upper lids. Tingling pains. These are only in keeping with the signs of a general breakdown. We would not think of giving Conium for those sudden, violent congestions of the brain, or sudden, violent attacks of pain in the head, face or eyes, but those that accompany a general progressive disease.
There are stitching, lancinating, knife-like pains along the course of nerves about face and eyes and head. Stitching in the top of the head. Burning on top of the head. Often the symptoms will lead the
homoeopathic physician to make a physical examination. A great deal more important than the physical examination are, the symptoms that point out a remedy.
Excitement will bring on headaches. Numbness of the scalp is one of the common symptoms of Conium. It is a general; wherever there is trouble there will be numbness, numbness with pains, very often numbness with the weakness.
Paralytic conditions are attended with numbness. Sick headache with inability to urinate. Great giddiness. Everything in the room seems to go around. Confused feeling in the head. Often sits lost in thought.
Vertigo: Vertigo and pressure in the head with unaltered pulse. Vertigo, worse from stooping. The slightest spirituous drink intoxicates him. Vertigo when turning the head, like turning in a circle, when rising from a seat; worse when lying down, as though the bed were turning in a circle; when turning in bed or when looking around.
The vertigo most common in Conium is that which comes on while lying in bed rolling the eyes or turning the eyes. This is somewhat as it is in Cocculus, not as to vertigo alone, but the general slowed down condition of the muscles. The paresis, or weakness of the muscles all over the body is also present in the eyes.
There is a muscular weakness of all the muscles of the eye, so that the Conium patient is unable to watch moving objects without getting sick headaches, visual and mental disturbances. Riding on the cars, watching things in rapid motion and inability to focus rapidly, slowness of the accommodation is what we must call it is the cause for many sicknesses.
Eyes: Inability to follow moving objects with sufficient rapidity and a headache comes on.
"Objects look red, rainbow colored, striped; confused spots; double vision; weakness of sight. Short sighted; cannot read long without letters running together."
All this is due to defective accommodation.
"Sluggish adaptation of the eye to varied range of vision. Vision becomes blurred when he is irritable.
Weakness and dazzling of the eyes, together with dizziness. Aversion to light without inflammation of the eyes."
The pupil will not accommodate itself to the changes between strong light and dim light, and he suffers from it. Severe photophobia and lachrymation. Photophobia without congestion of any tissue without or within the globe of the eye.
Sometimes the pupils are contracted and sometimes dilated. Conium has cured ulcer of the cornea. "Burning in the eyes when reading."
‘Shooting smarting, burning pain in the eyes.
The lids indurate, thicken and are heavy and fall.
It is with, difficulty that he can lift them up.
So this paralysis extends all through the muscles of the body and affects the mind similarly. "
Could scarcely raise the eyelids, they seemed pressed down by a heavy weight.
Burning on entire surface of lids; Hordeola; paralysis of muscles of the eyes."
Glands: A marked condition is that of swelling of the glands about the face, ear and under the jaws. The parotids are swollen and, hard. The same gradually increasing hardness in the sub-maxillary and sublingual
glands.
Enlargement of the glands of the side of the neck in cancerous affections. It has cured epithelioma of the lid, and of the nose and of the cheek. Ulcers about the lip with induration. Deep under the ulcer there will be hardness, and along all the vessels that send lymph towards that ulcer there will be a chain of knots.
Paresis extending to paralysis of the oesophagus; difficulty in swallowing; food goes down part way and stops. As food is about to pass the cardiac orifice it stops and enters with a great effort.
"Strange rising in the throat, with sense of stuffing, as if something were lodged there. Sense of fullness in the throat as of a lump with involuntary attempts at swallowing. Fullness in throat with suppressed eructations.
Pressure in oesophagus as if a round body were ascending from stomach."
That is a nervous affection found in nervous women and bas been called globus hystericus. When a woman feels as if she wanted to cry, and she swallows and chokes, she will have a similar lump in the throat.
Nervous, broken-down constitutions; tired of life; sees nothing in the future but sickness and sorrow and paralysis or imbecility. When they have their lucid moments they weep, become sad over their enlarged glands and weakness, and have a lump in the throat.
Stomach: There are many stomach troubles; ulceration of the stomach; cancer of the stomach. Conium is one of the greatest palliatives in symptoms of the stomach when all the symptoms agree.
It will palliate cancerous conditions for a while, then on comes the difficulty again, because when the symptoms have advanced sufficiently to indicate Conium many times there is no hope of cure.
Hardness of the abdomen, great sensitiveness of the abdomen. Pinching pains, stitching pains, colicky, cutting pains, cramping pains. Bearing down in the abdomen-in the woman as if the uterus would escape.
Often more common than diarrhoea is constipation with ineffectual urging, hard cool, paralysis of the rectum. Inability to strain at cool, inability to expel contents because of the paralytic weakness of all the muscles that take part in expulsion.
Pulsation and emptiness in the abdomen after a normal stool The woman strains so much at stool that the uterus protrudes- from the vagina. After every stool tremulous weakness and palpitation.
Urines: The urine will stop and start. He strains to, expel the urine and gets tired and stops.
The stream of urine stops and without any pressure whatever it starts again and it does that two or three times during urination. Irregular muscular actions while passing urine.
"Intermittent flow of urine, with cutting after micturition.
Urine turbid after standing."
Weakness of the sexual powers of the male; impotency.
Men: He may have most violent sexual desire yet he is impotent. "Great sexual desire with partial or complete incapacity. Emissions without dreams.
Painful emissions and painful ejaculations."
"There is a catarrhal state of the seminal vesicles attended with much soreness, so that when ejaculation takes place there is cutting like a knife, as if the semen were acrid.
Bad effects from suppressed sexual desire in widowers and those who have been accustomed to coition. "Sexual weakness. Insufficient erection, lasting only a short time; weakness after embrace.
Swelling and induration of testicles."
Hardness and swelling of the testicles gradually comes on.
"Discharge of prostatic fluid on every change of emotion, without voluptuous thoughts, or while expelling faeces; with itching of the prepuce."
Hence we have a strange intermingling of increased irritability of the parts, the neck of the bladder, sexual organs, prostrate gland, with weakness, with impotency.
Women: In the male, remember, there is induration and enlargement of the testicles; in the woman induration and enlargement of the ovaries and uterus.
"Uterine spasms during too early and scanty menses."
Soreness in the abdomen in the early stages of gestation, motions of the child are painful. Burning, stinging, tearing pains in the neck of the uterus.
Great soreness of the breasts. This medicine has dwindling of the mammary glands as well as enlargement and induration. Suppressed menstruation, painful menstruation, throbbing, tearing, burning pains in the uterus and in the ovaries, in the pelvis.
It has cured fibroid tumors of the uterus. It has restrained cancerous growth of the cervix. One of the most distressing growths known to women is a cancerous growth of the cervix. It is the most difficult to check of all the cancerous affections known.
It will progress most rapidly, but Conium is one of those remedies that will slow down that inflammation and restrain somewhat the hemorrhages. Conium has produced induration and infiltration of the cervix.
Respiration and cough: Difficult breathing. Dry cough almost constantly, worse lying in bed. Cough when first lying down. Is obliged to sit up and cough is out.
Taking a deep breath causes cough. Such are the striking features of a Conium cough. In the chest, violent stitches. Painful swelling of the breasts. Rending, tearing pains in the chest.
Back: In the back, weakness is a most striking thing, with some dorsal pains, Lancinating pains are spoken of.
"III effects of bruises and shocks to the spine."
After injuries, especially in the lumbar region, pains and filling up of the veins of the lower limbs. Rheumatic pains; paralysis of the lower limbs; ulceration. And the sufferings and conditions are better by letting the limbs hang down.
Conium differs from a great many medicines. It is common for pains and aches to be relieved by putting the feet up on a chair; by putting them up in bed.
But the patient with the rheumatism, with the ulceration of the legs and the other strange sufferings of the legs, will lie down and permit his legs to hang over the bed up as far as the knee. That is something that somebody ought to undertake to account for, so we could have at least one thing we could prescribe for under pathology. But up to date we have no explanation. Tottering gait in middle-aged men.
Another grand feature of the remedy; he sweats copiously during sleep, Sometimes the patient will say that if he merely closes the eyes he will sweat. It is certainly true on closing the eyes preparatory to going to sleep he will break out in a sweat.
Owing to the fact that Conium produces such a marked induration and infiltration of tissues that have been inflamed, stenoses are apt to form where inflammation has been present. Stricture of the urethra and stenosis of the os uteri have been cured by Conium.
Crotalus Horridus
(Rattlesnake)
Aspect: The first impression would be to rebel against the use of such substances as Crotalus, Lachesis, Apis and other animal poisons, and it is true that the lay mind must look with something like horror upon their administration; but when they are properly used and when we consider the dreadfulness of the necessity demanding them, and also when we have ascertained that there can be no substitute when demanded, and again that they are potentized and changed until they are perfectly pure, because reduced to a state of simple substance, the horror passes away from the mind.
It is true that the diseases that call for the use of such substances as Crotalus are very grave. When at the bedside of a Crotalus patient one feels that death is very near, the subject is horrible to look upon, and the mother in regard to her child, or the husband, would immediately say,
"Doctor, use anything in order to save the life; resort to anything in order to heal this sick one."
The symptoms are peculiar in Crotalus. The remedy stands out by itself. There can be no substitute for it, as there is no other remedy, taken as a whole, that looks it.
The other snake poisons form the nearest resemblance, but this one is the most dreadful of all, excepting perhaps, the Ancistrodon contortrix (Copperhead).
In the case of snake bites we get the most dire effects; we see death itself, we see the ending after a very rapid course, the very highest type of zymosis. These snake poisons are supposed to be cyanhydrates of soda and other salts.
It is known that alcohol is the natural solvent of the cyanhydrates, and because of this alcohol has been used in great quantities in snake bites, and it has frequently prolonged and even saved life. If he lives through the violent attack he goes on forever manifesting the chronic effects, and from these we have collected symptoms.
Dogs that have been bitten manifested the chronic effects of rattlesnake bite, and in them a peculiar periodicity has been manifested, viz., every spring as the cold weather subsides and the warm days begin
I once had the privilege of tracing up a dog that had been bitten by the Cenchris and had survived. It was bitten in the region of the neck, and in that region a large abscess formed every spring as long as that dog lived, until old age, when he died from that disease. The periodicity in the snake poisons is related to the spring, to the coming on of the warm weather.
Another marked general feature in Crotalus, as in most of the other Ophidians, is that the patient sleeps into the aggravation.
The poison of the Crotalus horridus, in its earliest manifestations, is like unto the zymotic changes that we find in scarlet fever, in diphtheria, in typhoid and low forms of blood poisoning, those cases that come on with great rapidity, breaking down of the blood, relaxation of the blood vessels, bleeding from all of the orifices of the body, rapidly increasing unconsciousness like one intoxicated and besotted in appearance.
Prostration: A mental and physical prostration that is almost paralytic in character. Scarlet fever when it becomes putrid; typhoid when it becomes putrid, diphtheria with much bleeding and putridity. The body appears mottled, blue intermingled with yellow jaundice comes on with astonishing quickness, and the eyes become yellow, and the skin becomes yellow and mottled. Blue in spots. Black and blue spots as if bruised, intermingled with yellow. After hemorrhages the skin becomes extremely anemic.
It is yellow, pale, bloodless. The body looks like wax. Hemorrhage from the ears, eyes, nose, lungs, from the mucous membranes everywhere, from the bowels, from the uterus, A haemorrhagic constitution.
Crotalus is indicated in disease of the very lowest, the most putrid type, coming on with unusual rapidity, reaching that putrid state in an unusually short time. One who has been poisoned rapidly sinks into, this besotted, benumbed. putrid, semi-conscious state. There is a feeling as if death were coming over him. As
the blood oozes out it becomes black, It is sometimes fluid.
An awful state of nervousness prevails. Trembling of the limbs, tremulous weakness. On protruding the tongue it comes out quivering. Tired by the slightest exertion. Sudden prostration of the vital powers. A paralytic weakness prevails throughout.
Twitching of the muscles, trembling of the limbs. Sliding down in bed occurs in the typhoid conditions where this remedy has proved of benefit, the forms of yellow fever with great prostration. This species of yellow fever has been cured by this remedy. Convulsions and paralysis. It has twitching of muscles something like chorea, trembling, localized spasms, hysterical manifestations.
Mind: The mental symptoms are well worth examining. The low form of delirium, muttering, talking to himself is a peculiar form of loquacity. It differs somewhat from Lachesis. Both have loquacity.
The Lach. loquacity is so rapid that if anyone in the room commences to tell something the patient will take it up and finish the story, although he has never heard anything about it, so active is his mind. No one is permitted to finish a story in the presence of a Lach. patient. One will commence to tell something. He will say,
"Oh, yes; I understand it and he will go off on another line and finish up with something entirely different.
Crotalus does that, too, but Crotalus will take it up and mumble and stumble over his words in a clumsy manner.
It is a low passive state like intoxication; in Lach. it is wild excitement. "Delirium with languor, drowsiness, stupor."
That tells it.
"Loquacious delirium with desire to escape from bed."
It is passive, however. His motions are slow.
"Muttering delirium of typhus.
Sadness."
His thoughts dwell on death continually.
"Excessive sensitiveness.
Moved to tears by reading.
Melancholy with timidity, fear. Anxious and pale, with cold sweat. Irritable, cross, infuriated by least annoyance."
On motion there is vertigo, dizziness. On keeping still there is pain. On going to sleep there is pain, and he is roused by violent pain. The longer he sleeps the more severe that pain in the head.
Sleep: He sleeps into his symptoms. All the snake poisons more or less sleep into troubles. The head troubles come on after sleep. He sleeps into headache. The longer he sleeps the harder are the headaches.
Head: The headache is so hard in the back of the head that it is almost impossible to raise it from the pillow. The muscles become so tired he has to take hold of it with his hands. This belongs also to Lach. A congestive headache with waxy face, yellow, purple, mottled face, as if there had been bruises. "Headache extending into the eyes.
Bilious headache every few days."
Severe sick headache, together with dizziness, throbbing in the top of the head. Dull, pulsating headaches. Dull, heavy, throbbing, occipital headaches or the whole head is in a state of congestion. He is confused and dazed. Head feels too large.
Head feels full, feels as if it would burst. Headaches that come on in waves as if they came up the back, a surging of blood upwards, an orgasm described as if the blood rushed upwards.
Headache with surging in waves and excited by motion or jar, by turning over in bed, by rising up in bed, or
by lying down. Change of position will cause this surging. In Lach. it is described, and I have seen it verified, as beginning away down in the spine and surging upward coincident with the pulse.
Eyes: Hemorrhage from the eyes. Yellow appearance of the eyes. "Blood exudes from the eye, burning in eyes; redness with lachrymation."
Pressure in the eyes as if the eyes would be pushed out from the head. Paralysis of the upper lids. Inflammation of the mucous membrane of the lids.
Ears: Surging in the ears.
"Sensitive to noises."
Dull aching and throbbing in the ears. Foetid, copious, yellow, offensive, bloody discharges from the ears. Blood oozing from the ears in drops in zymotic diseases, low forms of scarlet fever, or of diphtheria where
there is oozing from the eyes and ears, and copious bleeding from the nose.
The nose is the most common organ to bleed in zymotic diseases. The rush of blood seems to get relief from bleeding from the nose. In this medicine the congestion to the head is violent with bleeding from the nose. It has cured all forms of foetid discharge. Horrible, foetid, putrid discharges from the nose. Ozoena.
Inflammation of the parotid gland. Blueness and discoloration of the face. Yellow appearance of the face, a marked condition of jaundice. In girls who appear waxy or anemic, yellowish green, have for a long time missed the menstrual period and break out in pustules and pimples.
Mouth: This patient often wakes up during the night grinding the teeth. The taste is bad, putrid. Inflammation of the gums. Bleeding from the mouth. Inflammation of the throat with bleeding of the throat. Burning in the throat and mouth, Trembling, quivering and swollen tongue. Trembling of the tongue when it is put out. Trembling of the hands when they are moved.
Those cases of diphtheria that ooze blood from the nose and mouth are very low types, and are sure to die without a well-selected remedy. The throat will be filled up under such circumstances with a diphtheritic membrane that looks dark. There is bleeding all around it. Sore mouth with bleeding. Ulcers in the mouth. Ulcers after Merc. in, those who are pouring forth saliva on the pillow at night. Bleeding ulcers in the mouth. Difficult swallowing. Malignant diphtheria.
Cannot lie on the right side or back without instantly producing black, bilious vomiting. This is a wonderfully bilious remedy, sick headaches, vomiting of bile in great quantities.
The various low forms of disease calling for Crotalus often, begin with vomiting great quantities of bile, sometimes bile mixed with blood.
Stomach: Pain in the stomach; coldness as if a piece of ice were in the stomach or in the abdomen. Stomach irritable, unable to retain anything, constantly throws up blood.
Crotalus has cured ulceration of the stomach. It has greatly restrained the growth of carcinoma when there is much vomiting of bile and blood. Vomiting in many instances where the blood has no tendency to coagulate.
Now, with all these ulcerations of the stomach, cancerous affections, low zymotic disease, jaundice is nearly always present; jaundice and more or less of bleeding; fever seldom runs high; sometimes the temperature
is subnormal, but with oozing and bleedings, with dark hemorrhage from the nose and mouth and dark, scanty, bloody urine containing albumen.
Abdomen: The abdomen is greatly distended like the tympanitic abdomen of typhoid and the low zymotic diseases. Ulceration of the bowels, hemorrhage from the bowels. Much pain and soreness in the abdomen with numbness.
Feeling in it as if it were made of wood.
"Stool black, thin, like coffee grounds.
Dysentery of septic origin from foul water, food, etc.
Diarrhoea from noxious effluvia."
Inflammation of the ovaries and of the uterus. Low form of putrid fever.
Women: Hemorrhages, Either dark clots or blood that has no tendency to coagulate and keeps on flowing. There is great trouble at the climacteric period. Hot flashes. Jaundice. Hemorrhage from the uterus or from other parts.
Cancer of the uterus with much bleeding. Great offensiveness. Patient becomes yellow, jaundiced, great exhaustion, mottled appearance of the skin, swelling of the face, of the leg, especially along the course of the veins. Phlegmasia alba dolens. Worse from the slightest touch. Worse from jar, from motion.
There is some reason to think that this will be more or less a heart remedy from the great cardiac weakness it produces. But the other snake poisons like Naja, Lach. and Elaps have had more clinical application than this one.
This one seems to prostrate the heart, but also to prostrate the whole body, and its complaints are more general. Mottled appearance of the limbs. Gangrenous appearance of the extremities.
Skin: Boils, carbuncles and eruptions are surrounded by a purplish condition of the skin, a mottled, blue, splotched or marbled state. It produces boils, abscesses and a condition somewhat resembling a carbuncle, with burning and violent pains, but the peculiar feature is the doughy centre.
Around the boil or carbuncle for many inches there is oedema, with pitting upon pressure. The boil, or abscess, or carbuncle will bleed a thick, black blood that will not coagulate. Carbuncles that come upon the neck and upon the back begin with a pustule, and then several come and they are surrounded by little pustules and papules and there is pitting upon pressure.
For these carbuncles you will need to study particularly Arsenicum, Anthracinum, Lachesis, Secale and Crotalus. They are the medicines that have in their nature malignancy and manifestation.
In puerperal fever there is a continued oozing of black offensive blood that will not coagulate; bleeding from every orifice of the body as well as from the uterus. Imagine a woman who is pregnant suffering from typhoid fever.
She aborts and a low zymotic state comes on with the symptoms that I have described and with all the appearances as if she would bleed to death after the abortion. The blood will not coagulate and the flow continues. Or in a woman during a typhoid fever menstruation comes on. It is not a true menstrual flow, that is, it does not resemble the ordinary flow, because it is copious, dark and liquid, a continuous oozing with all the grave symptoms described, and especially the besotted countenance, the comatose state, the appearance as if she were intoxicated, lying as one dead. When aroused every muscle trembles; if the tongue is protruded it trembles, and there is inability to articulate.
Crotalus may save her life. Would it be possible to think of graver states of sickness than such as are produced by the ophidia?
When a physician sees these symptoms coming on he immediately thinks of a class of remedies that can cover such a state, remedies like Baptisia, Arsenicum, Secale and the Ophidia, and sometimes Arnica, Phosphorus and Pyrogen.
Sleep: In the more chronic conditions the individual manifests a terrible state as to his sleep. He rises from sleep as in a fright; has horrible dreams of murder, of death, of dead bodies and dead people, of associating with the dead and with corpses, of being in graveyards; even the smell of the cadaver is dreamed of.
While he is awake he is tired, he is stupid, he cannot add figures, he makes mistakes in writing, he transposes sentences, and in words he transposes letters. He is unable to take care of his own accounts, for he cannot add up things that are at all particular. Sleep alternates with long and tedious periods of wakefulness.
He is disturbed by any change to warm weather. Great irritability, sensitive to spheres, easily disturbed by his surroundings, and easily wrought up into a pitch of excitement are also features of this remedy.
Following this up he is suspicious of his friends and is unable to reason upon a rational basis. He craves intoxicating drinks and is unable to resist the craving. This wonderful resemblance to old inebriates has led to the use of Crotalus in delirium tremens; it has the besotted countenance, the purple aspect of the face, the peculiar kind of hunger in the drunkard, the craving by spells for stimulants.
There is every reason to believe that in fat, robust, besotted drunkards it may, if properly used, be a remedy deep enough to remove the appetite for strong drink.
Croton Tiglium
Skin: Croton oil, when applied to the skin, produces both vesicles and pustules upon an inflamed base, and the part becomes very red and sore.
The inflammation often increases until it resembles erysipelas, but more commonly the eruption produced resembles a vesicular eczema. This eruption will come on for a few days and will then desiccate, and ina few days longer it will desquamate.
When one has been overdosed, as is done in a too prolonged proving, or by the crude drug, or when the prover has been markedly sensitive, we get an alternation of states, the internal alternating with the external.
After the eruption is out the internal manifestations are not present, as is seen in the rheumatic state, the cough and the bowel symptoms. If we study these groups separately we will find they are all interesting.
Cough: First, its cough. It has an asthmatic cough, coming on in the middle of the night, often arousing the patient from a sound sleep. Attacks of violent coughing, with dyspnoea and choking, worse at night and worse on lying down, compelling him to sit up, to be bolstered up in bed, or to sit up in a reclining chair.
His friends wonder if he is not going into consumption. If it is a child they wonder whether it is not whooping cough. There is extreme irritation of the air passages, so that the inhalation of air brings on the cough. Sensitive to deep breathing. Now, this will go on for a while and finally he will break out with an eruption somewhere upon the body, vesicles and pustules, in clusters and patches, that become inflamed and red and finally dry up and desquamate and disappear, and then back comes his cough. This may go on as a chronic state, and when such is the case it will be very well to know this remedy.
Bowels: The next most important symptoms are the bowel symptoms, and perhaps they are the best known of any of its symptoms outside of the eruption. It is suitable in both acute and chronic diarrhoea. It is suitable in cholera infantum.
The marked feature is the extreme, suddenness with which the stool is ejected. It seems to come out in one gush of yellow, watery or pappy stool; soft, thin faeces, coming, out with one gush, so marked is this that it is not an uncommon thing for a rural patient to describe it as "like that of a goose."
It all gushes out in one squirt.
The mother says of the little patient: "You would be astonished, doctor, at the violent rush, for it all comes out with one squirt."
That is descriptive. Many remedies have a holding on and a prolonged effort at stool, until it takes quite a long time. Many of the diarrheas are prolonged with numerous little gushes of thin feeces or water, but this particular feature is striking.
It may not always be so, but this violent gush of thin, yellow faeces or yellow water is a striking feature of the remedy.
With this the abdomen is very sensitive, and is greatly distended; there is much gurgling in the bowel, and when the physician puts his hand upon it the patient will say he feels the gurgling, as if he were full of water, and it probably is so, for the expulsion of the stool would not occur in one strong gush were it not for the fact that the colon and rectum were full of fluid.
Another peculiar thing commonly attending Croton tig. diarrheas is that pressure over the abdomen or pressure about the umbilicus causes a pain in the rectum and urging to stool, and a feeling, with the expulsion of the stool, as if the rectum would protrude. Clinically it has been described as if the pain followed the intestines all the way down to the anus.
The taking of a little water, or of a little milk, what would ordinarily be suitable food for such a diarrhea, will at times cause an instant urging to stool; he must go to stool immediately after eating.
This gives the general features of the Croton tig. diarrhoea. If it is in an infant there is great exhaustion, tympanitic abdomen, much rumbling of the bowels, great sinking, and as soon as the infant takes one mouthful of milk or draws from the mother's breast it expels a gush of liquid or pappy stool.
Eyes: Another most important group of symptoms is its eye symptoms. It has eye symptoms of an inflammatory character, and around the eyes and upon the lids are vesicles and pustules.
Pustules upon the cornea, granular lids. Inflammation of all the tissues of the eye. It has an inflammation of the iris and conjunctiva. The blood vessels of the eyes are distended, the eye looks red and raw. The eyelids when turned out are seen to be greatly inflamed and granular, covered with vesicles and pustules.
With this inflammatory condition there is a sensation very commonly present in the Croton tig. eye cases, as if the eye were drawn backwards by a string, or as if the optic nerves were dragging the eyes backwards into the head.
This drawing in the back of the eye as with a string is also peculiar to Paris quadrifolia, but the conditions are different in Paris quad. In headaches from overuse of the eyes in engravers or those doing fine needle work, with much neuralgia in the head, due probably to the overuse of the eyes, when the pains in the eyes are not attended with inflammation, but are more of the type of dull aches and pains that you might call only rheumatic or neuralgic, with this sensation as if the eyes were drawl) back into the brain; in these neuralgic cases use Paris quad.
But in the inflammatory conditions such as I have described, with the same drawing back as with a string, Croton tig. is the remedy.
Troublesome eczema of the scalp in infants, either purely vesicular or intermingled more or less with pustules. The vesicles dry up and then desquamate, and now there is a red, raw, inflamed surface, sensitive to touch.
After desquamation has pretty nearly finished, a new crop of pustules and vesicles comes out, and while one place is clearing off another is vesicular. This is how it goes on with a chronic eczema. The eruptions are often about the eyes, on the temples, over the face and on top of the head.
The appearance is so nearly like Sepia that the two very often cannot be distinguished. Sepia has the same vesiculation intermingled with pustules, the bleeding and rawness of the surface and the eruption of new crops.
Sepia is more frequently indicated in this raw and bleeding state of the scalp, in crusta lactea, or the eruption of children that Crot. tig. Under Croton tig. infants in this state very often have attacks of gushing diarrhea, coming on from the slightest disturbance or indigestion; this is a great help in guiding to the remedy.
When the two groups of symptoms are combined, the scalp symptoms and the diarrhea, you can hardly make a mistake. You will see this also, that if the diarrhea is at all prolonged, the head will steadily improve and you will think your patient is getting well of the scalp trouble, but when the diarrhea slackens up a little out will come a fresh crop.
If the diarrhoea becomes chronic the external eruption will disappear, and if the diarrhea improves the external eruption gets worse. It seems necessary in such a constitution to have a vent. The mucous membrane is but the internal skin, and the integument of the body the external skin, and this remedy especially manifests itself upon one or the other of these, the mucous membrane or the integument.
Lactation: It has another manifestation that you want to carry in mind, a group of symptoms in relation to lactation. After confinement the mother may go on a little while with all things following normally, but all at once she commences to have pains in one or the other mammary gland, and the drawing as with a string comes up again.
It feels to her as if a string were attached behind the nipple pulling backward, a sharp, drawing, stinging pain that will in some instances keep her walking the floor night and day.
Though it is but a little thing it is a very important symptom to know with Croton tig. We see this drawing, as with a string, in the eye and in the breast, and also the symptom, very like the Plumbum symptom, drawing in the naval upon pressure, somewhat like a string.
Associating such things together will enable you to understand them as a part of the nature of the remedy and to keep them in mind. I once cured a woman of this painful drawing from the nipple as with a string. I watched her walk the floor and saw that the suffering must be very intense, for at times it brought tears to her eyes. She had borne it several nights, which shows that Croton tig. is capable of curing a pain that is very prolonged or tedious.
The breast had been poulticed, hot applications had been put upon it, and they did not give relief, a point which is worth remembering.
In cholera infantum, we will naturally have the symptoms of vomiting, which, however, are not so common to Croton tig., although it has some vomiting, So in cases of cholera infantum, in which the vomiting is not so important a feature as the loose bowels, the remedy may be Crot. tig.
A symptom is reported that is of great value. Excessive nausea with vanishing of sight, vertigo, worse after drinking, with frequent discharges of yellowish-green water from the bowels; excessive nausea, much water in the mouth. So we note the excessive nausea and not so great vomiting.
The nausea is more like that of Ipecac, but in Ipecac. we have nothing like the stools of Crot. tig., we have only scanty little gushes, every minute a little gush with tenesmus. Vomiting is the all important symptom in the cholera infantum of Ipecac., and when the stomach is emptied there is overwhelming retching and exhaustion from it, and the stools are scanty; but in Croton tig., the stools are copious and while there is nausea the vomit ing is seldom and scanty.
Another feature to be considered in this remedy is its relation to Rhus.
It is an antidote to Rhus. Croton tig. is closely related in its vesicular eruption to the Rhus family (particularly Rhus tox.). Anacardium, Sepia and Anagallis.
Skin: The eruptions of Croton tig. very often select as a location the genital organs. Rhus does the same, and when the genital organs are the principal seat of the eruptions in Rhus poisoning Croton tig. will commonly be its antidote; also when the eruptions are most about the eyes and scalp Croton tig. will often furnish an antidote.
When the symptoms, however, confine them selves to the palms of the hands Croton tig. is not the remedy, but it is Anagallis. Anagallis does upon the palms of the hands just what Croton tig. does upon the genitals. If you examine Anagallis you will find that the eruptions will come out and desquamate, and no sooner does the surface look as if it would heal than a new crop comes out. Rhus is similar in that it locates upon the palms of the, hands, but Rhus does not repeat itself. upon inflamed surfaces. In the Croton tig. eruption there is some burning, but nothing like that of Rhus.
The Rhus burning pain in eruptions that are marked is almost like fire. It is worse from the air, and it is better from dip ping the part in water as hot as it is possible to endure it. Persons who have these Rhus eruptions talk about scalding their hands to relieve the itching and burning.
So it is with Croton tig, but it is usually so sore he cannot touch it; when the eruption is so mild that he can handle it, we find that the slightest rubbing relieves the itching.
In Rhus touch aggravates the itching. In bad cases of Rhus poisoning he will hold his fingers far apart if they have very large blisters upon them, and he will not touch the place because it establishes a voluptuous itching that nearly drives him wild.
Although this is not so with Croton tig., still they are similar enough to each other to be antidotal; they do not have to be exactly alike, but they need to be similar.
It is true that remedies that are relieved by scratching are more nearly antidotal to such remedies as are relieved by scratching. The more similar the better; but medicines will antidote each other when they are similar only in general character, and they will cure disease when they are similar in general character.
It is also true that medicines while they are not similar in general character may be similar enough in special localities to remove the symptoms in these localities, while the disease will go on. The remedy in this case is not similar enough to cure the disease, but it has removed some of the symptoms. That is the most miserable kind of a prescription, as it changes the manifestations of the disease without changing its nature. In that way, a very poor prescription may hunt around and get one remedy for one group of
symptoms and another remedy for another group, and the patient be worse off than before. If the remedies are similar as to their general nature, then the little superficial symptoms are not so extremely important.
"Frequent, corrosive itching on glans and scrotum." "Vesicular eruption on scrotum and penis."
It is a remedy for vesicular and pustular eruptions upon the genital organs. It is closely related to Petroleum, which has fine red vesicular and granular elevations, intermingled with fine red rash upon the genitals, itching intensely, worse at times by scratching until burning comes on and then bleeding which relieves.
Cuprum Metallicum
Convulsions: Cuprum is pre-eminently a convulsive medicine. The convulsive tendency associates itself with almost every complaint that, Cuprum creates and cures.
It has convulsions in every degree of violence, from the mere twitching of little muscles and of single muscles to convulsions of all the muscles of the body. When these are coming on the earliest threatenings are drawings in the fingers, clenching of the thumbs or twitching of the muscles. It has twitching, quivering, trembling, and it has also tonic contractions, so that the hands are closed violently.
In this condition the thumbs are first affected; they are drawn into the palms and then the fingers close down over them with great violence. In the fingers and toes and in the extremities the spasmodic condition increases and extends until the limbs are in a state of great exhaustion. Tonic contractions, the limbs being drawn up with great violence and it seems as if the frame would be torn to pieces by the violent contractions of the muscles everywhere.
Mind: Often the contractions assume a clonic form, with jerking and twitching Cuprum has many mental symptoms. It has a great variety in its delirium, incoherent prattling, talking of all sorts of subjects incoherently. It has produced a variety of mental symptoms; delirium, incoherency of speech, loss of memory.
During its different complaints, such as cholera, some forms of fever, the puerperal state, dysmenorrhoea, congestion of the brain, etc., there is delirium, unconsciousness and jerking and twitching of the muscles.
The eyes roll in various directions, but commonly upwards and outwards or upwards and inwards. There is bleeding from the nose and the vision is disturbed. Between the convulsive attacks there is incoherent talk, delirium, during which the patient is spiteful, violent, weeping or shrieking. They go into convulsions with a shriek. In one place it is spoken of as bellowing like a calf.
This drug has the ability to produce a group of spasms followed by the appearance as if the patient were dead, or ina state of ecstacy. Convulsive conditions sometimes terminate in a state of stasis during which the mind ceases to act and the muscles remain quiet or only quiver.
This is often one of the leading features in whooping-cough when Cuprum is indicated. To bring it down to the language of the mother, the description which she gives of the little one, which will probably make you remember it better than if I use the text, she says that when the child is seized with a spell of this violent
whooping cough, the face, becomes livid or blue, the finger nails become discolored, the eyes are turned up, the child coughs until it loses its breath, and then lies in a state of insensibility for a long time until she fears the child will never breathe again, but with violent spasmodic action in its breathing, the child from shortest breaths comes to itself again just as if brought back to life.
Whooping cough: You have here all the violent features of a convulsive whooping-cough. In addition to what the mother says you may also observe a few things, but the whole make up of such a case, its whole nature, shows that it is a Cuprum whooping cough.
If the mother can get there quickly enough with a little cold water she will stop the cough. Cold water especially will relieve the spasm, and so the mother soon gets into the habit of hurry ing for a glass of cold water, and the child also knows, if it has tried once that glass of cold water will relieve it.
Whenever the respiratory organs are affected there is spasmodic breathing, dyspnoea. There is also rattling in the chest. The more dyspnoea there is the more likely his thumbs will be clenched and the fingers cramped.
In the lower part of the chest, in the region of the xiphoid appendix, there is a spasmodic condition that is very troublesome. It seems to be at times a constriction so severe that he thinks he will die, and at others a feeling as if he were transfixed with a knife from the xiphoid appendix to the back.
Some say it feels as if a lump were in that region and others as if much wind were collected in the stomach. It destroys the fullness of the voice, and it seems as if his life would be squeezed out. Sometimes then it takes the form of colic and sometimes of neuralgia.
If you examine the sensation of tightness in the region of the stomach you will see at once how the voice is affected. You will find the patient sitting up in bed; he tells you in a cracked and squeaking voice that he will soon die if he is not relieved; his face is a picture of fear and anguish he really looks as if he were going to die; the sensation is dreadful.
Cuprum speedily cures this complaint. This constriction and dyspnoea occur sometimes in cholera morbus and in painful menstruation. Spasms of the chest are also accompanied by this constriction and a nervous spasmodic breathing. He is not able to take a full breath.
Cramps: The Cuprum patient is full of cramps. There are cramps in the limbs and in the muscles of the chest, with trembling and weakness. In old age, and in premature old age, it is useful for those cramps that come in the calves, the soles of the feet, and the toes and fingers at night in bed.
In debilitated nervous, tremulous old people, Cuprum serves a peculiar purpose. When an old man, who has been single a long time marries, his cramps will sometimes prevent him performing the act of coition. He has cramps in the calves and soles as soon as he begins the act.
It is especially suitable to young men who have become prematurely old from vices, from strong drink, from late nights and various abuses, and these cramps are not unlikely to occur in such subjects.
Cuprum and Graphites are the two remedies for cramps coming under these circumstances, but whereas Cuprum is said to produce cramps that prevent the act, Graphites is said to bring on the cramps during the act. The two remedies however compete closely with each other, and hence if Graphites corresponds to the constitution of the patient, it should be given, and the same in regard to Cuprum. Sulphur also has cured this state.
Menstruation: In spasmodic conditions that come on during menstruation Cuprum is also useful. Painful menstruation with spasms commencing in the fingers and extending over the body. Tonic contractions that look like hysterical manifestations.
They may be hysterical, but that does not interfere with Cuprum curing, if they are only spasmodic or convulsive. Violent dysmenorrhoea with delirium, turning up of the eyes, contortions of the face and epileptiform manifestations.
In epilepsy calling for Cuprum we have the contractions and jerkings of the fingers and toes. He falls with a shriek and during the attack passes urine and faeces. It is indicated in epilepsy that begins with a violent constriction in the lower part of the chest as I have described, or with the contractions in the fingers that spread all over the body, to all the muscles.
Again, it is a remedy sometimes needed in the puerperal state before or after delivery. The case may be of uraemic character, but no matter; the urine is scanty and albuminous. During the progress of the labor the patient suddenly becomes blind.
All light seems to her to disappear from the room, the labor pains cease, and convulsions come on, commencing in the fingers and toes. When you meet these cases do not forget Cuprum. You will look a long time before you can cure a case of this kind without Cuprum.
Cholera: In cholera morbus with gushing, watery stools and copious vomiting, the stomach and bowels are emptied of their contents. The patient is fairly emptied out, becomes blue all over, the extremities are cold, there is jerking of the muscles, cramping of the extremities and of the fingers and toes, spasms of the chest; he is cold, mottled, blue in blotches, going into collapse; the finger nails and toe nails and the hands and feet are blue.
There are several remedies that look like Cuprum in such a condition. In cholera we would naturally hunt for such remedies as produce cholera-like discharges, more or less spasmodic conditions, the great blueness, coldness, sinking and collapse.
We would here refer to Hahnemann's observation. Hahnemann had not seen a case of cholera, but he perceived that the disease produced appearances resembling the symptoms of Cuprum, Camphor and Veratrum. He saw from the description of the disease that the general aspect of cholera was like the general aspect of Cuprum, Camphor and Veratrum, and these three remedies are the typical cholera remedies.
They all have the general feature of cholera, its nature and general aspect. They all have the exhaustive vomiting and diarrhoea, the coldness, the tendency to collapse, the sinking from the emptying out of the fluids of the body.
From what I have said you will see that the Cuprum case is, above all others, the spasmodic case. It has the most intense spasms, and the spasms being the leading feature, they overshadow all the other symptoms of the case.
He is full of cramps and is compelled to cry out with the pain from the contractions of the muscles. Camphor is the coldest of all the three remedies; the Camphor patient is cold as death. Camphor has the blueness, the exhaustive discharge, though less than Cuprum and Veratrum; but whereas in the two latter remedies the patient is willing to be covered up, in Camphor he wants the windows open and wants to be cool.
Though he is cold he wants to be uncovered and to have the windows open. But just here let me mention another feature in Camphor. It has also some convulsions which are painful, and when the pain is on he wants to be covered up and wants the windows shut. If there are cramps in the bowels with the pain, be wants to be covered up.
So that in Camphor, during all of its complaints in febrile conditions (and fever is very rare in Camphor), and during the pains he wants to be covered up and warm, but during the coldness he wants to be uncovered and have the air.
In cholera, then, the extreme coldness and blueness point to Camphor.
Again, with Camphor there are often scanty as well as copious discharges, so that the cholera patient is often taken so suddenly that he has the coldness, blueness and exhaustion and almost no vomiting or diarrhoea, a condition called dry cholera. It simply means an uncommonly small amount of vomiting and diarrhoea.
This is Camphor. Another prominent feature is the great coldness of the body without the usual sweat that belongs to the disease. Cuprum and Veratrum have the cold clammy sweat, and Camphor also has sweat, but more commonly the patient needing Camphor is very cold, blue and dry and wants to be uncovered. That is striking.
Now we go to Veratrum and see that we can have three remedies very much alike, and so perfectly adapted to cholera and yet so different. Veratrum is peculiar because of its copious exhaustive discharges, copious sweat, copious discharges from the bowels, copious vomiting, and great coldness of the sweat. There is some cramping and he wants to be warm; he is ameliorated by hot drinks, and by the application of hot bottles which relieve pain and suffering.
These three remedies tend downward into collapse and death. Now to repeat: Cuprum for the cases of a convulsive character, Camphor in cases characterized by extreme coldness and more or less dryness, and Veratrum when the copious sweat, vomiting and purging are the features. That is little to remember, but with that you can enter an epidemic of cholera with confidence.
In cholera-like states there are other remedies which relate to Cuprum and which ought to be considered. Podophyllum has cramps, mainly in the bowels. It has a painless, gushing diarrhea with vomiting as well, and hence is useful in cholera morbus.
The cramps in Podophyllum, are violent, they feel to him as if the intestines were being tied in knots. The watery stool is yellow, and, if examined a little while after, it looks as if corn meal had been stirred into it. The odor is dreadful, smelling like a Podophyllum, stool. If you say it smells like stinking meat that only partly describes it; it is not quite cadaveric but it is horribly offensive and penetrating.
The stool is gushing, copious, and is accompanied by dreadful exhaustion.
"It is a wonder where it can all come from,” says the mother, speaking of the exhausting diarrhea in an infant or in a child. The stool runs away gushingly, in prolonged squirts, with a sensation of emptiness, sinking, deathly goneness in the whole abdomen. Phosphorus also ought to be thought of in relation to Cuprum. It also has cramps in the bowels, exhaustive diarrhea, a, sinking as if dying, but commonly with heat of the skin, with burning internally, with gurgling of all the fluids taken into the stomach; as soon as they come to the stomach they commence to gurgle, and gurgle all the way through the bowel.
A drink of water seems to, flow through the bowel with a gurgle. Now this gurgling in Cuprum commences at the throat; he swallows with a gurgle; gurgling in the oesophagus when swallowing.
Convulsive cramps all over the body with twitching, jerking, trembling and blueness of the skin. Everything he does, all his actions are spasmodic, are convulsive. All the sphincters are convulsive, All the activities are irregular, disorderly and convulsive when poisoned with copper.
Bear these things in mind as we study every region in Cuprum. Repression or driving in of eruptions, attended with diarrhoea and convulsions, sometimes only convulsions. We note a case of measles or scarlet fever with a rash that has been suppressed by a chill or exposure to wind and convulsions have come on.
That belongs to Zincum and Cuprum, sometimes to Bryonia, but to Zincum and Cuprum particularly. Twitching of the limbs from a sudden suppression of a scarlet fever, with suppression of urine, chorea, etc.
Cramping of the muscles of the chest; cramping of the calves; cramp ing all over. Suppressed eruptions. Discharges that have been in existence quite a long time. The individual has become debilitated and worn out with excitement, but this discharge barely kept him alive. He has gradually grown weaker, but he has kept about because he had a discharge.
It has furnished him a safety-valve, If stopped suddenly convulsions will come on. That is like Cuprum. A woman has suffered a long time with a copious leucorrhoea and some unwise doctor tells her she must take injections and she checks it up for a few days, hysterical convulsions, crampings and tearings of the muscles come on; contractions of the fingers and toes. Discharges from old ulcers, fistulae suppressed.
Cuprum will re-establish a discharge that has been suddenly suppressed and convulsions followed. It stops the convulsions and reestablishes the discharge. It has caries, it has senile gangrene, or the gangrene that belongs to old age; old shriveled up octogenarians, whose toes and fingers get dark in spots; feeble circulation.
Mind: In the Cuprum patient the nerves are all the time wrought up to the highest tension; wants to fly, wants to do something dreadful.
Impulsiveness. Compelled to do something; restless and tossing about a constant uneasiness; nervous trembling; always tired. Great weakness of the muscles, and relaxation of the body when the convulsions are not on.
Twitching and jerking and starting during sleep. Grinding of the teeth with brain affections. Inflammations ceases suddenly and you wonder what has happened. All at once comes on insanity, delirium, convulsions, blindness; evidence of cerebral congestions and inflammation appearing with wonderful suddenness. Metastasis. A perfect change from one part of the body to another.
The same thing may occur from a suppressed eruption, or suppressed discharge, or a suppressed diarrhoea, and it goes to the brain affects the mind and brings on insanity; a wild, active, maniacal delirium.
Cuprum is not passive in its business. Violence is manifested everywhere. Violence in i ts diarrhoea, violence in its vomiting, violence in its spasmodic action; strange and violent things in its mania and delirium.
Hysterical cramps and hysterical attitudes may change in a night or in a day to St. Vitus' dance, and go on with it as if nothing had happened. Such is the suddenness with which it changes its character. This is not
generally known of Cuprum - this constant changing about. Spasmodic affections in general. Spasmodic coughs, spasms all over the body.
Chest: The face becomes purple. He loses his breath; suffocated. The mother thinks the child will never come to life again. Spasms of the chest; spasms of the larynx; spasms of the whole respiratory system of such a character that the child seems to be choking to death.
Whooping cough. With every spell of whooping cough comes this awful spasmodic state, this spasmodic coughing. Jerking of the muscles. Cuprum has spasms of the limbs with all sorts of contractions such as are found in hysterical constitutions.
Puerperal convulsions. Convulsions where a limb will first flex and then extend an alternation of flexion and extension. In a child you will see the leg all at once shoot out with great violence, then up against the abdomen again with great violence, and then again shoot out. It is hard work to find another remedy that has that. Tabacum has it, but not many others. Convulsions with flexion and extension are common to Cuprum. Convulsions of the limbs, twitching and jerking of the muscles. We get a part of the symptom- picture in one and part in another.
Head: Violent congestion in the head, violent pains in the head. Tingling pain in the vertex, severe pain in the vertex, bruised pain. Crawling sensation in vertex, stitches in the temples. Congestion of the brain, Meningitis. Headache after epileptic attacks. Paralysis of the brain with symptoms of collapse. Metastasis to the brain from other organs.
About the face; convulsions, jerking of the eyes; twitching of the lids. Bruised pain in the eyes. Spasms of the muscles of the eye so, that the eyes jerk and twitch, first from one side and then the other. Rolling of the eyes.
"Quick rotation of the balls with the lids closed.
Lids spasmodically closed"
Closed so that they seem to snap.
"Inflammation of the periosteum about the eyes and cellular tissue of the lachrymal glands."
Spots of ulceration on the cornea, Face and lips blue. The face is purple in convulsions and whooping cough; lips blue.
Inflammation of the tongue. Paralysis of the tongue, It is not an uncommon thing to find paralysis in Cuprum after convulsions, The violence of the convulsions seems to have brought about a re action and paralytic weakness, a numbness and tingling, a loss of motility.
"Spasms of the throat, preventing speech. Sensation as if constricted on swallowing.
Great thirst for cold drinks."
Many complaints are ameliorated by drinking cold water. The spasms are sometimes mitigated by drinking cold water. The cough is brought on sometimes by inhaling cold air, but stopped by drinking cold water, like Coccus cacti.
"Desire for warm food and drinks. Eats hastily."
Indigestion from milk. Then there is nausea, vomiting and diarrhea connected more or less with spasms. Spasms of the stomach. Spasms of the chest with diarrhea and vomiting. Cramps of the calves and the fingers and toes.
"Pressure in the stomach."
In the stomach and bowels periodical cramps. Cramps coming periodically. It has cured colic in the form of violent cramps coming every two weeks with perfect regularity. It has pain in the stomach, and a pain under the xiphoid appendix that seems as if it would take his life. If it is not removed he will certainly die in a little while.
Constriction across the chest, suffocation, cramps of the legs. Cuprum goes deep into the life, and it has many a time taken such a grand hold of an old hysterical subject that it has completely eradicated in a short time the hysterical tendency to cramps.
In Cuprum particularly, early in the cramps the thumbs commence to draw down. It is with difficulty that they can be lifted up. They will draw back again, and then the fingers will clinch over them and draw so tightly it is painful. In children with such convulsions, and in hysterics with such convulsions, Cuprum goes deep into the life and eradicates this tendency to convulsions and cramps. Uraemic convulsions. Convulsions with suppressed or scanty urine.
No urine in the bladder. in young girls beginning to menstruate, violent cramps in the limbs, cramps in the abdomen, diarrhoea, cramps in the uterus. Epileptic spasms coming at every menstrual period. Before or during menses, or after suppression, violent, unbearable cramps in the abdomen. A case something like this is not so very uncommon.
Women: Girls, at about the time of puberty, go in bathing, when their mothers have been a little too prudish, a little too sensitive, and have not told their daughters what they might expect, and to look out for bathing in cold water at certain times. The menstrual flow starts. From a cold bath she suppresses that flow and on come convulsions.
That is in keeping with Cuprum. Hysterical convulsions they may be called. They will take the form, quite likely, of hysterical convulsions; they may take the form of chorea. Instead of convulsions it may take the form of congestion of the brain with violent delirium.
Again, the menses not appearing after suppression, after sweat, and convulsions come on; frequent spasms during menses. Cuprum is not generally known to be such a wonderful medicine where there is anaemia; but it has chlorosis. It is a deep acting medicine. It affects with great power the whole voluntary system, the desires and aversions.
It is suitable in those girls who have always had their own way, have never been crossed, and when they grow older, and reach puberty, and have got to submit to some sort of discipline or never become women,
they have mad fits, have cramps. Cuprum will sometimes make them sensible, so in that way it fits into the loves and hates. It belongs to the voluntary system most prominently.
Spasmodic respiration; great dyspnea, asthmatic breathing. Attacks of spasmodic asthma and most violent spasmodic coughs.
"Dry, hard, difficult cough, rattling in the chest, spasms. Dry spasmodic cough until he suffocates.
Face is red or purple."

Digitalis History: This drug as used by the Old School has done more mischief than any one drug in their Materia
Medica. Every patient who had a fast heart, or anything the matter with the heart, was given Digitalis.
It has caused more deaths than any drug. If administered when the heart is going fast it will soon produce a peculiar kind of paralysis; the heart then having lost its balance-wheel, compensation gives out, the patient sinks and finally dies.
They do not know that many patients would have lived through fevers, pneumonia and other acute diseases if it had not been for this medicine, used as they have used it in the tincture, in many-drop doses, until the
heart was slowed down.
They call it sedative; yes, it is a sedative. It makes the patient very sedate. You have seen how very sedate a patient looks after he has been in the hands of an undertaker and has on his best garments. That is what Digitalis does. In that way it is a sedative in the hands of the allopath. A homoeopathic physician never prescribes to bring down the pulse. He prescribes for the patient and the heart's action takes care of itself. Digitalis is a very poor fever medicine. Instead of being indicated when the pulse is fast, the proving says it
is indicated when the pulse is slow. The allopath gives it when the pulse is fast to make it slow; if given toa well person it will make the pulse slow, and when indicated in a sick person the pulse is slow.
Liver: It produces a great disturbance of the liver. "Congestion and enlargement of the liver. Soreness of the liver."
Tenderness about the liver-but during that time the pulse is slow. It makes the bowels very sluggish, produces inactivity of the liver, and stools are bileless, light colored, putty-like-and the pulse is slow.
Add to that jaundice and you have a grand picture of Digitalis: jaundice with slow pulse, with uneasiness in
the liver, pale stool, and even if you have never seen or beard of Digitalis before you will scarcely miss it. Now, you might add a myriad of little symptoms, but it does not change the aspect of things. It is Digitalis.
Stomach: Another group of symptoms that belongs with the Digitalis heart, the Digitalis liver and the Digitalis bowels, is a gone, sinking feeling in the stomach. It seems as if be would die, and he does not get better from eating. It is a nervous, deathly sinking that comes with many heart troubles.
You would not be surprised to find in Digitalis much nervous prostration. Restlessness and great nervous weakness.
"Feels as if would fly to pieces. Anxiety.
Feels that something is going to happen."
Seems as if his whole economy were full of anxious feelings and restlessness. Lassitude, faintness exhaustion and extreme prostration. Faints on the slightest provocation. It begins in the stomach; an awful sensation of weakness in the stomach and bowels.
Sleep: His sleep is full of horrible dreams, nightmare, fright. Dreams of falling, that is very common with cardiac affections. When the pulse is too slow, when it is irregular, the brain is irregularly supplied with blood during sleep, and there is a turbulent state.
A shock goes through the body like an electric shock, like internal jerkings, twitchings. Sudden muscular movements, as if a current of electricity passed through the body. This, with slow pulse, with a sense of faintness, and great weakness. Bluish paleness of the lips in persons who suffer at times with cardiac spells - it seems at times as if the pulse would cease. Face becomes blue, the fingers become blue. Wants to lie on the back. Frequently startled in sleep; jerking at night.
The heart symptoms are numerous, but none is so important as the slow pulse. The pulse is slow in the beginning of the case. It may now be flying like lighting.
Pulse: He is anxious, restless, has horrible dreams and sinking in the stomach - that sounds like the advanced stage of Digitalis - but I want to know if in the beginning, the pulse was slow.
The patient himself seldom knows, but someone says that in the beginning the pulse was 48; that is Digitalis. If the pulse in the beginning was rapid do not think of Digitalis, for it will not do any good.
The Digitalis pulse is at first slow and perhaps remains so for many days, until finally the heart commences to go with a quiver, with an irregular beat, intermits, feels as if it would cease to beat, and then we have all these strange manifestations.
Weakness is the very character of the Digitalis pulse, and all these characteristics go along with it. First it is slow, and sometimes strong. Slow, strong pulse when rheumatism is threatening the heart.
"Violent. but not very rapid pulse.
Sudden violent beating of the heart, with disturbed rhythm."
The slightest motion increases anxiety and palpitation. When the pulse is going very slow, sometimes down to 40, the patient turns the head and the pulse flutters and increases in its action. If he turns over in bed it seems as if the heart would stop. If he moves he feels it fluttering all over him, and it settles back and is
slow again; but, finally, it changes and flutters all the time.
Palpitation of the heart originating in grief. Sudden sensation as though the heart stood still. Fluttering of the heart, The least muscular exertion renders the heart's action labored and intermittent in a feeble heart.
Cough: A person with an enlarged liver, with a slow pulse, with jaundice and pale and stool. With that he will have a troublesome cough. Digitalis is not much of a remedy for a cough unless it is a cardiac cough.
Cough at midnight. Cough, with expectoration of "boiled starch.” Cough, with expectoration of bloody mucus in hypostatic congestion of the lungs.
Cough, brought on by talking, walking, drinking anything cold, bending the body. These are coughs associated with other troubles.
Respiration: The same thing is to be said of the respiration. There are difficulties of respiration, along with cardiac troubles and liver troubles.
"Respiration irregular and performed with great difficulty. Constant desire to take a deep breath.
When he goes to sleep the breath seems to fade away, then he wakes up with a gasp. Lachesis, Phosphorus, Carbo veg. and some other remedies have that; remedies that affect the cerebellum particularly, producing a congestion of the cerebellum.
When a patient goes to sleep the cerebrum says to the cerebellum: "Now you carry on this breathing a little while, I am getting tired."
But the cerebellum is not equal to the occasion. It is congested, and just as soon as the cerebrum begins to rest the cerebellum goes to sleep, too, and lets the patient suffer; and in that way we get suffocation. The cerebellum presides over respiration during sleep and the cerebrum presides over respiration when the patient is awake. We might learn that from the provings of medicines if we never found it before.
"Fear of suffocation at night."
Now, to analyze that. He knows from experience that every time he drops into a sleep he suffocates, and hence he fears to go to sleep for fear he will suffocate. The fear of suffocation at night is from this origin. It is the same if he falls asleep in the day time.
"Can only breathe in gasps."
Digitalis is a useful medicine when there is a filling up of the lower part of thy lungs. The patient is sitting up in bed, and there is dullness in the lower part of each lung and plenty of resonance in the upper portion. Then it is, if he lies down, he will suffocate. Digitalis likes mostly to lie flat on the back with no pillow, when there is no filling up of the lungs. But when there is hypostatic congestion he suffocates. If early in the case the pulse was slow and it has become fast, Digitalis may be of some benefit.
Urinary organs: Now, a feature in connection with the genito-urinary organs. In old cases of enlarged prostate gland I do not know what I would do without Digitalis. Where there is a constant teasing to pass urines.
In many instances where the catheter has been used for months or years because he is unable to pass urine in a natural way, and where there is a residuary urine in old bachelors and old men, Digitalis is a good remedy.
It diminishes the size of the prostate gland and has many times cured. "Dropsy with suppression of urine.”
In uraemic poisoning and in various phases of Bright's disease of the kidneys we have symptoms indicating Digitalis. Retention of urine; dribbling of urine. Spermatorrhea, Nightly emission. In persons addicted for years to secret vices. Enlarged prostate gland.
It is capable of curing chronic gonorrhoea. It has cured acute gonorrhea. It has cured inflammation of that thin, delicate membrane covering the glans penis. Dropsical swelling of the genitals.
Food: "Loss of appetite and violent thirst." Most doctors give Sulphur when the patient drinks much and eats little. The nausea of Digitalis is not like that of Ipecac. and Bryonia. It is a singular nausea. The smell of food excites a deathly nausea, a sinking, a
goneness, associated with cardiac troubles, with Jaundice and liver troubles.
The nausea is accompanied by a deathly feeling, as if be is sinking away. Sometimes the nausea is relieved by eating, but the sinking remains after eating, showing that it is something besides hunger.
"Persistent nausea.
Extreme sensitiveness, in the pit of the stomach.
Faintness and sinking in the pit of the stomach as if be would die.
No appetite, but great thirst.
Soreness and hardness in the region of the liver.
Sensitiveness to pressure in the region of the liver."
Now remember the liver and the heart symptoms, the jaundice, the slow pulse, the awful sinking in the stomach, the enlargement of the prostate gland, the gray stool, and you have the principal symptoms of Digitalis.
After all that I have said you are not surprised at the horrible anxiety that the Digitalis patient carries with him all the time.
He wants to be alone; sadness, melancholy, despondency and restlessness. He can’t decide upon anything that be ought to do; tremulousness.
The stomach, bowel and liver troubles are just what you see sometimes in a hard drinker after trying to break off. He is prostrated; his heart gives out, is irregular, weak, slow; and he has sadness and melancholy; inability to apply himself. Digitalis will help him straighten out.
Drosera Rotundifolia
Generalities: The use of this medicine has been mostly limited to whooping cough, but it has a more extensive use.
When we examine its spasmodic nature, its exhaustion, its cramps, which extend through a large number of complaints, we must realize that it is a more extensive remedy. Epileptiform spasms, prolonged sleeplessness, copious sweat on waking from sleep, restlessness and anxiety. imagines that he is constantly persecuted. Flashes of heat, dread of the night. Many complaints come on in the night. Anxiety,
sleeplessness, and fear of ghosts. Spasmodic cough. Fear of being alone and suspicious of his most intimate friends.
Confusion of mind and much dizziness. Lancinating pains in various parts of the body, especially in the head, and must support the head with the hands.
Must support the chest when coughing. Must press upon the abdomen. Pressive, congestive headaches. Corrosive itching in various parts of the body with measles -like eruptions. The eyeballs become prominent and congested from coughing during measles and in convulsions. Stitching pain in the eyes. Noises in the ears, roaring, bumming and drumming. Earache in children. Stitching in the ears. Bleeding from various orifices, especially from the nose, throat, larynx, and chest when coughing, in connection with the spasmodic coughs.
Face: Ordinarily the face is pale and sunken with beat of the face and he has cold extremities, except when coughing, at which time the face becomes red, congested, and purple like Bell. and Cupr. Stitching pains will be found in many complaints.
Putrid taste in the mouth is a common symptom when it is found in phtisical conditions of the lungs, larynx, and also in whooping cough. Bloody saliva and hemorrhage from the mouth. Difficulty in swallowing solid foods.
Constriction of the throat and of the larynx and constriction of the oesophagus preventing swallowing. Cramping constriction runs all through the remedy. Cramping of the hands upon undertaking to hold on to something. When grasping the broom handle.
In the throat there is burning and scraping. Stitching pains in the throat. The throat is dark red or purple. I believe that Drosera has a clinical symptom of great value. Scraping hi the larynx and cough after eating. In its proving it has cough after drinking. It has especially cough after eating and drinking cold things. This cough comes from tickling in the larynx and constrictions in the larynx. Nausea and vomiting. Vomiting of blood and bile in the morning and vomiting of mucus, and food when coughing. Coughing until he retches and vomits.
Constricting pains in the pit of the stomach. Constricting pains in the sides of the abdomen. Colic after sour food. Perhaps the most troublesome irritation found in this remedy is in the larynx, where there will be found clutching, cramping, constricting, and burning.
Larynx: Hoarseness and continued irritation causing coughing and continued irritation and scraping of the larynx. Accumulation of mucus in the larynx, dryness in the larynx, spasms of the epiglottis. Violent spasmodic cough from tickling in the larynx.
Violent tickling in the larynx brings on cough, rousing him from sleep, coming on every few hours with increasing intensity making the remedy resemble whooping cough, in which it has been very useful. Sensation in the larynx like a feather. Spasms of the larynx. Spasms of the extremities when coughing. The cough is brought on from tickling, from accumulation of mucus in the larynx.

Dulcamara
(Bitter Sweet)
This medicine seems especially to affect the mucous membranes. It appears to have a tendency to establish or ultimate discharges, both acute and chronic.
Modalities: The Dulcamara patient is disturbed by every change in the weather, from warm to cold, from dry to moist, and from suddenly cooling the body while perspiring. He is ameliorated in dry, even weather; cold and damp aggravate all the conditions. He is worse evening and night and during rest.
Diarrhea: Dulcamara produces catarrh of the stomach, intestines, nose, eyes, cars, and inflammatory conditions of the skin with eruptions. If you go through any of these in detail, you will be astonished to find how disturbed is the constitutional state of this patient by weather changes.
It is a medicine wonderfully useful in diarrhoea, at the close of the summer, hot days and cold nights, with changeable stool; diarrhoea of infants. There seems to be no digestion; yellow, slimy stool; yellow-green stool, with undigested stool; frequent stool, blood in the stool and quite a mass of slime, showing a marked catarrhal state.
This gets better and worse; this gets better under ordinary remedies; it will often get better from Pulsatilla, because Pulsatilla symptoms seem to predominate, and sometimes it is relieved by Arnica; but every time the child takes cold, it comes back again, and soon the physician will realize that he has not struck the remedy belonging to all the symptoms. It is very often an annoying condition, because the symptoms are not recognized until two or three attacks have come. It is not easy to discover that the attacks come on from cold.
Babies: Every year women bring their babies back from the mountains, at the end of the season, and then we get some Dulcamara cases. One needs to be in the mountains at the close of the summer season to know what the condition is.
If you go into the mountains at such a time, either in the North or West, you will notice that the sun's rays beat down during the day with great force, but along towards sunset if you walk out a draft of cold air comes down that will chill you to the bone.
This will make the baby sick; it is too warm to take the child out in the middle of the day, and so he is taken out in his carriage in the evening; he has been overheated in the house during the day, and then catches this draft in the evening.
Dulcamara is suitable for conditions that would arise from just such a state. So with an adult who has been out in the beat of the sun and catches the cold draft by night, which means hot days and cold nights, such as occur in the fall of the year, at the close of the summer and coming in of the winter; this intermingling of hot air and cold drafts.
You go up towards the foot of the hills after a hot day, you will walk through a stratum of air that will make you perspire and the next minute a cold air that will make you want your overcoat on, and then again a stratum of hot air and so on.
Such a state will bring out a sweat and then suppress it. The symptoms that come from Dulcamara seem to be like symptoms that arise from just such causes. And we are free, then, to infer from such an experience that Dulcamara cures these cases.
I have been puzzled in times past over these babies that have been brought home from the mountains, and have prescribed upon the visible symptoms, until I thought about the matter carefully and figured it out that they had come from these hot and cold regions.
Babies have to be hurried home at times, because of the diarrheas that cannot be cured in the mountains, but a dose of Dulcamara will enable them to stay there and live right in that same climate. Chronic recurrent dysentery from cold. If they have a dose of Dulcamara it fortifies them against the continual taking of cold.
Diarrhea: There are people in a certain kind of business that really constitute a Dulcamara state. Suppose we look at our ice-cream men and our ice handlers and cold storage men; in a cold room they are handling ice; the summer weather is hot, they must go out and take some of the heat, and then they go back into their cold rooms and handle the ice. I have seen these things and have had occasion to follow them out.
These men are subject at times to bowel troubles, and other catarrhal affections, but generally to diarrheic affections.
Their business cannot stop because it is their means of living. Dulcamara cures such chronic diarrheas when the symptoms agree. Arsenicum is a medicine that would be suitable for such patients if the symptoms agreed, but the symptoms at times agree with Dulcamara, for that is the nature of the remedy, to take cold from cold, damp place flora suppressing a sweat, from going out of a hot atmosphere into an ice house, into icy rooms; into cold rooms; in this climate such complaints as come on from overexertion, overheating, and then throwing off the clothing and becoming chilled, suppressing the sweat; fevers may come on, aching in the bones, trembling with the aching, trembling in the muscles, and as the fever goes on, he is ina distressed state, cannot remember, forgets what he was about to speak of, forgets the word that would naturally express his idea, and he enters into a dazed state, a state of confusion.
It suits these colds that have this sluggish circulation of the brain, with trembling and chilliness, coldness as if in the bones.
Rheumatism: Dulcamara is full of rheumatism, full of rheumatic pains and aches, sore and bruised all over, the joints are inflamed, become red, sensitive to touch and are swollen. It is suitable, in cases of inflammatory rheumatism, due to suppressed perspiration, induced by changing from a high to low temperature, or from cold wet weather. Worse evening and night and during rest.
Now, it has many chronic complaints. A catarrhal condition of the eyes, purulent discharges, thick, yellow discharges, granular lids; eyes become red every time he takes cold;
"every time he takes cold it settles in the eyes,” is a common expression of the patient. The patient will often ask the question,
"Why is it, doctor, that every time I take cold it settles in my eyes? If I get into a cold atmosphere, or take off my coat after being heated, I have to look out."
If it becomes cold in the night and he has thrown the clothes off, he takes cold, or, if'a cold rain comes on, he takes cold and then has sore eyes.
Such eyes are very often effectually cured by Dulcamara. As to the eye itself, it is only an ordinary catarrhal state, but the manner in which it comes on is the important thing. That is the nature of the patient to have sore eyes whenever he takes cold; it belongs to some other remedies as well, but this one particularly.
Nose: Dulcamara has also catarrhal discharges from the nose, with bloody crusts; blowing out thick, yellow mucus all the time.
In infants and children who have sniffles, they are always worse in cold, damp weather. When the patient says:
"Doctor, in cold, damp weather I cannot breathe through my nose; my nose stuffs up;” or, "I must sleep with my mouth open."
Dulcamara is a very useful remedy to know in catarrhal cases that always stuff up when there is a cold rain.
It is markedly an autumnal remedy. The Dulcamara patients go through the summer very comfortably; their catarrhal conditions to a great extent pass away; the warm days and warm nights, because of the even temperature seem to agree with them, but as soon as the cold nights come on and the cold rains come, all their difficulties return; there is an increase of the rheumatism and of the catarrhal discharges.
This medicine has been used a long time by our mothers. They used to make ointments out of Dulcamara. You will find that the old lady, in almost any rural district in which Dulcamara grows, gather it and make it into a salve for ulcers. Well, it is astonishing how soothing it is when applied externally to smarting wounds, whether in solution or salve or any other way. But it is a better medicine, of course, when indicated by symptoms of the constitutional state; it is a better medicine if used internally.
Ulcers: It produces ulcers and a tendency to ulceration of the mucous membranes and this condition will become phagedenic. Sometimes it starts as nothing more than an herpetic eruption, but it spreads and finally yellow pus forms and then the granulations that should come, do not come; an eating condition appears and the surface does not heal.
Especially along the shin bone there will be raw places, which even extend to the periosteum, to the bone, producing necrosis and caries; so we have affections of the mucous membranes or skin, first becoming vesiculated and then breaking open and eating.
It is especially related to very sensitive, bleeding ulcers with false granulations, phagedenic ulcers. This is not generally known; it is a matter of experience with those that have watched this medicine; and again, strange to say, Arsenicum, which I have already mentioned once or twice, has this state. Arsenicum leads all other medicines for ulcers that eat, phagedenic ulcers. Arsenicum is a typical remedy for spreading sores, for spreading ulcers, and especially those that come from a bubo that has opened and will not heal.
Skin: Another feature of this medicine is its tendency to throw out eruptions over the body. It is a wonderfully eruptive medicine, producing vesicles, crusts, dry, brown crusts, humid crusts, herpes. Dulcamara produces eruptions so nearly like impetigo that it has been found a useful remedy in that condition. i.e., multiple little boil-like eruptions; it produces little boils, and the boils spread.
Enlargement and hard ness of the glands. Eruptions upon the scalp that look so much like crusta lactea that Dulcamara has been found a very useful medicine. Extreme soreness, itching, and the itching is not I relieved by scratching, and the scratching goes on, until bleeding - and rawness take place.
Eruptions that come out upon the face, upon the forehead, all over the nose, but especially on the cheeks, which become completely covered with these crusts; eczema of infants. Children only a few weeks old break out with these scalp eruptions, and Dulcamara is one of the medicines that you will need to know.
It is about as frequently indicated as any of the medicines. Sepia, Arsenicum, Graphites, Dulcamara, Petroleum, Sulphur and Calcarea are about equally indicated, but of these, in this climate at least, I think Sepia is probably more frequently indicated.
All of these catarrhal symptoms, the rheumatic symptoms, the eruptions upon the skin, are subject to the peculiar aggravations of the constitutional state. No matter what the symptoms are, the constitutional state is worse in cold, damp weather.
"Catarrhal and rheumatic headaches in cold, damp weather."
Headache: When the headache is the main trouble, the catarrh takes a different course from what it does when the catarrh is the principal ailment. There are two ways in which that conducts itself. In some Dulcamara patients, whenever he takes cold from the cold, damp weather, he commences to sneeze, and to get a coryza, and soon comes a copious, thick, yellow flow from the nose.
On the other hand, Dulcamara has a dry catarrh in its first stage, and a fluid catarrh only in the second stage.
One who is subject to Dulcamara headaches, has the dry catarrh; whenever he takes cold instead of the usual catarrhal flow with it, he at first sneezes and then feels a dryness in the air passages, a slacking up of the usual discharge, which would give him relief, and then he knows that he must look out, for along will come the neuralgic pains, pains in the occiput, and finally over the whole head. Congestive headaches, with neuralgic pains and dry nose.
Every spell of cold, damp weather will bring on that headache. The catarrh is not always acute enough for him to pay attention to it. He does not say very much about it. The Dulcamara headache is very severe, is accompanied by tremendous pains, and he may go to the doctor with the idea of getting rid of the headache, but it is a catarrhal state that is suppressed, that has slackened up, and the nose becomes dry.
As soon as the flow starts up his headache is relieved. Then headache of this catarrhal kind that comes on from every cold, damp spell, or from getting overheated, from getting into a cold draft after being overheated, or get ting overheated with too much clothing, and then throwing the coat off, will also belong to the Dulcamara state.
A form of eruption that is very likely to be a Dulcamara eruption is the ringworm, herpes circinatus. It comes sometimes upon the face and scalp. Children sometimes have ringworms in the hair. Dulcamara will nearly always cure these ringworms in the hair.
Ear: The Dulcamara child is very susceptible to earache.
"Coryza dry, relieved by motion, worse during rest, and renewed by the slightest exposure, and worse in cold air."
Some coryzas cannot tolerate the warm room, and others want a warm room. The Dulcamara coryza is worse going out in the open air and better from motion. The Nux vomica coryza is better in the open air. The patient feels much aching distress in the nose. The Nux vomica patient ordinarily wants warmth and warm air and a warm room, but with the coryza he is the very opposite; he wants motion in the open air, he looks for cool air, for it relieves the distressing sensation.
In the warm room there is a tickling sensation in the nose, and the nose will drip, night and day. The Nux vomica coryza is worse in the house, and worse in the night, and worse in the warm bed, so that the discharge will run all over the pillow.
In Dulcamara it is more fluent in the house, in the warmth, and less fluent in the cold air in a cold room. With the Dulcamara coryza, if the patient should go into a cold room pain will commence in the nasal bones and he will begin to sneeze, and water will be discharged from the nose. That very state would relieve a Nux vomica patient. Allium cepa is made worse in a warm room; like Nux vomica, is better in cold, open air. Commences to sneeze as soon as he gets into a warm room. So that we see the meaning of such things, the necessity of going into particulars and examining every case.
Here is a state that you will often find in the fall of the year, somewhere about August 20 th. They sometimes call it hay fever. Every year as the nights become cold, and there is cold, damp weather and fall rains, he has a stuffing up of the nose with constant sneezing and wants the nose kept warm.
I have known these cases at times to sit ina warm room with cloths, wrung out of hot water, over the face and nose to relieve the distress, the catarrhal state of the eyes and the stuffing up of the nose. Heat relieves the stuffing up of the nose.
These patients can sometimes breathe with these hot cloths over the nose, but if they go out into the night air, or a cold place, and especially if there is a damp, fall rain, they suffer much. Other cases of hay fever suffer during the day, and they go to as cold a place as they can find, and are even driven to the mountains for a cool place.
These things are indicative of a state of the constitution; the state gives out signs and symptoms to lead the intelligent physician to cure. If that state had no means of making itself known by signs and symptoms, there could be no curing it by remedies.
"Profuse discharge of water from the nose and eyes, worse in the open air,” "better in a closed room, on awakening in the morning, " etc.
The Dulcamara patient is so sensitive to newly mown grass and drying weeds, that he is obliged to absent himself from the country where they are found.
Hay-fever: For hay fever we have especially to look up such remedies as have complaints worse in the fall of the year. There are other conditions that are just as much hay fever, for instance, "rose cold" that comes on in June.
There are other conditions that come on in the spring, sometimes cured by Naja and Lachesis. So that we have to observe the time of the year, the time of the day, night or day aggravations; the wet and the dry remedies, the hot and the cold remedies. We have to study the remedy by circumstances.
The Dulcamara patient often becomes a sickly patient, with threatening of the catarrhal discharges to centre in the bronchial tubes, i.e., in the mucous membrane of the breathing apparatus. Many adults die of acute phthisis that might have been cured by Dulcamara, and you will find very commonly among this class of patients those that are worse from every cold, damp spell of weather. Such enter right into the Dulcamara sphere. They are better by going South where there is a continuously warm climate. The Dulcamara patient is a sickly patient, threatened with acute phthisis; pallid face, sickly yellow and sallow. This shows that it goes deeply into the life, creating such disorders as are found in very sick patients, i. c., those chronically sick, in persons whose vital economy is so much disordered that it cannot keep the body in repair.
Throat: The throat comes in for its share of trouble. Persons who in every cold damp spell have a sore throat, from getting overheated, throwing off the wraps, getting into a cold place. The Dulcamara patient says:
"Well now, I know I am fixed; I am now chilled; I begin to feel hoarseness in my throat."
On comes the sore throat; it fills with mucus, with yellow slime; the tonsils become inflamed; even quinsy comes on.
Or it may affect the throat uniformly; it may become red and inflamed and dry at times, and at other times filled with mucus, and at night the throat fills with thick, yellow, tough mucus, which is hawked up in great quantities. These colds that settle first in the nose and throat, post-nasal catarrh, of the very worst sort, gradually creep on until the whole respiratory apparatus is in a state of catarrhal Inflammation.
Every cold that be taker aggravates his catarrh wherever that may be. If it be in the nose, then the nose is aggravated; if in the chest, then those parts are aggravated. A continual rousing up. Every experienced physician must have met with many cases where for a time he felt unable to cope with the case because of his inability to reach the constitutional state that underlies this continual taking cold.
So he puzzles, for a long time, and prescribes on the immediate attack and palliates it. For instance, the immediate attack might look like Belladonna or Bryonia, Ferrum phos. or Arsenicum, etc.: he treats that attack without taking into consideration the underlying constitutional state of the patient It is quite a profitable business for one who has not much conscience and not much intelligence.
But a conscientious physician feels worried and knows he is not doing what he ought to do by his patient, unless he reaches out for the remedy which touches the constitution. It is far more useful to keep people from taking colds than to cure colds.
Bright's disease: There is a form of acute Bright's disease that Dulcamara cures. You can probably now surmise from what we have said of the nature of the remedy, that in cases of Bright's disease following scarlet fever, or from malaria, or in any acute disease that has ended badly, i. c., the patient has been exposed to the cold too soon, and has taken "cold," or from sudden change of weather, damp and cold, the feet commence to swell, there is albumin in the urine, the limbs are waxy, the face becomes waxy and sallow, and there is constant urging to urinate. Dulcamara, with other constitutional symptoms, will be suitable.
In bladder catarrh, where there is a copious discharge of mucus, or muco-pus in the urine; when the urine stands, a thick, purulent sediment, yellowish-white, and a constant urging to urinate; every time he takes a little cold, the urine becomes bloody, the frequency of urination is increased, the urine becomes irritating, the catarrh of the bladder rouses up like a flame, all the symptoms are worse in cold, damp weather, and from getting chilled; better from becoming warm. So you see whether it is a catarrh of the kidney ora catarrhal state of the bladder, or an attack of dysentery, or an attack of sudden diarrhea, every cold spell of the weather brings on an increase of the trouble.
There is another Dulcamara symptom which will often be expressed suddenly in the midst of a lot of other symptoms. After you have been hunting for a long time, the patient will say:
"Doctor, if I get chilled, I must hurry to urinate; if I get into a cold place, I have to go to stool, or to urinate."
So we see that the symptoms come on when the patient is cold, and are better when he is warm. Any catarrhal trouble of the bladder that is better in the summer and worse in the winter.
In dry, teasing coughs that are winter "colds," that go away in the summer and return in the winter. Psorinum has a dry, teasing, winter cough. Arsenicum has a winter cough.
"Rash comes out upon the face before the menses." " . . : . . . " As a forerunner of catamenia, with extraordinary sexual excitement, herpetic eruptions.
Its "cold" sores are very troublesome.
The patients are subject to these "cold" sores upon the lips and upon the genitals. Every time he takes "cold," herpes labialis, herpes preputialis.
"Catarrhal ailments in cold, damp weather."
"Mammae engorged, hard, sore and painful."
"Mammary glands swollen, inactive, painless, itching, in consequence of a 'cold' which seems to have settled in them."
"Cough, from damp, cold, atmosphere, or from getting wet."
"Cough, dry, hoarse and rough, or loose, with copious expectoration of mucus and dull hearing; catarrhal ~fever."
The cough is worse lying and in a warm room and better in the open air.
Rheumatic lameness and stiffness in the back from taking cold better by motion. Drawing pain in the lumber region extending to the lower limbs during rest. Stiff neck from every exposure to cold.
Stitching, tearing, rheumatic pains in limbs after exposure to cold, better by motion, worse at night or in the evening, with some fever. Sore, bruised feeling all over the body.
Warts on hands, fingers and face.
Eupatorium Perfoliatum (Boneset)
History: Every time I take up one of these old domestic remedies I am astonished at the extended discoveries of medical properties in the household as seen in their domestic use.
All through the Eastern States, in the rural districts, among the first old -settlers, Boneset-tea was a medicine for colds. For every cold in the head, or running of the nose, every bone-ache or high fever, or headache from cold, the good old housewife had her Boneset-tea ready. Sure enough it did such things, and the provings sustain its use. The proving shows that Boneset produces upon healthy people symptoms like the colds the old farmers used to suffer from.
Winter colds: The common winter colds through the Eastern States and the North are attended with much sneezing and coryza, pain in the head, as if it would burst, which is aggravated from motion, chilliness with the desire to be warmly covered; the bones ache as if they would break; there is fever, thirst, and a general aggravation from motion. Such common everyday colds correspond sometimes to Eupatorium and sometimes to Bryonia. These two remedies are very similar, but the aching in the bones is marked in Eupatorium.
If this state goes on for a few days the patient will become yellow, the cold will settle in the chest, a pneumonia may develop, or an inflammation of the liver, or an attack commonly called a bilious fever. Such fevers frequently call for Bryonia and Eupatorium, each fitting its own cases.
These remedies are especially useful throughout New England, New York, Ohio, the North and Canada. They do not have this kind of a cold very frequently in the warmer climates, but Eupatorium is often indicated in the warmer climates for fevers, yellow fever, bilious fever, break-bone fever and intermittent fever. It seems to be useful in one kind of complaints in one climate and in another kind of complaints in another climate.
In the Southwest and the West, in the valleys of the great river Eupatorium. cures complaints beginning as if the back would break, great shivering from head to foot spreading from the back, great sensitiveness to cold, congestive headaches, flushed face, yellow ski and yellow eyes, pain in the abdomen, and in the region of the live inability to retain any food, nausea from the sight and smell of food the bones ache as if they would break, the fever runs high, the un is of a mahogany color, the tongue is heavily coated yellow, and the is nausea and vomiting of bile.
That gives the picture of Eupatorium in the Mississippi Valley, in the Ohio Valley, in Florida and Alabama
and all through the Southern States. The most prominent symptom are the vomiting of bile, the aching of
the bones as if they would break, the pains in the stomach after eating, and the nausea from th thought and smell of food.
The stomach is very irritable; the thought of food gags him. The patient desires to keep still, but the pain is s severe that he must move and so he appears restless. These are among the acute manifestations, and are things only very general th we must take up and apply to sick people.
Eupatorium has been a very useful remedy in intermittent fever when epidemic in the valleys. Among the first signs is nausea sometime before the attack, and there are sometimes spells of vomiting bile. About seven or nine o'clock in the forenoon, he commences to shudder, the shivering runs down the back and spreads from the back to the extremities; he has violent thirst, but the shiverings are mad worse from
drinking so that he dare not drink cold water. There is soreness and pulsation in the back of the head, violent pain in th occiput and back before and during the chill. During the chill he wants to cover up and the clothing needs to be piled on.
The thirst extends through all the stages. At the close of the chill there is vomiting; often it does not occur until the heat, but before the sweat fairly sets in, he vomits copiously, first the contents of the stomach and then bile. When the heat is on he seems to burn all over, sometime as though with electric sparks.
Intense heat, burning in the top the head, his feet burn and his skin burns. The burning is more intense than the heat would justify. It is characteristic of this remedy, for the sweat to be scanty; a violent chill, intense fever which passes off slowly, and very scanty sweat. The bones ache as if they would break.
During the chill his head aches as if it would burst, it throbs it tears, it stings, it burns; he describes the headache in terms expressive of violence, as if probably a congestive headache. One would think after the fever subsides and he commences to sweat a little that he would get relief, which is true excepting the headache, which often gets worse clear through to the end of the attack, and. sometimes it will last all day and night; then he will have a whole day free from the headache, but on the third day at seven or nine o'clock on will come the same trouble with increasing violence.
At times these attacks are prolonged, the one will extend into the other, that is enter into a sort of remittent character with no intermission. The longer this runs the more the liver becomes engorged, and finally the urine is loaded with bile, the stool becomes whitish, the fever increases, the nausea increasing, the tongue becomes pointed and elongated, and is dry, the headache is extremely painful, and a state of masked fever comes on.
In those intermittent fevers that begin with violent shaking, and the headache continues without sweat, or, if with sweat the headache is made worse, thirst during all stages, vomiting of bile at the close of the heat or during the heat, with the awful bone aches, the Western men, who study their Materia Medica, know that they have a sure cure in Eupatorium.
The time for the administration of this dose is at the close of the paroxysm. You get the best effect when reaction is at the best, and that is when reaction is setting in, after a paroxysm has passed off. That is true of every paroxysmal disease, where it is possible to wait until the end. You cannot mitigate them very much during the attack, indeed, if the medicine is given then it very often increases the difficulty, but if you wait until the close of the paroxysm you get the full benefit of your medicine, and the next paroxysm will not develop, or will be lighter, or, if another attack is brought on immediately you may rest assured there will be no more.
It is not an uncommon thing in intermittent fever, when the remedy has been administered at the close of the paroxysm, for the next paroxysm to come within twenty-four hours after the administration of the medicine; these mixed cases are often in a state of disorder.
One who does not know this would immediately show the white feather, would be alarmed, would be afraid the patient was getting worse, but you have only to wait for the subsidence of the attack and you will see that you have broken its cycle and periodicity.
When this remedy has been apparently indicated by intermittents, and it has not proved of sufficient depth to root out the intermittent, there are two remedies, either of which is likely to follow it, and these are Natrum muriaticum and Sepia. These two remedies are very closely related to Eupatorium, and take up the work where it leaves off, when the symptoms agree.
Gout: This medicine has also a chronic constitutional state, viz.: its gouty nature. It is a very useful medicine in gout. It has gouty soreness and inflamed nodosities of the finger joints, of the elbow joint, pain and gouty swelling of the great toe, red tumefaction of the joint of the great toe. It establishes, in persons who are subject to chalk stone deposits around the finger joints. These gouty subjects take cold, the bones ache, the joints become inflamed, the patient will say he is chilly, the skin becomes yellow, the urine is charged with bile, the stool becomes whitish, and he becomes weak.
In many instances these patients have been for years resorting to Burgundy for relief of their gouty joints and the weakness. Some one of our homoeopathic remedies will relieve the suffering, but in those old gouty subjects who have been always drinking wine, you cannot take the wine away from them at once; you cannot do it while they are having the attack, because they have become so accustomed to it.
Burgundy is the kind of wine very commonly used by the gouty, but the Scotchman with his gout thinks he must always have a little Scotch whiskey and in the attack it is quite impossible to take it away from him. What has been his custom must be followed out for a while because he would grow weaker, but it is damaging him, and hence it is difficult to contend with gouty subjects who have been taking stimulants. You do not get the full benefit of Homoeopathy and you cannot stop his stimulants because weakness will follow. Persons who have not taken wine as a regular beverage can and should do without it, as it interferes with the action of the homoeopathic remedy.
These gouty patients have terrible sick headaches. Pain in the base of the brain and back of the head, associated with gouty joints. These are often referred to as arthritic headaches, that is, gouty headaches, headaches associated with painful joints. Or the headaches may alternate with pains in the joints. Congestive headaches, the pain being in the base of the brain, with more or less throbbing; the pain spreads up through the head and produces a general congestive attack.
Sometimes these headaches come on when the joints are feeling better, and the more headache he has the less pain he has in the extremities; and again, when the gout affects the extremities, then the headaches diminish. Headaches, having a third and seventh-day aggravation, coming with more or less periodicity.
With the headache there will be nausea and vomiting of bile, nausea at the thought and smell of food. This gouty individual is also subject to vertigo, and the sensation as if he would fall to the left is especially noted with the coming on of the headache. The vertigo comes on in the morning; when he gets up he feels as if he would sway to the left, and he has to guard himself in turning to the left. Sometimes in intermittent fever this symptom of swaying to the left and vertigo ending in nausea and vomiting, violent pain in the back of the head and pain in the bones, are the first threatenings.
We have in this remedy also other gouty manifestations: shooting through the temples, shooting from the left to the right side of the head; shooting all through the head; stitching, tearing pains in the limbs as well as the bone aches.
The headaches are so violent that they make him sick at the stomach. In gouty headaches, in intermittents at the close of the intense heat, in periodical headaches, the course is the same, the pain is so intense that nausea is soon brought on and then he vomits bile. Eupatorium has not been used on its symptoms in gouty states as often as it might have been. In intermittent fever it is well known; in headaches it is only occasionally used.
Only occasionally does a man realize its great benefit in headaches and in remittent fevers. In gouty and rheumatic affections it may be suited to the symptoms and is more useful than is generally known. It is not the purpose of our talks to point out ultimates of disease. I do not look upon gout as a disease, but as a great class of symptoms of a rheumatic character that occur in the human family; a great mass of symptoms
that may be called gouty, a tendency to enlargement of the joints and gouty deposits in the urine. The ordinary so-called lithaemia is a gouty constitution.
The gouty state of the economy is the superficial or apparent cause; the real cause rests in the miasm. So when I speak of gout I do not mean the name of a disease, but a class of manifestations that are met in large cities especially, less frequently in the country where the people live on farms and take plenty of exercise and have wholesome food and are not housed up. It is supposed to be due to wine drinking. Often when I say to patients that the symptoms arc somewhat gouty, they reply,
"I am not in the habit of drinking wine. I have not been a high liver." Such conditions of course bring on a tendency to gout.
Painful soreness in the eyeballs like Bryonia and Gelsemium. The eyeballs are very sensitive to touch and sore to pressure; feel as if he had been struck a blow in the eye; sore, bruised, pain in the eye. Coryza with aching in every bone.
Stools: With the bilious attacks there often may be an ending in a diarrhoea; copious green discharges, green fluid or semi solid stools, but after the attack has lingered until there is one grand emptying out of the bowels, this symptom will disappear and the secondary state comes on in which there is constipation and a light-colored stool, or bileless stool.
Cough: Boneset has a dry, hacking, teasing cough, that seems to rack the whole frame, as if it would break him up, it is so sore, and he is so much disturbed by motion. A great amount of tribulation is found in the respiratory tract, in the bronchial tubes.
We find a cough in capillary bronchitis that shakes the whole frame, analogous to Bryonia and Phosphorus. The subject is extremely sensitive to the cold air, as much so as in Nux vomica. Nux vomica has aching in the bones as if they would break; he wants the room hot, and wants to be covered with clothing which relieves; often the slightest lifting of the covers increases the chilliness, which is true also of Eupatorium, so they run close together.
Mind: In Nux vomica we have the dreadful irritability of temper; in Eupatorium we have overwhelming sadness. The Nux vomica patient is not likely to say much about dying, he is too irritable to go into the next world; not so with Eupatorium, he is full of sadness.
There are other states that comes on secondarily in this medicine. After malarial attacks and in gouty affections, etc., there is bloating of the lower limbs, oedematous swelling. It is not an uncommon thing for a malarial fever that has lingered a long time to be attended with swelling of the lower limbs. Eupatorium very strongly competes with Natrum muriaticum, China, and Arsenicum in such lingering malaria.
Dropsy: When the symptoms have largely subsided and left only this state of anaemia and dropsy of the lower extremities, in the badly treated case, it is very difficult to find what medicine to administer, and the course that the homoeopath must pursue is to go back and examine the patient to find the symptoms he had at the time of the intermittent fever, before he was meddled with. If now there is swelling of the extremities, and you get symptoms to show you that he needed Eupatorium in the beginning, Eupatorium will still cure the dropsy of the extremities.
It may bring back the chill, it may bring back an orderly state that you can prescribe on. If in the beginning he needed Arsenicum, that remedy will bring back the chill, turn it right end to and cure his symptoms. The trouble is that the symptoms were only suppressed, bad not been cured.
So the medicine he needed, but has never had for the chill, may be the medicine that he needs now. Then think of Eupatorium in dropsical swellings of the feet and ankles, and in gouty swellings also. The gouty swellings are all of an inflammatory character.
Very commonly these are closely related to hydrarthrosis, and here Eupatorium. is to be compared with Arsenicum. Gouty inflammation of the knee. All the way through this remedy you read about bone-aches and bone pains.
It is peculiar that medicines come around on time with an exactitude. Diseases do the same thing, and we must see that it is also peculiar that they come with a regular cycle, a regular periodicity. We meet with headaches that come every seven days, headaches also, that come once in two weeks, and there are remedies that have seven-day aggravations and fourteen-day aggravations and three-day aggravations, remedies that bring out their symptoms just in this form.
Do not be surprised when your patient is perfectly under the influence of Aurum if he has a characteristic aggravation every twenty-one days.
There are quite a number of remedies having fourteen-day aggravations, e. g., China and Arsenicum. Again, there are autumnal aggravations, spring aggravations, winter aggravations, aggravations from cold weather and aggravations in the summer from heat.
Some remedies have both the latter.
Euphrasia
Head: Euphrasia is a short acting remedy of great usefulness in acute catarrhal affections with or without fever. Headaches that occur with coryza and eye symptoms, head aches in the evening as if bruised. Stitching pain in the head.
Headaches; as if the head would burst with dazzling of the eyes from sunlight. These are catarrhal headaches with profuse watery discharge from the eyes and nose. The eye symptoms of Euphrasia are its most prominent feature.
Catarrh condition of the eyes with copious, acrid, watery discharge with or without coryza. Cutting pain in the eyes extending into the head, pressure in the eyes as if caused by sand. Sensation of dryness, burning, biting in the eyes. Sensation of dust in the eyes. Violent itching of the eyes obliging rubbing and winking, with copious lachrymation. Pupils much contracted and much tumefaction of the mucous membrane with redness and enlarged blood vessels and smarting.
Iritis: from rheumatism or in connection with rheumatic joints. Copious thin or thick discharges. General inflammation of all the tissues of the eyes. Ulceration of the cornea. It has cured Pannus. Pustular inflammation. Opacity of the cornea after injuries of the eye. It is suitable in the most violent acute conjunctivitis. Amblyopia with inflammation of conjunctiva and lids.
Copious lachrymation and burning. The mucous membranes of the lids and eyeballs are injected, red, and vascular. agglutination of the lids in the morning. Copious, acrid lachrymation with fluent discharge from the nose during coryza. Dryness of the lids and the margins of the lids red swollen, and burning. The lids are very sensitive and swollen. The margins of the lids itch and burn.
Suppuration of the margins of the lids. Much swelling of the lids with inflammation. Fine rash about the eyes with puffiness of the lids. Blurred vision. Paralysis of the third nerve.
The next most important group of symptoms is in connection with the nose. Sneezing and fluent coryza. The discharge is bland and this occurs with acrid lachrymation. The nasal mucous membrane is swollen.
Profuse, bland, fluent, coryza. After this coryza has existed for a day or two it extends into the larynx with a hard cough. The coryza is worse during the night while lying down. The cough is worse in the daytime and ameliorated by lying down.
The remedy has a rash like measles and it has febrile symptoms; therefore, when these symptoms are duly considered, it will be seen that Euphrasia is similar to the symptoms that occur in measles. It is a wonderful medicine in measles though not so frequently indicated as Pulsatilla, owing to the fact that this combination of symptoms does not often come.
Larynx and cough: Hoarseness in the morning. Irritation in the larynx compelling him to cough, followed by pressure beneath the sternum. Abundant secretion in the larynx causing loose cough with rattling in the chest.
Deep inspiration is difficult. The cough, considered by itself, furnishes a very rare group of symptoms. Cough with copious expectoration along with or following coryza. Difficult respiration ameliorated at night while lying down.
Worse in the morning when moving about with copious expectoration. Violent cough from tickling in the larynx. No cough at night causes the remedy to resemble Bry. and Mang. The dyspnoea and cough are ameliorated by lying down. The coryza symptoms, otherwise, are worse at night and from lying down. When these symptoms occur in grippe or influenza, this becomes a very suitable remedy.
The abundance of mucus scraped from the larynx and trachea is often like the ending of bad colds. The expectoration is easy and almost without cough. It comes up without much effort. Pressive pain beneath the sternum showing that the trachea is especially involved in the catarrhal condition. The pain in the eyes is worse in the open air. The coryza is worse in the open air. The cough sometimes comes on in the open air.
Windy weather causes fluent coryza. Cold air and windy weather cause lachrymation. He is a chilly patient and cannot get warm in bed.
There is chill, fever, and sweat in this remedy. This chill predominates. The fever occurs mostly during the day with red face and cold hands. The heat descends the body. The perspiration is often confined to the front part of the body. Perspiration during sleep at night. Strange odor sometimes very offensive and most profuse upon the chest. It is especially suitable in catarrhal fever, influenza and measles.
When the symptoms agree, it will make a violent attack of measles turn into a very simple form, making the patient feel better, bring out the eruption, control the fever, and relieve the cough, coryza, and other catarrhal symptoms. Streaming, hot, burning tears with rash, photophobia, running from the nose, intense throbbing headaches, redness of the eyes, photophobia from fever, dry cough during measles.
Ferrum Metallicum
Iron: We will take up the study of Ferrum metallicum. The Old School has been giving Iron for anaemia throughout all tradition. They have given it in great quantities in the form of the tincture of chloride, and the carbonate.
Whenever the patient became anemic, pallid, waxy and weak, Iron was the tonic. It is true that Iron produces anemia, and it would be astonishing to any one who ever read the provings of Ferrum of the allopaths did not create additional bloodlessness with the doses of Iron they administer.
It is true that under the provings, and under those circumstances where Iron has been given in excess, the patient becomes greenish, waxy, yellow and pallid, with a sickly and anemic countenance. The lips become pale; the ears lose their pink color; the skin of the body becomes waxy, and there comes a tendency to hemorrhage, at times with clots, but commonly with copious, thin, liquid blood, very dark.
The clots will separate and the fluid parts look brown, dirty and watery. The patient gradually emaciates. He is pallid and waxy; his muscles become flabby and relaxed; he is incapable of endurance. All the muscular fibers become tired from any exertion. Rapid exercise, or, any unusual exertion. is impossible. Any rapid exertion or motion brings on weakness, dyspnea, sinking and fainting.
A strange thing running through all the constitutional conditions of Ferrum is that the pains and sufferings come on during rest.
The palpitation sometimes comes on during rest, the dyspnoea comes on during rest, and even the weakness. The patient is ameliorated by moving gently about, but any exertion tires and causes faintness.
Any rapid motion aggravates the complaints. The pains are ameliorated by moving about the house slowly, so that the exertion does not excite or fatigue. In many cases the patient is dropsical. The skin pits upon pressure and is pale, yet the face shows an appearance of plethora. From every little excitement the face becomes flushed.
During the chill the face becomes red. From taking wine or stimulant the face becomes flushed, and the patient, though flabby, relaxed and tired, does not get credit for being sick.
She fails to get the sympathy of her friends. She is feeble, she suffers from palpitation and dyspnoea, she has great weakness with inability to do anything like work, she feels that she must lie down-yet the face is flushed. This is called a pseudo-plethora.
The blood-vessels are distended, the veins varicose, and their coatings relaxed. On this account bleed ing takes place easily; capillary oozing; hemorrhage from all pass of the body, haemorrhage from the nose, the lungs, the uterus.
Women suffer much from haemorrhage from the uterus, especially during and after the climacteric period. Ferrum will be found of great value when the symptoms agree in that wonderful anemic state called "green sickness," that comes on with girls at the time of puberty and in the years that follow it.
There will be almost no menstrual flow, but a cough will develop, with great pallor. So common is this sickness among girls that all mothers are acquainted with and dread it. In a large practice you will have a number of cases of chlorosis.
Sometimes the early menstrual period is attended with a copious, and then occurs, and this goes on for a number of years before anything like menstrual regularity is established.
In these cases the Old School always used to feed their patients Iron in great quantities, but the more Iron the patient took the worse she grew.
Congestion, tending upwards, with red face, hot head and coldness of the extremities. But the heat of the head and face is not at all in proportion to the red appearance. It will be found that this congestion upward in Ferrum will take place during a chill, in septic fevers or in other forms of fever, and the head is not always hot, but sometimes cool. The face may be red and cool.
Face: Another grand feature of Ferrum is that, like China, it has complaints from loss of animal fluids; from prolonged haemorrhage, with weakness remaining a long time. There is no repair, no assimilation. The bones are soft and easily bent; they take on crooks. Emaciated and feeble children. Dryness of the joints, causing cracking on motion. Sudden emaciation, with false plethora.
Redness of face - a healthy looking bloom - in one who is unable to walk fast on the street, or to stand any exertion. Yet some of the complaints of Ferrum are better from occupation, from doing something, from taking a little exercise, because the complaints come on during rest.
Over-excitability and sensivity of the nerves; oversensitiveness to pain. The sensitive woman who needs Ferrum has a flushed face and is often complaining because she gets no sympathy. She does not look sick, yet she puffs on going up stairs; she feels weak and wants to lie down.
Restless when keeping still; must keep the limbs moving. Rending pains in the limbs; dull aching in the limbs. These pass off when moving about quietly and gently, like Pulsatilla. But Ferrum is a very cold remedy, and is ameliorated by warmth, except the pains about the neck, face and teeth, which are ameliorated by cold. But most of the pains are ameliorated by heat; the patient wants to keep warm and dreads anything like fresh air or a draught.
Weakness and prostration; weakness even from talking. Prostration with irregular pulse and rapid pulse, or with too slow pulse; palpitation. And then comes paralytic weakness; the limbs give out. Paralytic conditions from anaemia or haemorrhage. Fainting spells from haemorrhage. Jerking and twitching of the muscles; chorea; catalepsy.
Mind: You may easily imagine something of the character of the mental symptoms, for they are like the physical. The mind is confused and the patient tearful. Depression of spirits; mental weariness and depression. The highest degree of depression and despondency. Anxiety from the slightest cause; irritability.
The least noise, like the crackling of paper, sets the patient wild. It brings on nervous excitement and restlessness; she must get up and move.
Excitement from the slightest opposition. Any sudden or rapid motion, or the least hurry, causes blackness before the eyes; dizziness; things turn in a circle; she must sit down. And with all this the face is red. When alone and at rest, the face becomes pale and cold, but the least excitement brings a flush to the cheeks.
Headaches: The headaches are congestive in character, with mounting of blood upwards. There is a sense of fullness and distension, with red face.
Fullness and distension of the eyes; fullness of the neck. Palpitation of the heart. Exophthalmic goitre. The headaches are ameliorated by pressure. Ferrum wants to be pressed to support the veins. Throbbing like hammers in the head.
Every quick motion aggravates the headache. Coughing aggravates the headache; pain in the head and occiput from coughing. These pains are sometimes ameliorated by walking gently. Going up stairs, sitting down, rising from a seat unless it is done very deliberately - will arouse all the pains of Ferrum.
Any sudden motion will bring on hammering and a feeling of great expansion in the head. And then will come more or less shooting, tearing pains. Beating in the back of the head from rising or from coughing, because coughing is a sudden motion. Confusion of mind with hammering headache. Rush of blood to the head. Congestive headaches from excitement; from taking cold; from exposure; lasting three or four days or a week. The face is gushed and perhaps cold, the head somewhat hot, but not as hot as would be expected.
Redness of the eye; engorged vessels. Great weakness, dyspnoea and palpitation. Writing - a mental operation - causes the headache to reappear. Great sensitiveness of the scalp. The patient must let the hair hang down. Mental disorders and headaches accompanying or following haemorrhages, and in lying in women.
Bloated appearance about the eyes. All sorts of disturbance of vision from congestion. Venous stasis; swelling of the eyelids; pus-like discharge. Over-sensitiveness to sound; ringing in the ears.
The symptoms of the nose are numerous. Colds and catarrhal troubles, ending in nosebleed. Nosebleed on slight provocation, with headaches at the menstrual nisus.
Scabs form in the nose. Extreme paleness of the face; face becomes red and flushed on the least emotion. Flushed face with dropsy of the lower limbs; flushed face with chill. Thirst during the chill is a striking feature of Ferrum. During the menstrual period there are violent pains, and as soon as the pain starts the face becomes flushed.
Nothing taken into the stomach digests, and yet there is no special nausea. It is the exception to find nausea in Ferrum. Food goes into the stomach and is vomited without nausea-simply emptied out. Sometimes there are eructations of food by the mouthful, like Phosphorus.
Food: Phosphorus was the remedy with all the old masters for spitting up of food by the mouthful until. the stomach was empty.
Canine hunger. It says in the next: "Double the amount of an ordinary meal in the evening was hardly sufficient."
All food tastes bitter; solid food is dry and insipid. After eating there are eructations. Heat in the stomach; regurgitation of food. Spasmodic pressure in the stomach after the least food or drink, especially after meat. Aversion to meat, to eggs, to sour fruit. Aversion to milk, and to his accustomed tobacco and beer. Sweet wines agree, but sour wines and all sour things disagree. The tongue feels as if burnt. As soon as the stomach is empty vomiting ceases until he eats again. Vomiting of food, immediately after midnight, Vomitus tastes sour.
Pregnancy: Ferrum is occasionally indicated during pregnancy. A few weeks after becoming pregnant the woman commences to throw up her food by the mouthful.
There is no nausea, but the face is flushed and the woman is flabby and weak. She vomits without becoming sick. Fullness and pressure in the stomach; pressure in the stomach after eating. Ferrum is an unusually interesting remedy because of this peculiar stomach. It is like a leather bag; it will not digest anything. Fill it up and it empties itself just as easily as it was filled.
Ferrum has a troublesome diarrhoea, with acrid watery excoriating stool. Morning diarrhoea. Many of these patients are old sinners with broken-down constitutions, who have suffered long from constipation. Chronic constipation with ineffectual urging and hard, difficult Stools.
Relaxation runs through the remedy. From this relaxation there is prolapsus of the rectum, vagina and uterus. Dragging down in the lower part of the body, as if the organs would come out-and sometimes they do come out.
Bladder: The bladder is also relaxed. Its sphincter is weak, and there is no regularity of its muscular action. Hence, we have involuntary urination from sudden motion, from walking, or from coughing. In little children the urine dribbles all day just as long as the child plays the urine dribbles and keeps the clothing wet, but this better while keeping perfectly quiet.
The bladder is so relaxed and tired that it cannot hold the urine, and as soon as it is partially filled it allows its contents to escape. This relaxation runs through the remedy and gives it character, just like a human being. You know what each one of your friends is likely to do on every occasion. So it is with a remedy. You ought to know what it is most likely to do, in order to know what it will accomplish in curing the sick.
Genital: Weakness and relaxation of the genital organs is common to Ferrum. The menstrual flow comes in for its share. Copious, watery flow; haemorrhage or suppression - amenorrhoea - no flow at all, only a leucorrhoea. Suppression of the menses with great nervous excitement; with flushed face; with weakness and palpitation. Prolapsus of the vagina. Insensibility of the vagina during coition. Metrorrhagia. Menses too soon too profuse and lasting too long.
Respiration: Difficult respiration; pains and disturbances in the chest. Difficult breathing, with a sense of a great load on the chest. Suffocating fits at night; catarrhal conditions of the respiratory tract; congestion of the chest; dyspnoea.
Spasmodic cough, such as we find in whooping cough, coming on in violent paroxysms. Cough after every meal, with gagging, emptying the stomach of its contents. Cough felt in the head. Cough worse from the abuse of brandy, tobacco or tea. Cough coming on after the loss of fluids, as after haemorrhages.
Chest troubles following uterine hemorrhage, and after other hemorrhages. Coughing up blood; bleeding from the lungs. Persons debilitated by secret vices, with a tendency to go into tuberculosis.
Palpitation of the heart from fear, excitement, or exertion. Rapid action of the heart, or sometimes slow action. Fatty degeneration of the heart. Pulse accelerated toward evening. Pulsations throughout the body, feeling like little hammers.
Rheumatic pains: in the extremities, ameliorated by heat and by gentle motion; aggravated by cold, by exertion, or by rapid motion. Pains through the deltoid muscles are spoken of more prominently than pains in other parts, but these pains are no more striking than the pains anywhere in Ferrum.
Tearing pains through the limbs. Inability to raise the arm; paralytic pains, - that is, pains that are benumbing. Pains that make him feel as if he were going to lose the power to move the part. Violent pains in the hip-joint are just as common as the pains in the shoulder.
Lippe says,
"Rheumatism in the left shoulder," but it is just as common in the right. Rheumatic pains in the deltoid muscle of either side. Violent pain in the muscles and along the nerves. Pinching in the right deltoid; boring in the right shoulder; aggravated by motion and by the weight of the bedclothes; ameliorated by heat.
Tearing and stinging pains. The Ferrum pains come on in the night, because the patient attempts to keep still in bed. Rest brings on the Ferrum pains. When moving gently about in the daytime be will not have so much pain. Coldness of the limbs; and again, heat of the soles and palms, they change about. With all this weakness and prostration dropsical conditions come on, so that the feet and hands become bloated.
Evening chill or chilliness with fever, cold hands and feet and red face. Icy cold feet with the chill. Chill ameliorated after eating. Thirst with the chill. Copious sweat which stains yellow. All symptoms worse while sweating. Strong-smelling night sweats. All the febrile symptoms are better by slowly moving about. In intermittent fever after the abuse of quinine.
We read in the text that Ferrum is a remedy for diarrhea in the last stages of consumption. Well, sometimes it is, if the patient is prepared to die.
Ferrum will stop the diarrhea, but after it is stopped the patient will not live long. The diarrhea is not usually painful. It is annoying, but it is painless, and the night sweats are painless. Do not suppress them; they had better be let alone. Let the patient go on to a peaceful termination.
The best remedy for diarrhoea in the last stages of consumption is Saccharum lactis in the crude form, given in very small quantities and repeated as often as is required by the patient and the bystanders.
Ferrum Phosphoricum
Great weakness, and desire to lie down. Nervous at night. Rheumatic conditions.
While it has been used by Schuessler's followers for the first stage of inflammatory fevers, it is useful in the higher potencies in chronic diseases, and is a deep acting anti-psoric, It could not be less than the Ferrum and Phosphoric acid that form it.
For many years I followed the Schiiessler indications, but by the aid of new provings, homeopathic aggravations, and clinical experience the present arrangement of symptoms furnishes my guide for this valuable homoeopathic remedy.
The time of aggravation: of some complaints is in the morning, some in afternoon; others come in the evening and night, and after midnight. The patient is sensitive to the open air, and many symptoms are aggravated in open air.
The most noticeable features are anaemia and chlorosis (like Ferr'um). The general physical anxiety is more like Phos. acid. Lack of vital heat, and aggravation in cold air and from becoming cold. Always taking cold. Congestion of head and organs, with fever and red face.
The general weakness is like the low vitality of the phtisical inheritance. Dropsical conditions. Symptoms worse after eating, from physical exertion. Fainting spells. Cold drinks bring on symptoms. Sour food aggravates. Vascular fullness and distension of veins.
The haemorrhagic condition is a strong feature, as it is in Ferrum, Phos. acid and Phos. The nervousness of hysteria and hypochondriasis is found in this remedy. Soreness through the body, especially in congested parts; with aggravation from jar and walking. Complaints from lifting and straining muscles, and from sprains.
Many symptoms are worse lying in bed and from rest, and ameliorated by moving slowly about (like Ferrum), but the great lassitude compels him to lie down. Motion that is a real exertion aggravates, but slow. motion ameliorates. Numbness of parts and suffering parts. Surging of blood in body and head.
Stitching, tearing pains. Tearing downwards. False plethora. Strong pulsation over body, and in head. Strong, full, frequent pulse. Generally oversensitive, and sensitive to pain. Standing aggravates many complaints. Trembling limbs. All combine to give us a remedy broad and deep acting.

Fluoricum Acidum
It takes a long time for this remedy, in the proving, to develop its symptoms. It is a very deep-acting medicine, and an antipsoric, antisyphilitic and anti-sycotic.
It is insidious in its action and its symptoms are slow in approach; it is like the deepest and slowest and most tedious diseases, the miasms, and hence it is suitable in the very slowest and lowest forms of disease.
While it has in its nature some febrile action, it is not for this purpose that it is oftenest called for its most typical febrile action is very slow and insidious. It corresponds to overheated states of the system, old cases of nightly fevers, coming on week after week and year after year.
It is an unusually hot-blooded remedy at times, and again it has conditions of coldness. In the evening and night great heat seems to evolve from the body without increase of temperature. The skin becomes very hot.
That patient is often < from warm things, < from covering, < from warm air; suffocates somewhat like Puls. in a warm room. He wants to bathe the face and head in cold water; such bathing is grateful.
The feet burn and are put out of bed in the night; he hunts around in bed for a cool place for the feet and bands. The soles perspire, and the palms perspire, and the sweat is acrid, making the parts sore; excoriation from the sweat between the toes.
The perspiration is offensive; offensive, acrid sweat between the toes. Burning, unusual heat and acridity are words that modify a great many symptom s; an acrid lachrymation or other discharge from the eye; acrid discharge from the nose, acrid sweat, etc.
Sensation of burning and burning pains in parts; heat evolved from the body as a chronic state. Aggravation from heat, from outward heat and from inward heat, belongs to this remedy. It is a strong feature, of this remedy to be worse from drinking tea and coffee. Warm, drinks bring on a diarrhea, or flatulence, or disturbance in the stomach, and cause indigestion to manifest itself in various way The symptoms are worse standing and sitting and better in the open air.
It is a remedy of great depth of action. It so disturbs the functions that there are peculiar outward signs in the nails, in the hair, in the skin; they are all imperfectly developed.
Skin: Whenever such is the case, we know that a remedy has great depth of action and that it is very long acting. It forms like incrustations here and there upon the skin that seem to have no tendency to heal.
A crust forms, but there seems to be no healing beneath the crust. The hair loses its luster; it falls out, and if examined closely under the microscope it is seen to be necrosed; little ragged ulcers will be found along the course of the hair.
The ends of the hair are dry, the hair mats and splits and breaks, becomes ragged in masses and lustreless. The nails are crippled, likewise corrugations in the nails; the nails grow too fast and grow awkwardly; that is, they are deformed and crippled, too thick in some places, and too thin in others; break easily, brittle.
There is a tendency to breaking down of a slow character, where the circulation is very feeble and the skin is near bone or cartilage as in the cartilages in the ears, and in the cartilages of joints.
Ulcers develop over the tibia. There is feeble circulation in the hands and feet and they become cold. In the evening the extremities burn and are feverish, because that is the time of the feverish state; but in the morning and in the daytime there is coldness of the extremities.
The patient is pallid and sickly, and at times becomes waxy and dropsical; oedema of the extremities, and particularly of the lower extremities; oedema of certain parts; oedema of the prepuce.
When a debilitated subject, one suffering from bone and cartilaginous troubles, contracts gonorrhoea, with it he will have enormous swelling of the prepuce, and nothing seems to act upon it. Fluoric acid will cure oedema of the prepuce with gonorrhoea in such a subject. Cannabis sativa has the same symptom, but it is especially useful in robust cases.
Fluoric acid will prevent the manifestation of disease in sycotic subjects, will prevent formation of fig warts. It cures fig warts. It produces hardened, dry warts, and dry crusts upon the skin, and crusts not unlike rupia. It is useful in syphilitic rupia.
Bone affections stand out prominently. Necrosis, especially of the long bones, but also of the bones of the ear. It creates an offensive acrid discharge from the ear. It establishes an offensive oezena, an acrid discharge, with necrosis of the nasal bones.
It is very analogous to Sil., and it is one of the natural followers of Sil. where Sil. has been too frequently repeated by persons who do not know that Silicea does its best in a single dose and that it is a long acting and slow medicine.
It not only antidotes the abuse of Sil., but also follows Sil., After practicing a while you will be surprised to observe the Pendulum like -action between beat and cold in various complementary remedies.
To make that clear I will illustrate it by using the series in which this remedy is set and to which it naturally belongs. You take a patient who is hot-blooded, who is always suffering from the heat, from too much clothing and too warm a room especially in the evenings, a patient that is tearful and sad, and may bea blonde.
Why you say, I am trying to describe a Pulsatilla patient. Well, yes; anyone can see that. Puls. is a hot- blooded patient, but after using that remedy a while you notice that the patient goes to the other extreme and becomes chilly, and wants much clothing; the heat is taken out of the case. Sil. is the natural follower of Puls., and you would be astonished to know bow often a patient leaving Puls. runs toward Sil.
Sil. goes deeper into the case, it does more cutting, and it is the, natural chronic of Puls. Other remedies of course follow Puls., but Sil. more frequently than any other medicine. Now, that is the second step; the patient has gone from a warm to a cool state; the overheated state has been lost and he has gone into Sil., but when Sil. has been administered for a while it cures the cold state, and removes the chilliness of the patient (remember, however, that Sil. has at times something of Puls. in it; in some of its complaints it is < from being overheated) and the patient under Sil. goes back to the warm state again, becomes hot-blooded, wants the warm covers thrown off, wants to be lightly covered.
Then it is that this medicine comes in the series. Fluor. ac. follows Sil. as naturally as Sil. follows Puls. They exist in threes.
Series: There are other remedies that exist in threes, but the most common ones you will think of will be: Sulph., Calc. and Lyc.;
Sulph., Sars. and Sep.; and
Coloc. and Caust. and Staph., which often follow each other and rotate in this way.
Do not let these facts make you give a routine remedy unless the symptoms agree, but it does help to remember that remedies are somewhat similar. It is true that Puls., Sil. and Fluor. ac. are similar all along the line as to the nature of their symptoms.
Puls. corresponds to more acute disturbances, or to the earlier stages of chronic disease, the more active or violent operations of chronic disease. It will take off the wire edge of the disease, and it will be followed by some medicine that is complementary to it, always to be determined by the symptoms that arise.
There are cases that would be greatly injured by so deeply acting a remedy as Sil. if given in the beginning, that is, the suffering would be unnecessary; but if you commence with Puls. you can mitigate the case and prepare it to receive Sil., providing the two would appear to be ona plane of agreement.
A very serious case had better first receive Puls., and the way being paved by that remedy follow it up with Sil.
Bones: Think of the remedy, then, in vicious bone diseases, in necrosis and caries, in fistulous openings, fistula leading to the teeth, fistula lachrymalis and fistula in ano; in calcareous degenerations; in deformity of the nails, hair and teeth; in affections of the thigh bones and leg bones, with chronic fistulous openings leading to bone discharging pus which excoriates the parts all around.
The patient is over-sensitive; is made worse if the bowels do not move regularly; is distressed if the menstrual flow is slightly delayed; suffers if the call to urinate cannot be immediately attended to, hence, as in the text, "headaches > by micturition."
Headache: That symptom is all that is given in the text; but remember something that is analogous to it, viz.; If the call to urinate be not attended to the headache will continue to grow < until the urine is avoided.
That is a peculiar symptom, and it sometimes leads to the study of Fluor, ac. Violent congestive headache with beat and fullness. Violent occipital headaches, worse from motion.
Now, if we take into consideration its great depth of action, we will see furthermore that it is suitable in some brain diseases. In persons who have overworked, who have been working day and night to establish a business, or to keep it up, and when there has been constant use of the brain it is suitable.
Mind: In mental depression and melancholy, with great sadness, in young men who have destroyed the nervous system by vicious practices, by secret vice. It is particularly suitable for that disorder of the human economy where men have continuously changed their mistresses.
There is a state in which a man is never satisfied with one woman, but continually changes and goes from bad to worse until he is a debauchee. Ifa young man cannot keep away from women, he is not so bad off if he will only keep to one, but he goes from one to many, until he stands upon the street corners and, in his lust, craves the innocent women that go along the street.
Fluoric acid is suitable in that state, like Picric acid and Sepia, and these medicines are particularly suited to that condition of enfeeblement of the mind and that disorder of the human economy that makes man so low, that we have the state described as "low mindedness."
It takes that form in one who is a sort of debauchee, running after alt sorts of things to tickle his fancy, but it takes another form in a man who stays at home with his good wife. He takes an aversion to his children and to his dearest friends and his wife, that is, he has lost that true and noble and orderly affection and friendship and companionship which ought to exist, and he fights against it.
An orderly man considers his wife his best friend and he would rather stay with her than go anywhere else. To him there is no place like home. Now, when man arrives at the state when he wants to go somewhere else, that he wants to go away from home, that be is disturbed at home, that everything annoys him at home, that be no longer loves his children as he once did, he needs Fluoric acid.
"Feeling of indifference towards those he loves best." The Sepia state is like this, but Sep. is more frequently indicated in women. The woman will say,
"Doctor, there is one thing that I regret very much, and that is, I do not seem to enjoy my children, my home, my companions, my husband and my friends.
There is a sort of alienation.”
Such is the way it is told where it is Sepia. In the man it is more commonly Fluoric acid, in the woman more commonly Sep., but this need not necessarily be so. Sepia corresponds more closely to the condition of the uterus and ovaries, and such conditions, as the woman alone can have. (Compare Calcarea.)
Men: Fluoric acid has with this state an overwhelming sexual erethism.
He is kept awake nights by erections. This state of desire forces itself upon him, not only when he is with the opposite sex, but at all times. At times, in the beginning of a gonorrhea, this condition of priapism and intense uncontrollable sexual desire, with swelling of the foreskin is overcome by Fluoric acid. There are times when this priapism demands Canth., but that remedy differs wholly in its nature from this.
Mind: Reticence and silence; sitting and saying nothing. This reticence is like Puls., and often belongs to the insane who will sit in the corner and say nothing all day, never uttering one single word, and hardly answering when spoken to.
A patient sits in the corner and says nothing and does nothing, eats when food is offered, is led to her room when the time comes, resists nobody, answers nothing; such a state is found in Pulsatilla, and is closely allied to this remedy.
There, is some insanity in it, but especially the fatigue and mildness of a the brain. Mental exhaustion from overwork or from vices.
It is suitable after Sil. in the spinal affections that are attended with paralysis, trembling and numbness in the soles of the feet. It will often stop the progress of structural nervous diseases and prevent the, case from getting worse.
Veins: An excellent and very useful feature of this remedy is its ability to produce varicose veins and varicose ulcers.
The veins become varicosed anywhere, but particularly upon the lower limbs, especially following pregnancy.
Hemorrhoids protrude after a stool; the anus and rectum protrude, and there is some bleeding, because of the hemorrhoidal condition. Varicose conditions with very old ulcers upon the lower extremities; the varicose veins ulcerate.
You might predict what kind of ulcer and what kind of a margin Fluoric acid would produce. We see the feebleness of its circulation, we see its tendency to create hard crusts, and hardened, horny skin and eruptions.
We might now easily assume that the inflamed borders of an ulcer would become indurated, hard and glassy. The margins of ulcers are indurated and the ulcer is an old, indolent ulcer.
Parts once broken will not close up. Union will not take place between the broken ends of bones, there is no repair. From bones and from ulcers, we have the foetid, acrid, thin, watery discharges, or at times very scanty discharges, but acrid, burning the parts all around, raising eruptions and scurfs around the ulcers.
From the feebleness of the circulation one might suppose that numbness would naturally be present, and it is true.
The ears become numb, the scalp becomes numb, there is a sensation as if the back of the head were made of wood. The scalp loses its sensation, the hair falls out and crusts form. The extremities become numb and there is numbness of the feet and bands extending upwards; numbness, with or without dropsy; numbness in spinal affections; numbness in brain diseases. Numbness of the limb not laid on.
"Crusta lactea; dry scales; itches very much, bald places.
Caries of the temporal bone; discharges offensive smelling pus periodically." "whole left side of the head retarded in growth, left eye seems smaller."
Skin: That is a clinical state, but it is significant.
Its use in syphilis must not be overlooked. in old cases with exostoses, caries and necrosis, cases that have been mercurialized, and treated by other drugs until ulcers have developed or those affections of the nose that we have often observed in syphilitic states. He blows small pieces of bone out of the nose; great pain in the nose; nasal bones all destroyed, and the nose becomes flat as though only a soft piece of flesh with perforations.
The vulva is eaten off and the tonsils become honeycombed by syphilitic ulcers.
Lingering, low forms of ulcers and eruptions. The teeth decay or break off or ulcerate at the roots; fistulous openings from the root of the tooth, continuing to discharge.
Many a time has this remedy taken away that ulcer of the root, closed up that fistulous opening, cured the pain, saved the tooth.
"Craves cold water and is continually hungry."
Often that "all gone” sensation in the stomach. Is always eating and is relieved from eating, but like Iodine it does not last long, for soon be becomes hungry again. Such medicines are very deep. We see that they go, to the very root of assimilation and nutrition.
Chronic ulcers of the throat not necessarily syphilitic, but it is particularly useful in the old forms of syphilis; not generally so suitable in the earlier ulcers as in those that are associated with the tertiary forms, with debilitated states, with brain disease, with nervous symptoms that go on for years when the patient is supposed to be cured.
Very often the trouble will come back in the throat, and the ulcers consist of little gummatous growths. Sil. especially covers such a condition, and Sil. is also one of the most useful medicines for rooting out Mercurius.
In potentized form sil. and Merc. are inimical, yet the high potencies of Sil. will antidote crude Mercury.
This patient craves pungent, highly seasoned things. The appetite must be tickled; there must be some inducement to eat. At times the appetite is changeable in spite of the fact that he is overwhelmingly hungry; he cannot eat, yet he is > when the food is in the stomach, > after eating.
The most vicious kind of chronic diarrhea with this low feeble constitution, in insidious complaints. "Morning diarrhoea."
The itching of the anus is sometimes intense; protrusion of the anus during defecation; profuse haemorrhage after stool; constipation with piles; itching around and in anus, in perineum, etc,
This drug is also suitable in the dropsy of drunkards. They are very often liver dropsies. Old cicatrices become red around the edge surrounded by itching vesicles, itching violently; squamous eruptions upon the body; dry, cutaneous eruptions upon the body, very scaly.
"Sensation as if a burning vapor were emitted from the pores of the body."
Especially under the covers there is this sensation of great heat, tremendous, like steam. It is not in fever. He has no fever but it is a chronic state of giving out heat without thirst, or increase of temperature.
Gelsemium
Weather: If you will observe the weather conditions in sharp climates, such as Minnesota, Massachusetts and Canada, you will find that the cold spells are very intense and that people when exposed, come down with complaints very rapidly and violently.
That is the way the Bell. and Acon. cases come on, but Gelsemium complaints do not come from, such causes nor appear that way. Its complaints are more insidious and come on with a degree of slowness.
A Gels. cold develops as symptoms several days after the exposure, while the Acon. cold comes on a few hours after exposure. The Aconite child exposed during the day in dry, cold weather will have croup before midnight. But in the South diseases are very slow. Like the people themselves, their organs are very slow, and their reaction is slow.
Their colds are not taken from the violent cold, but from getting overheated. Hence, they take colds and fevers of a low malarial type; they have congestive headaches and congestive complaints that do not come on suddenly. When we think of the climate, and consider the people, and the pace of remedies, we see that Gels. is a remedy for warm climates, while Acon. is a remedy for colder climates.
Certain acute complaints in the North will be like Aconite, while similar complaints will have symptoms in the warmer climate like Gels. The colds and fevers of the mild winters will be more likely to run to this medicine, whereas the colds and fevers of a violent winter will be more likely to run to Bell. and Acon.
It is true that Acon. has complaints in hot weather, fevers and dysentery of hot weather, but they are different from the complaints of winter.
Gels. has been used mostly in acute troubles. In lingering acute troubles and in those resembling the chronic it is very useful, but in chronic miasms it is not the remedy. It is only a short-acting remedy, though slow in its beginning. In this it is like Bryonia. Bry. complaints come on slowly, and hence it is suitable for fevers coming on in the southern climate, but it also has sudden violent complaints, though not to the extent we find in Bell.
Complaints: The complaints of Gels. are largely congestive. Cerebral hyperemia, determination of blood to the brain and to the spinal cord. The extremities become cold and the head and back become hot. The symptoms are manifested largely through the brain and spinal cord. In connection with brain affections there are convulsions of the extremities, crampings of the fingers and toes and of the muscles of the back.
Coldness of the fingers and toes; sometimes the extremities are icy cold to the knees, while the head is hot and the face purple. During the congestion the face is purple and mottled. The eyes are engorged, the pupils dilated (sometimes contracted), the eyes are in a state of marked congestion with lachrymation and twitching.
The patient feels dazed and talks as if he were delirious; incoherent, stupid, forgetful. It is like this in intermittent fever that gradually develops towards a congestive chill. Great coldness running up the back from the lower part of the spine to the back of the head. Shuddering, as if ice were rubbed up the back.
The pains also extend up the back. With the coldness of the extremities, the very dark red countenance, the dazed condition of the mind, the glassy eyes and dilated pupils, we have the neck drawn back and rigidity of the muscles of the back of the neck, so that the neck cannot be straightened, and there are violent pains up the back and coldness in the spine.
This state would remind one of cerebro-spinal meningitis. Pain in the base of the brain and in the back of the neck. With all states there is a very hot skin and a high temperature, with coldness of the extremities. Sometimes the troubles are ushered in with a violent chill.
This is a very important remedy to study when such symptoms are present in intermittents and in a few days the tongue begins to coat, nausea comes on, ending in vomiting of bile, and instead of there being an intermission a continued fever extends from one paroxysm into another, with a higher temperature in the afternoon.
The chill practically subsides, leaving a state which has the appearance of typhoid, with dry tongue, not much thirst and marked head symptoms, dazed in mind. If this continues many days delirium and all the features of typhoid will come on and the fever will change its type altogether from the intermittent to the continued.
In congestive chill with high temperature occurring in the afternoon, the chill part of it subsiding and the fever becoming continued, Gels. is a useful remedy. It is also a very important remedy in afternoon fevers without chill in infants and in children. You will find in malarial districts that it is a common thing for the infants to have remittent attacks, while the adults are having intermittents. it is only occasionally that you will see a child or infant shake with a distinct chill, but they often go into a remittent fever, an afternoon fever which will subside along towards morning, to be followed the next afternoon by fever. With Gels. the child will lie as still as in Bry. but there is more congestion to the head there is the dark red face and duskiness like Bry.
Running through the febrile complaints, in the spinal meningitis, in congestion of the brain, in intermittents or remittents that change to a continued fever, and even in a cold when the patient is sneezing and has hot face and red eyes, there is one grand feature, viz., a feeling of great weight and tiredness in the entire body and limbs.
The head cannot be lifted from the pillow, so tired and so heavy is it, and there is such a great weight in the limbs. The Bry. patient lies quietly because if lie moves the pains are worse. He has an aversion to motion, because he is conscious that it would cause an increase of suffering.
The heart is feeble and the pulse is feeble, soft and irregular. There is palpitation during the febrile state. Palpitation, with weakness and irregularity of the pulse. There is a sense of weakness and goneness in the region of the heart, and this weakness and goneness often extend into the stomach, involving the whole lower part of the left side of the chest and across the stomach, creating a sensation of hunger, like Ignatia and Sepia. There is a hysterical element running through Gels. and it has the nervous hunger, or gnawing.
There are cardiac nervous affections like Digitalis, Cactus and Sepia. Sepia is not known to be as great a heart remedy as Cactus, but it has cured many cases of heart troubles. Sepia has cured endocarditis, and a remedy that will take hold in endocarditis and root it out must be a deep acting remedy. He feels that if he ceases to move the heart will cease to beat.
The headaches are of the congestive type. The most violent pain is in the occiput, and it is felt sometimes as a hammering. Every pulsation is felt like the blow of a hammer in the base of the skull. These headaches are so violent that the patient can not stand up, but will lie perfectly exhausted, as if paralyzed from the pain. There is an occipital headache that compels walking or rolling the head.
There is commonly relief from lying in bed, bolstered up by pillows, with the head perfectly quiet The face is flushed and dusky and the patient is dazed. After the headache progresses a while, the whole head seems to enter into a state of congestion, there is one great pain, too dreadful to describe, and the patient loses his
ability to tell symptoms and appears dazed; lies bolstered up in bed, eyes glassy, pupils dilated, face mottled, and extremities cold.
Gels. has also headaches of a neuralgic character in the temples and over the eyes, with nausea and aggravation from vomiting. The headache is relieved by passing a copious quantity of urine; that is, the urine which has probably been scanty becomes free and then the headache subsides.
There is much nervous excitement. Complaints from fear, from embarrassment, from shock that is attended with fear, from sudden surprises that are attended with fright. A soldier going into battle has an involuntary stool; involuntary discharges from fright and surprises accompanying fright. On becoming suddenly overwhelmed by some surprise he becomes faint, weak and exhausted, he becomes tired in all the limbs and unable to resist opposing circumstances. His heart palpitates. This is similar to Arg. nit. Arg. nit. has the peculiar condition that when dressing for an opera a sudden attack of diarrhea comes on, causing more or less sudden exhaustion, and she must go several times before she can finish dressing.
They who are to appear before an audience are detained because of a sudden attack of diarrhoea. A lady has an attack of diarrhoea when about to meet friends over whom she expects to become excited at the meeting. The anticipation brings on the diarrhoea. Such a state is Arg. nit. These medicines are so closely related to each other that there are times when they will appear to do the work of each other.
Then we have paralytic affections of the sphincters, and so with the febrile conditions there is involuntary loss of stool and urine. There is also paralytic weakness of the extremities and of the hands. With paralytic states there is aching along the spine and in the muscles of the back; drawing, cramping in the muscles of the back and aching under the left shoulder blade.
There are many disturbances of vision; double vision, dimness of vision, appearance of a gauze before the eyes; confusion of vision and blindness. These symptoms come on before going into attacks, in connection with chill, at the coming on of sick headaches and congestive headaches. All sorts of objects are seen; the field of vision appears full of black spots, or full of smoke or little waves of various colors. It is useful in inflammation of all the tissues of the eye and of the eyelids. The eyeballs oscillate laterally when using them.
Drooping of the eyelids or ptosis is a marked feature and is in its paralytic nature.
The muscles are relaxed, they do not hold the lids tip. The lids close when he is looking steadily; they simply fall down over the eyes.
The patient in general is thirstless, and it is the exception that there is much thirst. It has a profuse, exhaustive sweat and is aggravated from motion, or rather motion seems to be impossible. It seems that he is unable to move, that be is too weak to move, and this runs through all complaints. At times it is a remedy for coryza, with sneezing and running of water from the nose, with coldness in the extremities, and the trouble will go down into the throat and produce sore throat, with redness, tumefaction, enlargement of the tonsils, hot head and congested face.
With this, as with the other febrile conditions, there is heaviness of the extremities. The red face, the heaviness of the extremities and sore throat that has come on gradually, a little worse from day to day, until it has become a severe throat, will lead you to Gels., especially if there is paralytic weakness all over, and as the throat trouble progresses the food and drink come back through the nose.
This is due to a paralysis of the muscles of deglutition. The tongue also becomes paralyzed and don not perform its work in an orderly way. There are times when the paralytic weakness is not sufficiently marked
to account for things seen, but there is an incoordination of muscles and he is awkward. He undertakes to, take hold of an article and takes hold of something else. When he does grasp his hands feel weak. He is awkward and clumsy and the muscles do this and that and something not ordered to do.
The trembling incoordination and paresis are especially noticed during high excitement and afterwards, and these states occur with the febrile condition and remain sometimes after. Useful in paralytic cases that begin with fevers. Tearing is felt in the nerves all over the body and seems to be due to an inflammatory condition. It has cured sciatica, with tearing pains, associated with great weakness of the limbs.
Loss of sensation is sometimes found; numbness of the end of the nose, of the ears, of the tongue, of the fingers, of the hands and feet, numbness, here and there, of the skin.
In the male, the sexual organs arc in the same condition as the patient in general. The semen dribbles away; there is impotency, no ability to perform the sexual act; the sexual organs are relaxed.
The sleep is greatly disturbed. He cannot go to sleep; every excitement keeps him awake. During marked febrile conditions he has a profound sleep or coma. When he is not in this comatose sleep during congestion he is in a state of nervous excitement in which he lies awake thinking, and yet thinks of nothing in particular, because his!mind will not work in an orderly way.
The symptoms of Gels. may be present in inflammation of any organ, uterus or ovaries, stomach, the lungs and of the rectum. It has congestion of organs, but it has also high grade inflammation. There is nothing peculiar in the inflammation itself that would indicate Gels., neither should Gels. ever be given because there is inflammation, but when the mental symptoms are present, the delirium, the flushed face, the determination of blood to the head with the cold extremities, the great heaviness of the limbs, the disturbance of sensation, the paralysis of sphincters, then Gels. would be good for inflammation of any organ of the body.
In a most distressing and violent, rapidly spreading erysipelas that seems destined to cause death in a few days all the symptoms point to Gels., and though Gels. may not have produced erysipelas, it will stop the progress of the disease in a few hours and the patient will go on to a quick recovery.
Many times when erysipelas has spread over the face and scalp and in the most dangerous manner with the dusky red color that belongs to Gels., and other symptoms such as I have described in a general way, Gels. has taken bold of the erysipelas and cured. If we master thoroughly the Materia Medica we do not stop to see if a remedy produces certain kinds of inflammation, etc., but we consider the state of the patient.
Glonoinum
Head: The most common feature in this remedy is the surging of blood to the head and to the heart. A patient often describes the state as a feeling as if all the blood in the body must be rushing around the heart, with a sense of heat or a boiling sensation in the region of the heart, or in the left side of the chest.
Again he complains of a surging in the head, a warm glowing sensation in the head or a feeling of intense glowing from the stomach or from the chest up into the head, attended at times with loss of consciousness.
There are also wave-like sensations in the head, as if the skull were being lifted up and lowered, or as if it were being expanded and contracted. Along with this there is most intense pain, sometimes as if the head
would burst, sometimes great soreness in the head, or a sense of soreness felt in the skull. Another accompaniment of the surging is great throbbing, synchronous with the heat of the heart, and when the skull has this soreness then the throbbing is like the beating of hammers, and every pulsation is painful, so that there are painful pulsations and sometimes painless pulsations.
The pulsations are tremendous and when they are greatest in the head they are felt also in the extremities. The fingers and toes pulsate, there is pulsation throughout the back, and it seems that the whole body throbs. If this continues a while the soreness in the skull is likely to come on and with it the painful throbbing, every throb is a pain. In this state, with every jar in stepping, and every motion, it seems as if the head would be crushed.
Throbbing: The throbbing becomes more painful from motion. The vomiting which attends this condition relieves. The head is relieved in the open air, it is worse in the warmth, and is often relieved from the application of cold. It is made worse by lying down, or lying, with the head low. In the extremities we have great coldness. The extremities cold, pale and perspiring, the head hot and the face flushed and purple or bright red. The pupils are dilated and the eyes red. Now, if this progresses only a little while, the tongue becomes dry, red and then brown. There is no great thirst, but the mouth is very dry. The eyelids become dry and stick to the eyeballs. At times the skin becomes dry and hot, and the face is red and glistens. All degrees of confusion of mind, even loss of consciousness, will be present.
Headaches: Have I not described to a great extent that which is seen in a typical sunstroke? It is noticeable also that Glonoine symptoms are worse in the heat of summer and relieved in winter. The dull headaches and the continuous headaches are aggravated from warm weather and ameliorated from cold.
They are worse in the sun and better in the shade. All sorts of contrivances will be resorted to by Glonoine patients to keep the sun's beat from the head. When he has had these troubles for years, and it has become a chronic state, he will never go out in the warmth of the sun without an umbrella.
Glonoine corresponds to congestive states in the head that come on suddenly, especially from heat, but also from gaslight, or from any bright light.
The headaches that book-keepers are subject to, especially in those that have at their desk, or over the head, a hot gaslight. The bright light accompanied by the heat so close to the head will make this individual subject to headaches. These headaches are relieved by going into the cold air. The head aches all day when he is at his books, and when he goes home at night and lies down the headache comes on again, and he bas to be bolstered up in bed.
He wants the head high, and cold applications to the head; the headache is relieved from a long sleep, not generally relieved from siesta. From lying down and taking a nap the headache is sometimes aggravated, but from a good long sleep, a night's sleep, he is refreshed.
His feet and hands become warm, the feverish state, and the throbbing all over the body subsides and he wakes up in the morning comfortable; but if he goes out in the sun, or goes to the gaslight, he comes home with the headache again. Since electric lights have been brought into use there is not so much heat in the light, but gas throws out an immense amount of heat in its light,
The child comes down with cerebro-spinal meningitis, the neck is drawn back, the face is intensely hot, red and shiny, the eyes congested or glassy, the head and upper part of the body are very warm, the feet and hands and lower portions of the body and the extremities are cold and covered with cold sweat.
It is a most violent congestion to the brain and spinal cord. Convulsions come on, convulsions throughout all the limbs, the neck and whole body drawn back, opisthotonos. Cold feels good to the head; heat feels good to the extremities. The warm room increases the convulsions. When the lower limbs are covered with clothing in a cool room and the windows open the convulsions are relieved and the patient breaths more easily. With this head congestion there is difficulty in breathing and audible palpitation.
The head is made worse from shaking or jar, from stooping, from bending head backwards, after lying down, when ascending steps. It is aggravated in damp weather, and in the sun, while working under the gaslight, after overheating with copious sweat, and from the touch of the hat.
The weight of the hat is a very common aggravation in headaches in school children. The little ones work all day in a hot stuffy room and feel better in the open air, but the weight of the hat seems an encumberance as in Nitric acid and Calc. phos.
The Glonoine patient is also worse from wine and from stimulants, and from mental application. When the headache is on he cannot think, and he cannot write. An additional hindrance to writing is that he trembles so that he cannot write. Trembling and throbbing of the fingers so that he is unable to do his work or perform any delicate work with the fingers or hands.
We have puerperal convulsions with such an appearance as J have described. We may have the same violence in congestive chills, or in any type of congestion of the brain.
Brain: There is a milder form of trouble that calls for its use, a condition corresponding to the chronic types of disease. This milder form exists where the patient has simply what might be called a hyperemia of the brain, a rush of blood to the head when able to be about. It comes in spells, comes in moments when be least expects it; while walking on the street he feels a surging to the brain like a flush of heat and a flush on the face, his hands tremble, and the hands and feet become cold, he breaks out in a sweat; he looks around him and does not know which way to go home, he does not know where his dwelling is.
He looks in the faces of friends and they seem strange, he loses his way when be is near home. It is a confusion which soon passes away, and he feels better again. But these spells come closer together, and constitute the earlier stages of softening of the brain. This surging of blood to the brain is attended with dizziness; he rolls and staggers, and must take hold of things, and especially does he suffer in this way from a warm day, or from the heat and light of the sun.
In threatened apoplexy, and when apoplexy has taken place, if the violent pressure keeps on, think of this remedy. The clot may not be at first in the place to take life, it may be outside of the life line, but if the congestion continues that blood clot will increase.
Such medicines as Opium and Glonoine relieve the blood pressure when the symptoms agree. They equalize the circulation, and the patient may not die. A paralytic condition in one arm or leg may go on for a while, and at the end of many weeks or months the motion may be regained, and the patient recover; whereas if the suitable remedy had not been administered to reduce that blood pressure the continued congestion would certainly have ended in death in a few days.
The stertorous breathing, the coma, the history, and the general appearance of an apoplectic patient are found in this remedy, but the intense heat that comes on in many cases of apoplexy along with the shiny skin and coldness of the extremities are the guiding features.
Opium is the most frequently indicated medicine, but it must not be administered in large doses. The highest potencies are the best and one single dose is enough.
In a case noted it says, "frantic attempts to jump from the window."
The headache was so intense that the patient became violent and attempted to jump from the window. You may rest assured that with his headache there was all this determination of blood to the head. It is enough to make one frantic to feel this continued hammering upon every fraction of the skull. He cannot lie down, and he cannot walk, because every step increases the jar, so you see why it is that the word "frantic" is wed there. The patient becomes frantic with the pain.
Another expression used is "disinclination to step around."
The patient wants the room perfectly still. If sitting up in bed, you will often find a Glonoine patient with both hands pressing upon the head with all the power possible until the arms are perfectly exhausted. He wants the head pressed upon all sides. Wants it bandaged, or a tight cap fitted down upon it.
The headache is worse from bending backward and from stooping forward. There are times when the headache is so severe that lying back upon the pillow cannot be tolerated. There is a sense of great heaviness in the head. You will notice, in reading over these congestive headaches as reported, that each patient has a different way of describing his headache and yet all have the same story to tell, that of violent determination of blood to the head.
"Some months after being violently jarred by being thrown from a carriage, a sensitiveness of the upper part of the back and neck came on."
There are two strong characteristics of Glonoine in that cure, viz: "< from wine and the < from lying down."
The other symptoms might have pointed to other remedies, but these two features are there. It is interesting when reading a case, if you have first a knowledge of the Materia Medica, to note what symptoms are verified when you do not know the Materia Medica then the case is confusing.
Now, as we glance over that description we see at once these two things verified and the rest is fairly consistent. Very commonly the pain begins in the occiput and goes to the forehead, but the whole head is in a state of throbbing.
But, we notice more particularly, the "aggravation from motion and the least noise."
This patient will sit in perfect quietude and silence for hours. You will be astonished to, know how long a Glonoine patient can sit without moving a muscle, because motion is so painful.
Also "aggravation from lying with the head low and after sleeping." it is important for you to know what that sleeping means. As I have said before, the patient very often is worse after a little sleep, but the common state is relief after a prolonged sleep. If he can sleep long enough it will subside, unless it be the congestive sleep, or coma, and then it is a different thing.
"Amelioration from cold and external pressure."
"Vertex burning hot, likewise upper part of back."
The whole crown of the head feels as if it were covered by a hot iron, as if an oven were close by. Hot, especially in the back of the neck and between the shoulders.
The burning heat seems to appear at the top of the head and extend down between the shoulders; a sensation of heat, as from a band.
"Face bluish, with a heavy, stupid expression."
The face is bright red, but if the condition becomes severe the face assumes a dusky appearance, and the longer this state lasts the more dusky it becomes; that is true with apoplexy and also with sunstroke. When the sunstroke first comes on the face is bright red, intensely hot and shiny, but as the heat increases the face grows dusky, even to purple. In all of these cerebral congestions there is a stupid, heavy expression, even going on to coma.
"Frequent deep inspirations."
With this congestion of the head there is commonly vomiting, palpitation of the heart, pain in the stomach, great difficulty in breathing and finally loss of consciousness. In another clinical case reported we read:
"Every pulsation is felt as if the head would burst."
Now, suppose the head bones were already intensely sensitive and sore and the head filled as full as possible with blood, and then you commenced hammering upon the blood column you can understand that the pain would be most intense and would soon end in stupefaction.
"Sunken eyes, bluish pallor under the eyes." "Red eyes, with photophobia; optical illusions. Black specks before the eyes; blindness." "Face pale, in spite of high fever."
In all of these cerebral congestions of great violence the pulse fluctuates; it even becomes fine and wiry and hard; sometimes becomes irregular and also slow.
Another common accompaniment of these congestions is tumefaction about the neck. The neck feels full. The collar must be opened as it causes choking, as if he would suffocate. Even in the chronic state in the one who stands upon the street corner not knowing his way home because of the surging of blood in the head, that state is accompanied by choking and the collar causes uneasiness about the neck like Lach. He chokes and swells up under the ears. There is not only a sensation, but with the sensation there is actual swelling. Tumefaction about the neck and throat, under the chin, and the glands become swollen.
The next circumstance in the text that brings forth the general aspect of the remedy is in connection with the catamenia. The menstrual flow does not appear, it is delayed, with violent congestion to the head, violent headaches and these symptoms already described. These congestions may also come on during the menstrual period. Again, if a uterine hemorrhage stops suddenly, or a copious flow from any part stops suddenly, the patient comes down with great violence and the blood rushes to the head.
There are many conditions and complaints in life where we have surging of blood to the head, when this will be the remedy wanted. Persons who are subject to palpitation with dyspnea, upon any effort, he cannot go uphill, he cannot walk along the pavement without bringing on palpitation and dyspnea; any little exertion or excitement brings on the rush of blood to the heart and fainting spells; fainting, spells in women, who are not supposed to be subject to fainting. Great weakness, palpitation, trembling of the limbs, shaking of one or both hands as with palsy.
"Laborious action of the heart" is a strong feature of the remedy; pulsation all over.
Fluttering in the region of the heart. Pulse quick, irregular, slow or quick and wiry. There are some persons that are apparently plethoric; very much affected by the slightest exertion and who have pulsation all over; pulsation in a warm room. They are sometimes relieved by opening the window if it is cool, by fanning, by cold air, by cold applications to the head. In keeping with the remedy, this is clinical application of it:
"Children get sick in the night after sitting up at an open fire or falling asleep there." "Bad effects from having the hair cut."
Bell. is generally thought of for taking cold in the head from having the hair cut. "Bad effects from being exposed to the sun's rays."
"Bad effects from sunstroke."
Graphites
The complaints of Graphites are worse morning, evening and during the NIGHT, especially before midnight. It is useful in people who are morbidly fat, or have been fat and are now emaciating; with constipation more commonly than diarrhoea; in women in these conditions whose menstrual habit is pale, late, short and scanty; catarrhal discharges that are albuminous and viscid represent to the mind some peculiar general states of the sick man not explainable and not common to diseased conditions nor to many remedies; hence, strange, rare and peculiar. Raw surfaces upon the skin are generally marked by such viscid glutinous discharges.
It is a very deep acting remedy, like all carbons, and is accompanied with induration and burning in the base of the ulcers, inflamed tissues and old cicatrices; hence, its great usefulness in cancerous growths and ulceration.
Cancerous development in old cicatrices is a strong feature of this remedy. Contraction of tendons, especially behind the knee. It has hemorrhagic oozing of pale blood. In the higher sense the patient is anaemic and chlorotic. From eruptions, catarrhal discharges, menstrual flow, ulcers, breath and perspiration there is marked offensiveness (like Carbo v., Psorinum, Kali phos., Kali ars.).
When eruptions or discharges have disappeared suddenly from any cause and grave chronic phenomena have followed Graphites is one of the medicines to be studied. Scrofulous conditions and swelling of glands; recurrent herpes upon all parts of the body and especially about the anus and genitals; burning in many parts and especially in old cicatrices; general dropsical tendency; weakness in muscles and tendons after straining them by overlifting.
Modalities: The patient is very sensitive to cold and needs warm clothing; he is sensitive to the cold in winter and to the heat in summer; he is sensitive to a warm room and desires open air which is grateful. Worse in a warm bed; complaints come on from becoming cold or heated; the headaches are worse in a warm room and better in the open air. Graphites has cured deep seated spinal complaints, and in such cases the patient delights to lie heavily covered in a cold draft from an open window.
It is easy to see in this, the resemblance to Carbo veg., which often cures when the patient wants to be fanned. Craving for air is strong in the carbons, yet often easily chilled and just as easily overheated and complaints that come from overheating are related to the carbons. This one becomes ill from being overheated; exertion makes all symptoms worse.
Motion increases all symptoms except the numbness and general feeling of stagnation which come on during rest. Extreme weakness. Weakness and desire to lie down. Paralysis in any part but especially in the lower limbs; sensation of paralysis or stagnation creeps over the body and limbs.
He is made sick by bathing and is sensitive to cold, damp weather. What there is in the general life to cause eruptions to come out in the bends of the joints must be left for others to explain, but such is the case with this wonderful remedy.
Convulsions: The same may be said of rawness and excoriation in the same regions. Cataleptic conditions are very marked in which the patient is conscious but without power to move or speak; tremulous sensation throughout the body; sudden sinking of strength; sudden weakness. Constriction in many parts. It has cured many kinds of convulsions. It is not the remedy for the convulsion, but in chronic sickness where the convulsion is but one of many elements it is often suitable. It has cured epilepsy and hysterio-epilepsy and epileptiform spasms many times when the totality of symptoms furnished the basis for the prescription.
A careful comparison of the symptoms shows that this remedy acts predominantly on the left side of the body. The patient is oversensitive to pain and outer parts are very sensitive.
Pains: The pains are burning, drawing, pressing. Soreness. Stitching and tearing. Numbness is more characteristic than pain. The formation of fissures in all the commissures and in the anus with cracked and bleeding skin in many parts with much hardening; the tendency to grow wens on the scalp and elsewhere are features of this remedy not to be overlooked, and when coupled with the mental symptoms form such a strong and striking image of perverted vital action that the neophyte should not overlook Graphites.
It is as broad and deep as Sulphur, showing the great similarity to this great remedy in chronic cases.
Mind: The patient becomes very restless when attempting close mental work and there is a marked dread of mental work. The mental depression is extreme, and it is made worse by music; her sadness is so great that she thinks only of death and salvation. Grief and vexation cause of recurrence of all her distressing mental sufferings.
Her moods are constantly changing; while she may recall all the events of youth, recent events are forgotten; slow of thought and weakness of mind worse in the morning; often excited, hurried and exhilarated in the evening; extremely fretful and impatient; irritable about trifles and very critical. Irresolution is a marked symptom.
She cannot make, up her mind to do or not to do. Extreme activity of mind in the evening and first half of the night, which, prevents sleep until midnight; apprehensive and distressed in the. morning and excited. in the evening; extreme anxiety even to desperation.
Vertigo in the morning on waking; in the evening; on looking upwards; on rising from stooping; compelled to lie down; with inclination to fall forward.
When the above general symptoms strongly predominate in any given sickness the following particulars will be cured by this remedy.

Helleborus Niger
Brain and mind: in all the complaints of Helleborus stupefaction occurs in greater or less degree. Sometimes it is a complete stupor, sometimes a partial stupor, but it is always stupefaction and sluggishness.
Hellebore is useful in affections of the brain, spinal cord, the general nervous system and mind, but especially in acute inflammatory diseases of the brain and spinal cord and their membranes, and in troubles bordering on insanity. There is a peculiar kind of imbecility or stupefaction of the body and mind.
The extreme state is unconsciousness. Complete unconsciousness in connection with cerebral congestion, or inflammation which has gone on to hydrocephalus, cerebro-spinal meningitis, or inflammation of the brain, with stupefaction.
Even early in the disease Hellebore lacks the wildness and acute delirium found is Stramonium and Belladonna. It is passive. Again, it fits in after the wildness of the delirium has passed away and, the patient has settled down into a state of stupefaction. The patient lies upon the back, eyes partly open, rolling the head, mouth open, tongue dry, eyes lusterless, staring into space. Staring at the individual talking. Waiting a long time to answer, or not answering at all.
Violent attacks of brain trouble frequently come to a sudden end, but those that are more passive linger, and that is where Hellebore comes in. The Hellebore case will linger for weeks and sometimes months in this state of stupefaction, gradually emaciating.
He lies upon the back with the limbs drawn up; he looks pale and sickly. When questioned he answers slowly. The text says:
"Stupefaction bordering on insensibility." Another common expression is: "Diminished power of the mind over the body."
The muscles will not act; they will not obey the will. It is a sort of paralytic state, but "stupefaction" expresses it. Cannot project ideas; cannot rivet the attention, cannot concentrate the mind. The patient appears semi-idiotic.
Delirium is not common, and when present it is muttering. There is more stupefaction, more "do nothing," more "say nothing," than delirium.
Yet there is evidently confusion of mind; he cannot think. In many instances, very late in the disease, the patient can be roused up, and he will act as if he were attempting to think, as if he were attempting to answer, attempting to move. But he simply stares at the doctor with eyes partly open, with a dazed expression on his face, and picks his finger ends.
When questioned the Hellebore patient is not able to tell you what he has in mind, unless considerably aroused and agitated. But when so aroused he will talk about spirits, or say that he sees devils. He sees in his imagination those images that he has read about, or seen pictured, as the devil, with horns and a tail. A young person who has never heard of the devil, or of spirits, would not have that form of hallucination in his delirium. The hallucinations are shaped in accordance with what he has been taught to imagine.
Hellebore has a peculiar quasi-hysterical condition - a form of insanity. She imagines she has sinned away her day of grace. Like Aurum, she believes that she is doing wrong, that she is committing an unpardonable sin. That is as near as the remedy approaches to insanity,
"An old woman having been accused of theft by the women around took it so much to heart that she hanged herself. This suicide produced such an effect on the women of the village that one after another accused herself of having caused the death of the old woman."
Child: The most striking type in Hellebore is the sick child. It comes in especially in children between two and ten years of age. The staring -lying on the back and staring with half-closed eyes, is typical of the remedy. Sometimes the lips move without any sound. The lips move as if the child wishes to say something, but on further questioning the words he wished to speak are lost, forgotten.
In hydrocephalus there is a sharp scream, the brain cry. The child will cry out in sleep. He will carry the hand to the head and shriek, like Apis. But the Apis hydrocephalus is far more active and acute.
The Apis patient kicks the covers off; this patient does not mind the covers, he does not mind anything. He is not easily disturbed. He lies upon his back with the limbs drawn up; often making automatic motions with the arms and legs. Sometimes one side is paralyzed, but the other keeps up automatic motions.
Hellebore is useful in the low form of disease known as "apathetic typhoid." These same symptoms guide to the remedy. Indifferent to all external impressions.
Rarely much disturbed by being touched, or by being covered too warmly, or by not being covered at all.
He does not seem to be sensitive to heat, or cold, or pricking, or handling or pinching. Listlessness. What is called in the text "stubborn silence" is more an apathetic silence, an inability to speak. It appears as if he refused to answer, but he does not; he does not know how to answer; he cannot think.
Fixed ideas in persons who are said to be just a little "off their balance,” a little queer. And that fixed idea will stay; there is no use trying to argue him out of it. The woman gets a fixed idea that she is going to die on a certain day, and nothing can get it out of her head. This is not like Aconit, because there is no fear of death.
Aconite has fear of death and fixes the time of death. Fixed idea that she has committed some sin, which she will at times name and describe, or perhaps only mention vaguely - but it is very real to her,
Mind 2: When able to be about the patient appears to be sad, because she sits and says nothing, and seems to be in a woeful mood. But there is not that great lamentation, with walking the floor and wringing the hands that we find in Aurum.
It is an apathetic state; she appears sad and melancholy, whereas perhaps she does little thinking. Any attempt at consolation, so long as the patient is able to think, only aggravates the trouble. Like Natrum muriaticum, the complaints are aggravated by consolation, but the complaints of Natrum muriaticum are not at all like these.
If the Hellebore patient is able to meditate upon his symptoms, they seem to grow better.
Sometimes there are convulsive motions in this remedy, but they are more likely to be automatic. Motions that seem to have nothing to do with the will. He simply makes motions, like one moving in an absent- minded state.
The Helleborus patient is benumbed everywhere. The whole sensorium is in a benumbed state, a stupefaction, a blunting of general sensibility. The text says:
"Vision unimpaired."
Nevertheless he sees imperfectly; he does not regard the object his gaze is fixed upon; that is, his range of vision appears to be correct, yet if questioned a little as to what be saw, he has no recollection of it; it has made no impression upon his memory or his mind.
Vertigo and head: Vertigo, with nausea and vomiting. Vertigo from stooping. With the general stupefaction the head rolls and tosses. The child lies upon the back and rolls the head from side to side. The eyes are partly open, arid he keeps boring the back of the head into the pillow. This is partly unconscious and partly to relieve the drawing in the muscles of the back of the neck. These muscles keep shortening, as the disease progresses, just as they do in cerebro-spinal meningitis; until the head is drawn back as far as it can go.
There is burning heat in the head; shooting pains; pressive pains in the head from congestion. Violent occipital headache. Dull aching in the occiput; benumbed feeling in the occiput. A feeling like wood fullness, congestion and pressure.
The headaches, the motions of the head and the appearance of the face are those occurring in congestion of the brain. I have seen children, after passing through a moderately acute but rather passive first stage, lie in this stupid state, needing Hellebore for weeks before they received it.
When it was given repair set in; not instantly, but gradually. The remedy acts slowly in these slow, stubborn, stupid cases of brain and spinal trouble. Some. times there is no apparent change until the day after the remedy is administered or even the next night, when there comes a sweat, a diarrhea, or vomiting - areaction.
They must not be interfered with no remedy must be given. They are signs of reaction. If the child has vitality enough to recover, he will now recover. If the vomiting is stopped by any remedy that will stop it, the Hellebore will be antidoted. Let the vomiting or the diarrhoea or the sweat alone, and it will pass away during the day.
The child will become warm, and in a few days will return to consciousness and then what will take place? just imagine these benumbed fingers and hands and limbs, this benumbed skin everywhere. What would be the most natural, thing to develop as evidence of the rousing up of this stupid child?, it is necessary for you to know this.
It is not really a part of the teaching of the homoeopathic Materia Medica, but you must know what to expect after giving this remedy.
Clinical observation: It is a clinical observation which you will - see if you see Hellebore cases, and Zincum cases.
Zincum is, if possible, even more profound in its dreadful state of stupefaction than Hellebore. Well, that child's fingers will commence to tingle. As he comes back to his normal nervous condition, the fingers commence to tingle, the nose and ears tingle, and the child begins to scream and toss back and forth and roll about the bed. The neighbors will come in and say,
"I would send that doctor away unless he gives, something to help that child;" but just as sure as you do it you will have a dead baby in twenty-four hours. That child is getting well; let him alone. You will never be able to manage one of these cases if you do not take the father into a room by himself and tell him just how the case will proceed.
Do not take the mother; do not tell her a word about it, unless she is an unusually excellent mother, because that is her child, and she is sympathetic, and she will cry when she hears that child cry; she will lose her head and will insist upon the father turning you out of doors.
But you take the father aside beforehand and tell him what is going to happen; explain it to him so he will see it for himself; and tell him that if this is not permitted to go on, that if the remedy is interfered with, he will lose his child.
It is not so much the awful pains, but it is the itching, tingling and formication that cause the appearance of extreme agony. Sometimes in every part of the child's body it is a week before all these symptoms go away of themselves but they will go away, if left alone.
All this will make you nervous. Do not stay and watch the case too long, because if you do you will change the remedy. I never heard of one solitary cure like, these in the hands of an Old School doctor,
The face has a very sickly appearance; sunken, gradually emaciating. It has a sooty appearance, just as if soot had settled in the nostrils and in the corners of the eyes. You will say that the patient is going to die. Quite likely without Hellebore. The remedy fits the kind of cases that the allopath knows nothing about and has no remedy for.
His prognosis is always unfavorable. The face, of course, expresses the mental symptoms. Wrinkled forehead, bathed in cold sweat. Paleness of the face and heat of the head. Twitching, of the muscles of the face.
We find that knitting of the brow and wrinkling of the forehead in just this kind of brain trouble. We find a similar kind of wrinkling in Lycopodium, but the trouble is in the lungs. In this remedy the nostrils are dilated and sooty. Nor much flapping, but extremely dilated. The eyeballs are glassy and the lids sticky.
There is violent thirst in these fevers, and unusual canine hunger. The nausea and vomiting are nondescript. In the early part of the proving there are diarrhoea and dysentery; with copious white gelatinous stool; stool consisting solely of pale tenacious mucus. And then comes paralytic constipation, and these prostrated, emaciated brain cases, such as described, will lie for days without stool, or any action of the bowels.
After a day or two they will not even respond to injections. Little, hard, dry stool. Again, when reaction comes, it very commonly comes with a diarrhea, or a sweat, or vomiting; perhaps with all three of these conditions.
The urine is retained or suppressed; sometimes it dribbles away passes unconsciously. Urine passed in a feeble stream; bloody urine.
The patient lies on the back, with his limbs drawn up; or slides down in bed. Great debility; great relaxation; the muscles refuse to act. Convulsions of sucklings. Epilepsy with consciousness. Traumatic tetanus. Constant somnambulism cannot be roused to full consciousness. Soporous sleep.
Hepar Sulphur
Coldness: The Hepar patient is chilly. He is sensitive to the cold and wants an unusual amount of clothing when in cold air. He wants the sleeping room very warm and can endure much heat in the room, many degrees warmer than a healthy person ordinarily desires, He has no endurance in the cold and all his complaints are made worse in the cold. If he becomes cold in sleep his complaints come on or if he is out in the cold, dry wind, complaints come on; inflammatory and rheumatic complaints appear.
The exposure of hand or foot at night in bed brings on symptoms. He wants the covers drawn close about the neck when in bed. This patient is also oversensitive to impressions, to surroundings and to pain. What with an ordinary person would only be an ache or disagreeable sensation becomes with Hepar an intense
suffering.
Pains: But the pains of Hepar may be very severe, very sharp. Inflamed spots, eruptions, boils or suppurations are full of sharp pains. This is so intense that it is described at times, as a sticking and jagging like sharp sticks.
The pains in ulcers are often felt like sticks; intense and sharp as if sticks were jagging the ulcer. This sensation is often expressed by the patient suffering from sore throat. Lip feels as if he had swallowed a fish bone, or stick. This is in keeping with the general character, because it is present everywhere, in inflammations, ulcers, pustules, boils and eruptions; all seem to have sticks in them or some thing jagging.
Eruptions are sensitive, to touch. This accords with the oversensitiveness of the nerves found everywhere. The Hepar patient faints with pain, even from slight pain.
Mind: This remedy belongs to patients that are called delicate, that are oversensitive to impressions. The mind takes part in this oversensitiveness and manifests itself by a state of extreme irritability.
Every little thing that disturbs the patient makes him intensely angry, abusive and impulsive. The impulses will overwhelm him and make him wish to kill his best friend in an instant. Impulses also that are without cause sometimes crop out in Hepar.
A man may have a sudden impulse to stab his friend. A barber has an impulse to cut the throat of his patron while in the chair. Mothers may have an impulse to throw the child into the fire or an impulse to set herself on fire; an impulse to do violence and to destroy. These symptoms increase to insanity and then the impulses are often carried out. It becomes a mania to set fire to things.
The patient is quarrelsome, hard to get along with; nothing pleases; everybody disturbs oversensitiveness to persons, to people and to places.
He desires a constant change of persons and things and surroundings and each new surrounding or person or thing again displeases and makes him irritated. With this irritability of temper and physical irritability
there is a tendency to suppuration in parts. Localized inflammations incline to suppurate, especially in glands and cellular tissue do we have suppuration and ulcers.
The glands of the neck, axilla and groin and the mammary glands swell, become hard and suppurate. First the hard swellings with the feeling as if they had sticks jagging in them, then it becomes highly inflamed and red over the part and ultimately it suppurates, discharges and heals slowly.
The bone even suppurates and takes on necrosis and caries. Felons around the root of the nail and ends of the fingers. The nail suppurates and loosens and comes off. Sensation of splinters under the nails, even when they do not suppurate.
The nails become hard and brittle. Warts crack open and bleed, sting and burn and suppurate. Hepar is especially useful in felons in such a constitution as described, but sometimes you will have nothing more than the fact that the patient is a scrawny, chilly patient, who is always taking cold and subject to felons. I have often had to give Hepar on no better information and have known it to stop the tendency to felons. It also competes with Silica.
The patient is often scrawny, and has a tendency to enlargement of glands. The lymphatic glands are generally hard and enlarged, They are chronically enlarged without suppuration, and at any cold that comes on some particular gland may suppurate.
The catarrhal state: is general.
There is no mucous membrane exempt, but especially do we have catarrh of the nose, ears, throat, larynx and chest. The Hepar patient is subject to coryza. In some instances the colds settle in the nose and then there will be much discharge, with sneezing every, time he goes into a cold wind.
The cold winds bring on sneezing and running from the nose, first of a watery character and finally ending in a thick, yellow, offensive discharge.
Discharges: These offensive discharges smell like decomposed cheese, and this characteristic runs through the remedy.
The discharges from all parts of the body smell like old cheese. The discharges from ulcers are offensive, and have a decomposed, cheesy smell. It has discharges running through it also that smell sour, and this is also a general because it modifies all things that can be sour.
The babies are always sour in spite of much washing. Or it may be noticed by the members of the family that one of the family always smells sour, has a sour perspiration. The discharges from ulcers are sour, and also discharges from, mucous membranes. The discharge from the nose becomes copious, and causes ulceration in patches.
Throat and cough: The throat has a catarrhal condition; the whole pharynx is in a catarrhal state with copious discharge. Throat extremely sensitive to touch; pain as if full of splinters; pain on swallowing. The larynx also is painful on talking; painful as a bolus of food goes down behind the larynx, and painful to touch with the hand.
There is a loss of voice, and a dry, hoarse bark in adults, especially in the mornings and evenings. Every time he goes out in the dry, cold wind, he becomes hoarse, loses the voice and coughs. It is a dry, hoarse, barking
cough. Inspiring cold air will increase the cough and putting the hand out of bed will increase the pain in the larynx or cough.
Putting the hand or foot out of bed brings a general aggravation of all the complaints of Hepar. Putting the hand out of bed accidentally when sleeping will bring on cough, and cause sneezing. The larynx has its catarrhal state, and in oversensitive children this catarrhal state becomes a croup.
Sensitive children that are exposed during the day in a cold, dry wind, or cold air, come down next morning with a violent attack of croup. The Hepar croup is worse in the morning and in the evening; evening until midnight. Sometimes cases that at first call for Aconite run into Hepar.
The Acon. croup comes on with great violence, worse in the evening before midnight. The child wakes up from its first sleep with a hoarse, barking croup. A dose of Aconit may prove entirely sufficient; or it may be only a palliative.
The child goes to sleep and along towards morning, or at least sometime after midnight, there is another attack, which shows that Acon. was not sufficient. Such a case will be controlled by Hepar.
When the croup comes on after midnight and the child wakes up frightened, suffocating, rouses up in bed with a dry, hoarse and ringing cough, which rings like a dry whoop, then Spongia will nearly always be the remedy, and again if Spongia palliates it and it is not sufficiently deep and there is a morning aggravation which shows that the trouble is returning Hepar follows. Acon., Hepar and Spongia are closely related to each other and they are truly great croup remedies.
Dry, paroxysmal cough from evening until midnight and sometimes lasting all night, with choking, gagging and crouping; some loose coughing in the daytime; rawness and scraping the larynx; worse in cold air or uncovering hand or foot in bed.
The catarrhal state is sometimes lower down in the trachea, and the trachea becomes extremely sore from much coughing. The patient has been coughing days and weeks and has the morning and evening aggravations; a rattling, barking cough with great soreness of the chest in an oversensitive and chilly patient.
The cough is attended with choking and gagging, even to vomiting; it is worse in the cold air, and from putting the band out of bed. He coughs and sweats. There is much sweating the whole night, without relief. Sweating all night without relief belongs to a great many complaints of Hepar. He sweats easily, so that with the cough and on the slightest exertion he is fairly drenched with perspiration.
Ears: It has catarrhal affections of the ear.
A sudden inflammation comes on in the middle ear, an abscess forms, the drum of the car ruptures and there is a bloody discharge and sticking, tearing pains in the inflamed ear. There is first a sensation of stopping up of the ear, then, bursting and pressure in the ear, and then perforation of the drum.
There is also an inflammatory condition causing a discharge that is foetid, or a bloody yellow, purulent discharge, thick, with cheesy particles and smelling like old cheese.
Eyes: Hepar sometimes is bad on the oculist.
When it is indicated, it cures eyes very quickly, so that the oculist does not have a very long case and it does away with the necessity for washes in the hands of the specialist. From the eyes we have the same offensive thick, purulent discharge. Inflammation of the eyes attended with, little ulcers.
Ulcers of the cornea, granulations, bloody, offensive discharge from the eyes. The eyes look red, the lids are inflamed, the edges are turned out and the margin of the lids become ulcerated. In all sorts of so called scrofulous affections, the eye conditions may be covered by Hepar when the constitutional state is present.
The constitutional state of the patient is the only guide to the remedy. Many times the eye symptoms are nondescript. You have only an inflamed eye with catarrhal discharge, and for this you could give a large number of the anti-psorics; but when you go into the state of the patient and find these general symptoms, then this remedy will cure.
The general symptoms will guide to the remedy that will cure the eyes. You will see that the specialist for the eyes is often limited unless he knows how to secure all the symptoms of the patient and selects the remedy upon the totality of the symptoms.
Bladder: There are other catarrhal, conditions. Catarrh of the bladder, with purulent discharges in the urine and copious muco-purulent deposits. Ulcers of the bladder. The walls of the bladder become hardened, so that it has almost no power to expel its contents, and the urine passes in a slow stream or in drops, or in the male the stream falls down perpendicularly. No ability to expel the urine with force. It is a paresis. There is burning in the bladder and frequent, almost constant, urging to urinate. It has also a catarrhal state of the urethra that resembles gonorrhoea, and it has been a very useful remedy in chilly patients with gleety discharge of long standing. Thick discharge of a white, cheesy character. Ulcers and little inflammatory spots along the urethra.
There is a sticking sensation here and there along the urethra and when passing urine a sensation of a splinter in the urethra. Copious leucorrhoea with the same offensive, cheesy smell.
Leucorrhea: The leucorrhea is so copious that she is compelled to wear a napkin, and the napkins, I have been told by women who have been cured by Hepar, are so offensive that they must be taken away and washed at once because the odor permeates the rooms.
This horribly offensive odor that is so permeating is often cured by Kali phos. It has really one of the most penetrating of odors, so much so that when a woman suffers from this leucorrhoea the odor can be detected when she enters the room.
A very important sphere for Hepar is after mercurialisation. Many old people are walking the street at the present day who have been the victims of Calomel, who have been salivated, who have taken blue pill for recurrent bilious spells, to "tap the liver,” until finally they get into a state of chilliness felt, as it were, in the bone.
They sweat much about the head, they ache in the bones, and every change of weather to cold, and every cold, damp spell affects them. They, are like barometers. Hepar is the remedy for that state.
They go into diseases of the bone easily and are always shivering. While they have periods of aggravation from warmth, as a general rule they are chilly subjects, and feel the cold easily. In the more acute affections of Mercury there is an aggravation from the warmth of the bed, but the old subjects who have been years ago poisoned with it get almost bloodless, and they become chilly; they cannot get- clothing enough ib keep them warm.
They become withered and shriveled, and have rheumatic affections about the joints. Then it is that the symptoms of Hepar agree and it becomes a valuable antidote to that state of mercurialisation.
Hepar is also a complement and antidote to potentized Mercury. When Merc. has been administered and has done all it can do as a curative remedy, or when it has acted improperly and has some, what mixed up the case and it is necessary to follow it with the natural complement or antidote and prepare for another series, Hepar is to be thought of as one of the natural followers of Merc. it is well known that Merc. is not followed well by Silica. Sil. does not do useful work when Merc. is still acting or has been acting.
This is the time that Hepar becomes an intercurrent remedy. Sil. follows well after Hepar, and Hepar follows well after Merc., and thus becomes an intercurrent in that series.
In old syphilitic cases when the symptoms agree Hepar is a very full and complete remedy. It corresponds to the majority of symptoms of syphilis, and it only needs to correspond to the symptoms of the individual patient when he is syphilitic to be indicated. Thus in old cases who have been mercurialized, who have had the symptoms suppressed so that the disease is latent and ready to crop out at any time, Hepar will come in and have a decided effect upon the syphilis and upon the mercury.
It will straighten matters out and cause a development that will lead to clear prescribing. In this relationship to syphilis and mercury Hepar is closely allied to Staph., Asa f., Nit. acid, Sil., etc.
Especially Hepar the remedy in those cases of syphilis where great quantities of mercury have been taken, until it is no longer able to suppress the symptoms of the disease; in old cases when the syphilitic miasm attacks the bones of the nose and they sink in, or a great ulceration takes place; those cases you sometimes see walking around the street, with a big patch over the nose or over the opening that leads down into the nasal cavity.
Nose: When there is severe pain in the region of the nasal bones, the bridge of the nose is so sensitive that it cannot be touched and in the root of the nose there is a sensation as if a splinter were sticking in. For offensive discharge from the nose, foetid oezena in an old case, which has been mercurialized, who is chilly in his very bones, think of Hepar. It has cured many such cases; it has healed up the ulcers; it has cured the catarrhal state, and it has hastened the healing up of the portions of diseased bone, by hastening the suppuration and has returned the patient to an orderly state.
Throat: As we go into the syphilitic affections that lead into the throat, we find ulcers of the soft palate which eat away the uvula, small ulcers which finally unite and destroy the soft palate and then commence to work upon the osseous portion of the roof of the mouth.
The odor that comes from that mouth when it is opened to show the throat is extremely offensive; very often like spoiled cheese. The medicines that are especially related, or especially useful in this form of ulceration in old syphilitics, will be Kali bi., Lach., Merc. cor., Merc. and Hepar, but in those syphilitic cases that have been mercurialized Hepar and Nitric acid should be thought of.
Nitric acid is very closely related to Hepar; it is just as chilly; it has the sensation of sticks in the throat and in inflamed parts. It has fine ulcers in the throat, upon the tonsils and in the larynx. Nitric acid competes with Hepar.
You think of the two together. Both have sensation of a fish bone or stick in the throat.
The cartilages of the larynx become attacked in syphilitic affections and old mercurial affections. When the case is not of syphilitic origin but is of sycotic origin, small or large white gelatinous polypi form in the
larynx and they are sore, causing loss of voice, or cracked voice; when they cause choking or uneasiness, Hepar is one of the remedies. Hepar, Calc., Arg. nit and Nit. ac. and sometimes Thuja are the remedies related to such conditions.
Genitals: Again, in the earlier syphilitic manifestations, the chancre has the feeling of a stick in it; then comes the formation of a bubo that may be either non-suppurative or a suppurating gland, associated with a chancre or a harmless ulcer upon the penis. These conditions are often indications for Hepar, when the constitutional state is present.
Hepar has also sycotic warts. It is useful in old cases of gleet; also when there is a sensation of a splinter in the urethra. In strictures and constrictions of inflammatory character during the inflammation there is a tendency to ulcerate, and with this the sensation of a stick is felt.
Arg. nit., Nit. ac. and Hepar run close together for this kind of inflammation, and will cure the inflammatory stricture before it becomes a complete and permanent fibrinous stricture.
It is only very rarely that you will be able with your medicines to cure a stricture after it has taken on permanency, after it is many years old, but as long as the inflammation keeps up there is hope.
I remember one very old one that was cured by Sepia. I did not know at first of its presence, but prescribed Sepia on the symptoms of the case, and the patient came back with great suffering in the urethra, and then confessed to me that he had had gonorrhoea and had been troubled for years with a stricture. That inflammation was aroused anew and after it ran its course it really left the passage clear and there was never any more trouble with the stricture.
That was a very unusual result. I have many times prescribed for patients with the utmost endeavors to do the same thing, and have cured the patient in other respects, but the stricture would remain. Remember then that Hepar has fig warts, chronic sycotic discharges, or chronic gonorrhoea, offensive, cheesy discharges, the sensation of sticks in the urethra, inflammatory stricture, which will be associated with difficulty in passing urine, to the extent that there is a weakness of the bladder and the urine falls perpendicularly.
Suppuration: Hepar has served a valuable purpose in its ability to establish suppuration around foreign bodies. For instance, a foreign body is under the skin or is somewhere unknown. Perhaps it is the tip end of a projectile after the projectile itself has been taken away, or under the nail a splinter is forming a suppuration. It is so small that it is hardly observed and it is supposed often that the splinter has been entirely removed, but an inflammatory condition starts up.
Hepar if indicated by the general symptoms of the patient hastens the suppuration and heals up the finger, for it has all such things. Silica is another remedy capable of establishing inflammation and suppuration and removes little foreign bodies that cannot be located.
Of course it is understood that if the physician knows the location of a splinter, he will take such steps as are necessary to remove it, and not wait for the action of a remedy. But at times a needle point breaks off against the bone of the finger of a seamstress, or small portions of the needle may exist where they cannot be found without an immense amount of slashing which the patient refuses. Hepar or Silica will remove it. A little abscess will form and the little mite will be discharged.
Knowing that these two remedies have this tendency to establish a suppuration wherever there are foreign bodies, it is well to be reminded that if a bullet were encysted in the lungs it would be well, if the symptoms called for Hepar or Silica, to consider whether it might not be injurious to give a remedy that would
establish a suppuration. It might be that the bullet is resting in a vital place, in a net-work of arteries, and it would be well not to establish suppuration in this vital region.
Deposits, of a tubercular character are often located in a place that they can easily be suppurated out, and the action of the remedy on them would be the same as a foreign body. Hence it is that Hepar, after its administration, will very often abolish a crop of boils all over the economy because in the skin there are small accumulations of sebaceous matter and these will be suppurated out.
Sulphur also does this, so that it may be well to be careful and not give Silica or Sulphur, or Hepar too often, or too high, in patients that have encysted tubercle in the lungs. Rokitansky in his numerous post-mortems found a large number of encysted caseous deposits in the lungs, in cases that had lived and outgrown these trouble; they had become encysted and therefore perfectly safe and the patient had died of something else.
It might be dangerous to administer these medicines that have a tendency to cause suppuration in such, and you should at least proceed cautiously in using them. After you have seen a great many cases you will find that you have killed some of them. If our medicines were not powerful enough to kill folks, they would not be powerful enough to cure sick folks. It is well for you to realize that you are dealing with razors when dealing with high potencies.
I would rather be in a room with a dozen negroes slashing with razors than in the hands of ail ignorant prescriber of high potencies. They are means of tremendous harm, as well as of tremendous good.
In contrast with Hepar (although Hepar is a form of Calcarea), Calc. carb. has no such tearing down nature in it. It does not establish inflammation around foreign bodies and tend to suppurate them but causes a fibrous deposit around bullets and other foreign, substances in the flesh. It causes tubercular deposits to harden and contract and become encysted.
Many excellent homoeopathic physicians have said to me,
"I do not agree with you as to the danger of Sulphur in phthisical cases. I have cured cases of phthisis with Sulphur."
So have I many of them. But I did not refer to curable cases, but to those cases which are well developed and have gave symptoms. It is well to know all the elements in the case; then if you have administered a remedy and killed your patient, you know at least what you have done.
It is better to know what you have done if you have killed your patient, than to be ignorant of it and go on and kill some more in the same way.
Hydrastis Canadensis
Hydrastis is a slow, deep acting remedy, required in many trophic disturbances. where there is emaciation, catarrhal conditions and ulceration, even malignant ulceration. Defective assimilation.
When it is noticed that the stomach is the center of most of the symptom complex. The desires and aversions often give the key to a very complex totality of symptoms. In this remedy the sinking empty hunger with loathing of food is striking, strange, rare, and therefore Peculiar. It is characteristic because it is a general of the remedy, and is predicated of the patient. Great weakness prevails at all times.
Catarrhal symptoms with thick, viscid, ropy, yellow mucus, sometimes white, from any mucous membrane, with or without ulceration. Deep eating spreading ulcers upon the skin or mucous membrane, with thick, viscid, yellow pus. Induration in glands, in base of ulcers. False granulations that bleed much and easily, on the slightest touch.
This remedy has been very useful in the treatment of malignant ulcers. In such ulcers it is often a great comfort to the patient, even when it does not cure, as it removes the offensiveness, modifies the pain and restrains the destructiveness.
The burning so commonly found in such ulcers is a strong symptom of Hydrastis. When the weakness and emaciation have progressed together for months and years in chronic stomach disease, fainting comes on, and this is also found in Hydrastis. In chronic cases, when the tissues have suffered and not the mind.
The astonishing absence of mental symptoms except the general discouragement incidental to long suffering and weakness is striking. If it were carefully proved, most likely the mental loves and hates would come out. The symptoms are better during rest. Small wounds bleed and suppurate.
The headaches are only such as generally belong to stomach disorders, and prolonged nasal catarrh. They are not distinctive. It has cured eczema with thick crusts.
The eyes and face jaundiced. Ulceration of the cornea. Thick, yellow, viscid, mucous discharge. Chronic inflammation of lids. Inflammation, thickening, redness of margins of lids.
Otorrhoea with thick, viscid, purulent discharge. Copious mucous discharge. Catarrh of the Eustachian tubes with many noises in ears. Ears red, swollen, covered with scales; fissured behind where connected with head.
The nose is obstructed with stringy, yellow or white mucus. The air feels cold in the nose, and the membrane is raw and ulcerated. Ropy mucus is drawn from posterior nares into the throat. Rawness in both nares with constant urging to blow the nose. Coryza with discharge, scanty in room and profuse in open air. Bloody, purulent discharge from nose. Thick, white, or yellow mucous discharge. Large crusts constantly form in the nose.
The face is sickly, shrunken, pale, waxy, cachectic, jaundiced. It is of great service in epithelioma of face, nose or lip.
The tongue is yellow, large, flabby and spongy. Feels as if burnt. Ulceration of mouth, gums, tongue; spreading and burning. Aphthae in children and nursing mothers. Excessive secretions of ropy mucus; golden yellow. Excoriation of mouth. In old mercurial cases.
Catarrhal sore throat of long standing, granulated and ulcerated excoriated and burning. Thick, viscid, yellow mucus that can be drawn out in ropes.
No appetite; no thirst; loathing of food. Nearly all foods disorder the stomach. Spitting up the food by the mouthful (like Phos. and Ferr.). Vomits all food. Retains only water and milk. Eructations, sour, putrid, of food eaten.
Empty, faint feeling in stomach with loathing of food and obstinate constipation with no desire for stool, is a combination that must generally have Hydrastis. Pulsation in the stomach. Ulceration of the stomach with burning. For suspicious lump in region of pylorus. Weight in stomach after eating. The stomach seems to be only an ordinary sack; digestion is slow, and tedious. Fullness after eating, lasting a long time. The
empty, sinking feeling is not ameliorated after eating. Sour vomiting. Chronic gastric catarrh. Slow digestion.
This must be a useful liver remedy, for the following reasons: The skin is jaundiced; the stool is light, even white, showing the absence of bile, and there is distress in the region of the liver. In chronic derangement of the liver. Liver enlarged, hard and nodular.
Cramping pains. Colic, Flatulence and distended abdomen. It has cured many of the usual conditions that generally attend bad digestion and torpid liver. Intestinal catarrh and ulceration. Sharp pain in region of spleen.
It has cured obstinate piles, ulceration and fissures of anus. Relaxation and prolapsus of anus. Chronic diarrhoea with yellow, thin faeces, even watery. Inflammation of anus. Stools, bileless, white, soft, acrid, greenish, much viscid mucus. Hard, nodular stools. Most obstinate constipation; no desire for stool for days.
Paresis of the rectum. It cures constipation, when the stomach symptoms agree. In old cases when enemas no longer act, when the faeces remain high up, or do not come down into rectum to excite desire, this remedy has been of great service. In constipation or diarrhoea with "goneness" in stomach, trembling in the abdomen and palpitation.
Urine scanty or suppressed. Chronic catarrh of bladder with much viscid mucus in urine, causing difficulty in flow of urine.
Catarrh of the urethra. Chronic gonorrhoea when the discharge remains yellow in spite of time. Copious, painless discharge. Relaxed scrotum and testes. Offensive sweat of genitals.
Thick, yellow, viscid leucorrhoea, sometimes white, sometimes offensive. Excoriation of vagina. Soreness in vagina during coition. Bleeding after coition. Uterine haemorrhage. Menses copious. Relaxed, dragging feeling in pelvis. Intense itching of vulva. Epithelioma of mamma.
Most obstinate catarrh of larynx, trachea and bronchial tubes, with copious, thick, ropy mucus and ulceration. Rawness in air passages. Catarrh of chest in old people.
The cough, is dry, hard; from tickling in larynx. Rawness in chest. Rattling cough. Thick, yellow, viscid, sometimes white, expectoration in old people, or when very chronic.
Palpitation from slowly progressing weakness. Weakness and stiffness in back in lumbar region, must walk about before he can straighten up the back. Must use the arms to rise from a seat.
Rheumatic pains in upper limbs. Weakness and rheumatic pains in lower limbs. Ulcers on legs and about ankles, with stinging, burning pains; high, hard edges; painful at night in warm bed; sensitive to touch. Oedema of feet.
Warmth and washing aggravate ulcers and eruptions. The skin, excoriates easily. Urticaria over body, aggravated at night. Fissures about mouth and anus.
Ulceration. Bed sores. Lupus evedens.
Hyoscyamus
Nervous system: Hyoscyamus is hill of convulsions, contractions, trembling, quivering and jerkings of the muscles. Convulsions in vigorous people, coming on with great violence. Convulsions that involve the whole economy, with unconsciousness, coming on in the night. Convulsions in women at the menstrual period; and then the lesser convulsions of single muscles, and contractions of single muscles.
Little jerkings and twitchings. In low forms of the disease it takes on the latter, jerkings and twitchings of muscles. In low typhoid states where there is great prostration with twitching. He feels it himself if conscious, enough to realize it, but others see it. An evidence of great prostration of the nervous system. Sliding down in bed, twitching of the muscles.
All the muscles tremble and quiver, a constant state of erethism throughout the economy. A state of irritability and excitability. Convulsive jerks of the limbs, so that all sorts of angular motions are made, automatic motions. Choreic motions.
But angular motions of the arms, and picking at the bedclothes. Picking at something in delirium. Gradually increasing weakness, whether it be in a continued fever where there has been a delirium or excitement, or in a case of insanity with erethism, of the nerves and mind; excitability and gradually increasing weakness.
Complete prostration, so that the patient slides down in bed, until the jaw drops. So the intermingling of jerkings and quiverings and tremblings and weakness and convulsive action of muscles are all striking features. Infants go into convulsions.
"Falls suddenly to the ground with cries and convulsions. Convulsions of children, especially from fright. Convulsions after eating."
The child becomes sick after eating, vomits and goes into convulsions. "Shrieks and becomes insensible."
Goes into convulsions, such as the old books used to say, from worms; and the mother goes into convulsions soon after the child is born, called puerperal convulsions.
"Convulsions during sleep. Suffocating spells and convulsions during labor.
Toes become spasmodically cramped."
Mind: The mental state is really the greatest part of Hyoscyamus. Talking, passive delirium, imaginations, illusions, hallucinations; talking, rousing up and talking with a delirious manifestation, and then stupor. These alternate through complaints. And during sleep talking, crying out in sleep; but, talking and mumbling and soliloquizing. Then, there are wakeful periods, in which there are delirium and illusions and hallucinations all mingled together.
Sometimes the patient is in a state of hallucination, and the next minute in a state of illusion. Which means that a part of the time what he sees as hallucinations he believes to be so; and then these hallucinations become delusions.
Again, the things he sees he knows are not so, and then they are illusions. But he is full of hallucinations. He sees all sorts of things, indescribable things in his hallucinations. He imagines all sorts of things concerning people, concerning himself, and he gets suspicious. Suspicion runs through acute sickness; it runs through the mania in insanity. Suspicion that his wife is going to poison him; that his wife is untrue to him. Suspicious of everybody.
"Refuses to take medicine because it is poisoned."
"Imagines, that he is pursued, that the people have all turned against him, that his friends are no longer his friends.
He carries on conversations with imaginary people."
Talks as if he were talking to himself, but he really imagines that some one is sitting by his side, to whom he is talking.
Sometimes he talks to dead folks; recalls past events with those that have departed. Calls up, a dead sister, or wife, or husband, and, enters into conversation just as- if the per son were present.
Hyoscyamus has another freak in this peculiar mental state. Perhaps, there may be a queer kind of paper on the wall, and he lies and looks at it, and if he can possibly turn the figures into rows he will keep busy at that day and night, and lie wants a light there so he can put them into rows, and he goes to sleep and dreams about it, and wakes up and goes at it again; it is the same idea.
Sometimes, he will imagine the things are worms, are vermin, rats, cats, mice, and he is leading them like children lead around their toy wagons - just like a child. The mind is working in this; no two alike; perhaps you may never see these identical things described, but you will see something like it that the mind is reveling, in strange and ridiculous things.
One patient had a string of bedbugs going up a wall, and he had, them tied with a string, and was irritated because he could not make the last one keep up. Hyoscyamus did him a great deal of good. You do not find that expression in the text, but I will speak of it as analogous to the things that belong to the text. He is in alternate states. One minute he raves, and another he scolds in delirium, in excitement; the next he is in a stupor.
Stupor: Finally, in a typhoid state, after he has progressed some time, he passes into quite a profound stupor. Early in the case he can be roused, and he answers questions correctly, and he seems to know what you have said to him; but the instant he finishes the last, answer he appears to be sound asleep.
Then you shake him and ask him another question, he answers that, and again he is sound asleep. The delirium that belongs to typhoid grows more and more profound, more and more passive, more and more muttering, until he passes into a complete unconsciousness front which he cannot be roused; in which he will lie for days sometimes, and weeks, becoming more and more emaciated; lying there in profound stupor unless this remedy is administered.
Lying there picking the bedclothes, and muttering. Even when he is in a stupor and realizes nothing apparently, that is going on, he makes passive motions, mutters, talks to himself, and once in a while utters
a shrill scream. Picking his fingers, just as if he had something in his fingers when there is nothing there. He picks at the bedclothes the same way. Picking at his nightshirt, or picking anything he get his fingers on. Or, picking in the air, grasping as if he were grasping at flies.
This passive delirium goes on until he is in a profound stupor, and lies as one dead. In an insane state it sometimes takes on something of wildness, but not often. It is more passive, talking and prattling, sitting still in one corner and jabbering, or lying down, or going about.
"Undertaking to do the usual things, the usual duties."
That is, the housewife will want to get up and do the things she is used to doing in the house; the cooper will want to make barrels and the unusual things belonging to that business. Wants to carry on the usual occupation in his mind, talks about it, carries on the things of the day, and he keeps busy about it, so it is a busy insanity. Also, the delirium takes on the type of a busy delirium.
Now, to give you something of an idea as to the grading of this general type of insanity it should be compared with Stram. and Bell. You heard in the lecture on Bell. that it is violent, its fever most intense. There is much excitement. In Stram., when we reach that you will see that his delirium, his insanity, is expressed in terms of extreme violence.
These three run so close together that something can be brought out by associating them together. When considering Hyoscyamus in its mental state it is well to realize that it seldom has much fever in its insanity. It has a fever sometimes in the low form, but when Hyoscyamus is thought of in relation to a febrile state the intensity of the heat would be this order:
Bell., Stram., Hyoscyamus. Now, Bell. is very hot in its mental states. Stram., most violent and active, murderously violent, is moderately hot in its fever, as a rule. Hyoscyamus has a low fever, not very high, sometimes none at all, with its insanity. When one comes to take into consideration the violence of its delirium, or the maniacal actions, then it changes the order.
The order as to violence of conduct would be: Stram., Bell., Hyoscyamus. That brings you to see that even when associated with those medicines that look most like it, it is at the bottom of the list. It goes as a passive medicine, while the upper ones are more active. Hyoscyamus has a passive mania. Does not go into violence.
That is, the patient will sometimes become murderous, but it is more likely to be suicidal. Sometimes the patient will talk and prattle, sometimes sit and say nothing.
"Full of imaginations and hallucinations when asleep and when awake.
Religious turn of mind" with women who have been unusually pious; they take on the delusion that they have sinned away their day of grace. They have done some awful things.
"She imagines that she has murdered, that she has done some dreadful thing. She cannot apply the promises that she reads in the Word of God to herself." She will say:
"They do not mean me, they do not apply to me, they mean somebody else."
"Thinks he is in the wrong place.
Thinks he is not at home.
Sees persons who are not and who have not been present. Fears being left alone.
Fears poison or being bitten."
These phases sometimes take on fear in the sense of fear, but it comes from that suspicion that was spoken of; he suspicions or fears these things will take place. He imagines these things are to take place, and hence he is suspicious of all his friends.
Another thing running through the remedy, in insanity and in the delirium of fevers, is a fear of water, fear of running water. Of course, hydrophobia, which is named because of that symptom being a striking feature, has fear of water, but some remedies also have that fear of water.
"Anxiety on hearing running water. A fear of water."
That runs through Bell., Hyoscyamus, Canth., and, of course, the nosode Hydrophobinum. Stram. has the fear of water. Stram. has the fear of anything that might look like water, shining objects, fire looking-glass. Fear of things that have in any manner whatever the resemblance of fluids, and hence the sound of fluids. Hydrophobinum has cured
"involuntary urination on hearing running water. Involuntary discharge from the bowels on hearing running water."
It has cured a chronic diarrhea when that symptom was present. Hyoscyamus "makes short, abrupt answers to imaginary questions."
Imagines that somebody has asked a question, and he answers it; hence, you will find a patient with typhoid fever answering questions that you have not asked. He imagines that persons are in the room and asking him questions. You hear nothing but his answers; he is in delirium or insane.
"Mutters absurd things to himself. Cries out suddenly."
There is another form of his delirium, and there are two phases of this. He wants to go naked; wants to take the clothing off, and this must be analyzed. At first you might not understand that. Hyoscyamus has such sensitive nerves all over the body in the skin that he cannot bear the clothing to touch the skin, and he takes it off. That occurs in insanity and sometimes in delirium, and he has no idea that he is exposing his body. He appears to be perfectly shameless, but he has no thought of shamelessness, no thought that he is doing anything unusual, but he does it from the hyperesthesia of the skin.
There is another phase running through the insanity, which is salacity, and it is violent at times, so violent that nobody but the old doctor can form any conception of the awfulness of it, and the dreadfulness of its effects upon those in the room. With a woman, a wife or a daughter, this state of salacity is manifested in this way: she exposes her genitals to the view of everybody coming into the room. There are instances where in these violent attacks of salacity a woman has gathered her clothing up under her arms to expose her genitals to the doctor as he walked into the room.
"Violent sexual excitement and nymphomania. Obscene things.
Speech illustrated by urine, faeces and cow dung,” and all sorts of things come out in this state of insanity and delirium - and yet - this is only sickness.
"He is violent and beats people.
Strikes and bites.
Sings constantly and talks hastily.
Erotic mania, accompanied by jealousy.
Lascivious mania.
Sings amorous songs.
Lies in bed naked, or wrapped in a skin during summer heat."
Not because he is cold, but because of a fancy. Complaints involving any of these mental phases may come on in a young woman from disappointed affections, from coming to the conclusion that the young man in whom she has reposed her confidence has become wholly unworthy of her. It drives her insane, and she may take on any of these phases.
Eyes: Patients who have come out of continued fevers, convulsions, or insanity have paralytic condition of the eyes, of the muscles of the eyes.
"Disturbances of vision. Far-sightedness. Drawing tension in some of the muscles, and paralysis in others. Strabismus."
This is one of the most frequently indicated remedies. The strabismus that comes on from brain disease should be cured with a remedy.
In the Hyoscyamus fevers there is so much brain trouble, and there is left behind a tendency to muscular weakness of the eyes, disturbances of the eyes, and congestion of the retina, and disturbances of vision. Double sight.
"Obscuration of vision.
Night-blindness.
Distorted appearance of the eyes.
Spasmodic action of the internal recti."
"Pupils dilated and insensible to light."
Sometimes contracted, but in these low unconscious states of typhoid it is likely to be dilated. Then again, after he recovers from these low forms of disease there is quivering of the lids, and jerking of the lids,
jerking of the muscles of the eye, so that the eyeball is unsteady. It moves from little spasms of the various muscles of the globe of the eye.
All of these symptoms occur either along with the fever, or afterwards. The child goes into convulsions, or has periods of convulsions, where, during the course of a week or ten days, there have been from fifteen to fifty convulsions, and it may be the convulsions have been remedied with Bell. or Cuprum, or any one of a number of remedies, and afterwards these eye troubles, strabismus and disturbances of vision.
"An object looked at jumps." The letters jump while reading. Spasmodic complaints, periodical complaints, paroxysmal complaints of a
nervous character will run through the remedy in various regions, and especially in its coughs, its stomach troubles and abdominal conditions.
Mouth and tongue: The mouth brings forth a lot of symptoms. The mouth is very dry, "as dry as burnt leather."
The tongue tastes like sole leather. because of dryness. Sometimes the patient will say, "My tongue rattles in my mouth, it is so dry.”
Very great dryness of the mouth, throat and nose, wherever the mucous membranes are. Dry, cracked, red, will bleed in low forms of typhoid. About the second week, going into the third, the teeth are covered with black blood, lips cracked and bleeding.
"Tongue cracked and bleeding.
Patient unconscious, except by much shaking or repeated calling be is roused" and slowly puts out that trembling tongue, which is covered with blood, cracks, and is dry.
"Sordes on the teeth" in low forms of fever. "Twitching of the muscles of the face upon attempting to put out the tongue."
It trembles like it does in Lach., catches on to the teeth from its great dryness, and the jaw hangs down, relaxed, the mouth wide open.
The whole mouth is dry and offensive. Sometimes during fever the jaw becomes fixed as if it were locked, and it is with great difficulty that it can be moved.
"Closes the teeth tightly together.
Pulsating pains in the teeth.
Jerking, throbbing, tearing in the teeth.
Sordes on the teeth;” and in sleep in these low forms of fever he is grinding the teeth. Children, either in convulsions, or between convulsions, in congestion, also grind the teeth in the night, and in this comatose state. It says in the text,
"The tongue is red, brown, dry, cracked, hard.
Looks like burnt leather.
The tongue does not obey the will.
Difficult motion of the tongue; it is stiff, protruded with great difficulty.
Biting the tongue in talking."
The tongue becomes paralyzed.
"Loss of speech.
Utters inarticulate sounds.
Speech embarrassed.
Talks with difficulty."
The muscles of the throat, of the tongue, those that take part in swallowing, the muscles of the oesophagus, of the pharynx, become stiff and paralyzed so that swallowing is difficult.
"Food taken into the throat comes up into the nose." Fluids come out of the nose, or go down into the larynx.
"The sight of water, or the hearing of running water, or the attempt to swallow water produces spasmodic constriction of the oesophagus."
Stomach and abdominal symptoms: The next very important feature of this medicine is its stomach and abdominal symptoms. Vomiting. Dread of water. Unquenchable thirst. Aversion to water, as it were, from the stomach; a mental fear of water.
The stomach is distended. Great pain in the stomach. Dryness evidently in the stomach like there is in the mouth, because it occurs along with it. Burning and smarting in the stomach; and when there is no inflammation there is vomiting of blood. Stitching pains, colicky pains, distension. The distension of the whole abdomen.
"Abdomen wonderfully distended, almost to bursting."
Feels like a drum, tympanitic.
"Great soreness; can hardly touch the abdomen because of the soreness.
Cannot be handled, cannot be turned except with great difficulty, very slowly, and with caution. Cutting pains in the abdomen."
Inflammation of all the viscera of the abdomen in low typhoid state, with great distension. Petechia upon the abdomen, such as is found in a typhoid.
Then comes the diarrhoea, very much like that which is found in low forms of continued fever. "Bleeding from the bowels; ulceration of Peyer's glands," and the yellow, cornmeal mushy stool. In Hyoscyamus there is that mushy stool that occurs in typhoid fever, pappy consistency. Again, a watery, horribly offensive, bloody fluid. Most of the time the stools and the passages are painless.
"Painless discharges from the bowels.
Watery mucus, sometimes odorless, but commonly very offensive."
Then, another part of it is that the patient has no realization of the passage. It is involuntary. Both the urine and the stool are passed without his knowledge. Watery. bloody, or mushy. Hysterical females and young girls, who are subject to attacks of diarrhoea and bloody stools. Relaxed state of the bowels connected with relaxation of the uterus.
"Diarrhoea during pregnancy. Diarrhoea during typhoid fever. Paralysis of the sphincter ani.
Paralysis of the bladder after labor, so that the urine remains in the bladder, with no desire to urinate."
Bladder: The routine remedy for retention of urine after labor is Caust. Caust., like Rhus, is a great remedy for the effect of strain upon muscles and parts, and the violent effort that a woman passes through in expelling the child in many instances leaves all the pelvic muscles tired, relaxed, paralyzed.
Then comes that which was mentioned, which really belongs to the general state more than the local; violent sexual desire. Violent sexual desire in girls who never had that desire. Coming on and manifesting itself only during the inflammation of the brain.
"Labour-like pains from taking cold."
A cold settles in the uterus, bringing on painful menstruation. Hyoscyamus has various crampings; cramps in the fingers and toes and of the muscles here and there, temporary paralysis, etc. It has suppressed menstruation. There are many conditions belonging to menstruation, pregnancy and parturition that are hysterical in character.
Twitchings, cough, constipation, diarrhea, etc., that belong to a hysterical nature.
"Puerperal convulsions.
Jerks violently at the oncoming of the convulsions.
After miscarriage, haemorrhage of bright red blood, No desire of the bladder to expel the contents." Voice: And then comes the voice, the larynx, respiration, and cough.
Constriction of the larynx. Much mucus in the larynx and air passages, makes the speech and voice rough. Hoarseness with dry and inflamed throat. Speech difficult. Hysterical aphonia. Hyoscyamus and Veratrum are two medicines that cure and make a nervous hysterical woman a great deal more sensible.
"Difficult spasmodic respiration from spasm of the chest. Apparently loss of breath; rattling in the chest."
Hysterical cough. Sensitive, hysterical girls, or sensitive women, with spinal irritation, have paroxysmal cough, coming on periodically, coming on from excitement. When this patient lies down in the daytime, at night, any time, on will come the spasmodic cough with contractions in the larynx, spasms in the larynx, choking, gagging, and vomiting.
"Redness of the face, and suffocation." It is a dry, hacking, choking cough, that racks the whole body, in spinal affections. "Tickling in the larynx.
Dry, hacking, and spasmodic cough, worse lying, better sitting, worse at night, after eating, drinking, talking and singing.
Dry, spasmodic, persistent cough."
But its characteristic cough is a dry, racking, harassing cough, worse lying down. Those young women and girls with sore spots on the spine from the coccyx to the brain, sore places that manifest themselves when leaning back against a chair.
These take a little cold in the larynx, and sometimes it is purely from a nervous attack. Sometimes spinal irritation, spinal cough in those that have curvature of the spine.
"During cough, spasms in the larynx. Cough worse after midnight; wakes the patient from sleep. Cough in cold air, and from eating and drinking.
Cough after measles.
Violent spasmodic cough."
The cough is most exhausting. A cough will sometimes last until the patient is covered with sweat and is exhausted, and leans forward to get a little relief; and he coughs until he is exhausted.
"Spasms of the muscles of the chest. Contraction of the muscles of one side of the neck. Spinal meningitis with convulsions."
Paralytic weakness of the limbs. Convulsions of the muscles. Twitching. Frequent twitchings of the muscles of the hands and feet.
Sleep: Many complaints come on during sleep.
The sleep is a great tribulation to this nervous patient. There are times of sleeplessness. Again, profound sleep.
"Sleepless, or constant sleep."
Either awake or asleep, there may be muttering,
"Long continued sleeplessness.
Lascivious dreams.
Lying on the back he suddenly sits up and then lies down again."
That means that the patient wakes out of sleep, looks all around, wonders what terrible thing he has been dreaming about; his dreams seen real. He looks all about and sees nothing of the objects of his dream, he lies down and goes to sleep again.
He keeps doing that all night. Starts up in a fright. jerks in sleep, and cries out. Grates the teeth. Laughing during sleep. With so much brain trouble as belongs to this medicine, we would expect the dreams and the fright, the disturbances, the twitching and trembling in sleep. Its fevers are low forms of fever, the continued fever, the typhoid.
Hypericum
One who makes a study of the proving of Hypericum will be reminded of a class of injuries involving sentient nerves and it is not surprising that this remedy has come into use for the results of such injuries.
Injuries: The surgery of Homeopathy largely involves the use of Arnica, Rhus tox., Ledum, Staphysagria, Calcarea and Hypericum. These remedies are used in a routine way when a physician runs into semi- surgical conditions, or the results of injuries.
For the bruised, "black-and-blue," sore appearance and sensation Arnica comes into use it corresponds especially to the acute stage until the soreness and bruised condition have disappeared from the parts injured or from the whole body; but for the strains of muscles and tendons Arnica proves insufficient and a thorough study of Rhus will show that that remedy is suitable for the resultant weakness of tendons and muscles, and the bruised, rheumatic feelings that come on in every storm and often wear off on continued motion.
For the final weakness that persists even after Rhus we have Calcarea carb. In these three remedies we have a series, but to distinguish these from Hypericum is the important thing. Hypericum is only a minor remedy for bruised and strained tendons and muscles; it goes into a different class of complaints.
Hypericum and Ledum run close together, and they have to be compared. Ledum, as much of the sore bruised feeling of Arnica and will often take its place; but Hypericum and Ledum come together for consideration when an injury to a nerve has taken on inflammatory action. Instead of the muscles and bones and blood vessels, as in Arnica, Rhus and Calcarea, the nerves are the sphere for these two remedies.
Nerves injuries: When the finger ends or toes have beer, bruised or lacerated, or a nail has been torn off, or when a nerve has become pinched between a hammer and the bone in a blow, and that nerve becomes inflamed and the pain can be traced up along the nerve, and it is gradually extending toward the body from the injured part with stitching, darting pains, coming and going, or shooting up from the region of the injury toward the body, a dangerous condition is coming on.
In this condition Hypericum is above all the remedies to be thought of and hardly any other medicine is likely to come in. It hardly need be said that lock-jaw is threatening.
Sometimes a vicious dog will take bold of an individual through the thumb, or through the hand or the. wrist and run one of his great teeth through the radial nerve or some of its branches in the hand, causing a lacerated wound. You may not find in the earlier stages the symptoms of Hypericum, but they will develop gradually and you will have them to treat. Do not cut the off, but cure it. We cure all these injuries with medicines-punctured, incised, contused and lacerated wounds, painful wounds.
A wound will sometimes yawn, swell up, no tendency to heal, look dry and shiny on its edges, red; inflamed; burning, stinging, tearing pains; no healing process. That wound needs Hypericum. It prevents tetanus. Every practitioner knows that lock-jaw way develop after an injury to sentient nerves. The old school doctor is frightened by these shooting pains up the arms after an injury. A shoemaker may stick his awl into the end of his thumb or a carpenter may stick his finger with a brass tack and he does not think much of it, but the next night shooting pains extend up the arm with much violence.
The allopathic physician looks upon that as a series matter, for he sees lockjaw or tetanus ahead. When these pains come on Hypericum will stop them, and from this stage to advanced states of tetanus with opisthotonos and lock-jaw Hypericum is the remedy. It is full of just such symptoms as are found in tetanus and such symptoms as lead to tetanus and it is full of all the manifestations of an ascending neuritis.
Again, you may have an old scar, and it comes in contact with a hard body and is injured, bruised, torn internal) smashed, and stinging, tearing pains come in that cicatrix, and it burns and stings, and there is no relief, and the pain runs toward the body along the course of nerves. A painful cicatrix with pain shooting up toward the centre of the body following up the nerves.
Hypericum is the medicine for that.
Now there are other remedies - all know about Arnica, but be sure you keep it in its place. The first stage of the injury, where much bruising has been done, and there are none of these pains that I have described, for the first hours for bruised conditions and concussions and shocks Arnica is routine, because it produces states upon the human body like it had been bruised. But you will find Arnica only fits into that one place.
Arnica should never be used for wounds the way the lay people use it, because if it is used in full strength it may bring on erysipelas.
Again, for bruised of bone, cartilages, tendons, insertion of tendons, bruises about cartilages and about joints, Ruta is better than any other remedy; and if we study the proving of Ruta we will not be surprised, because it produces symptoms like those found in such conditions.
Lingering, sore, bruised places on bones, in joints and upon cartilages. But Ledum comes in very often as a preventive Medicine. It is a preventive medicine when an accident happen to the ends of the fingers, if a patient steps on a nail or tack or sticks a splinter under a finger-nail or into the foot. Ifa horse pick up a nail, pull it out and give him a dose of Ledum; there will never be trouble, he will, not have lock-jaw.
These punctured wounds, rat bites, cat bites, etc-, are all made safe by Ledum; i.e., Ledum prevents the shooting pains that naturally come and the nerves will never be involved. We will have no trouble if we can give it at once. Again, if the pain is a dull aching in the part that was injured, in the wound Ledum is still the remedy; if it shoots from the wound up the nerve of the arm it is more like Hypericum.
A sensitive nervous women steps on a tack during the day, and she feels all the day where the tack went in, lies down in bed and it aches so violently she cannot keep it still. Ledum will prevent any further trouble, but if that goes on until the morning the pains will be shooting up the leg, calling for Hypericum.
I mentioned the use of Ledum when a horse picks up a nail. Now, if a nail goes through the thin part of the hoof and strikes the coffin bone that horse is almost sure to die with tetanus; the veterinarians know nothing for it; though they paultice it and put on liniments, etc., that horse will die with tetanus; but if a dose of Ledum is given before the tetanus comes on it will save the animal from tetanus; after the jerking comes on it will save the animal from tetanus; after the jerking comes on Ledum will not do, but Hypericum must be given.
Hypericum belongs to lacerated wounds and when there is laceration of parts that are full of small nerves, sentient nerves, give it at once. Do not waste time with Arnica because there is soreness, for the soreness is of much less importance than the danger from nerves in lacerated wounds. In punctured wounds give Ledum at once. Whatever sequences come on, of course, have to be met in accordance with the, state and symptoms of the case.
Spine injuries: Injuries of the spine give us another class of troubles requiring Hypericum.
I remember a case such as has been met with quite often and such as we read of and hear about, one, however, that was not saved. A sudden lurch of the car caused a man who was standing on the rear end of the car to be hurled back on his coccyx. He did not think much of it, went home, bad pains in the head and various pass of the body.
Several physicians were called; nobody could find out what was the matter with him, and at the end of ten days he died. They turned him over and found that his coccyx was black and an abscess was threatening in the muscular region. If it had been known Hypericum would have saved his life.
Many times I have seen Hypericum cure similar conditions. Injuries of the coccyx are among the most serious and troublesome injuries that the physician comes in contact with; injuries just like that, falling back and striking a stone, or something that bruises the coccyx.
Very little is found immediately in the coccyx; close examination reveals nothing more than soreness upon pressure, but many times we do have the description of pains shooting up the spine and down the extremities, shooting pains over the body and often convulsive movements.
When such symptoms are present any physician ought to be wise enough to find out an injury, but even very astute physicians are blinded over injuries of the coccyx. Many a woman sustains an injury of the coccyx during labor, and however, slight, soreness remains for years afterwards, and she is always in trouble, always hysterical and nervous, from this injury of the coccyx.
Such injuries, if taken early, can be cured by Hypericum. It is in the remedy. Slight inflammation or irritation of the lower part of the cord; it feels lacerated, and sore, and aches and never passes over until the results of the injury right in the spot have been removed. These injuries have been cured in after years by Carbo animalis, Silica and Thuja and other remedies as indicated.
It is related also to injuries of the spine higher up. It is not an uncommon thing for a man. while going down stairs, to fall backward, his feet to slip from under him and he strikes his back upon one of the steps and undergoes a sharp injury.
Some will at once give Rhus tox; I have known others to give Arnica. Hypericum is to be given at once to prevent the kind of inflammation that may come from such an injury. Then there will be other tendencies, such as drawings and rheumatic symptoms, that will come on, calling for Rhus and finally Calcarea.
Old weakness of the back, with painfulness on rising from a seat, are often cured by Rhus, followed by Calcarea, but Hypericum must first of all take care of the condition of the fibres of the cord and meninges. Meningeal troubles are common from injuries of that class, with drawing of the muscles of the back, a feeling of contraction or tightening. Stitching, shooting pains in the back in various directions; they shoot down the limbs. Injuries of the back are not so likely to end in tetanus as the injuries of the sensory nerves; but they are sometimes even more troublesome because they linger so long.
Persons who have been injured in the spine or about the coccyx linger along for years with symptoms that would lead to many remedies. We find in the provings such symptoms as occur after these injuries, and, of course, this remedy will cure anything that its proving justifies. Its action is upon the nerve sheaths and meninges, with stitching, tearing, rending pains along the nerves, wherever there are injuries.
Now, there is another remedy that we want to know. If you have a clear-cut or incised wound made with a sharp instrument, or if you have made such an opening with your knife while practicing surgery, if you have opened the abdominal cavity and the walls of the abdomen take on an unhealthy look, and there are stinging, burning pains, Staphysagria is the remedy that will make granulation come immediately.
Sphincters: Staphysagria is also a wonderfully useful remedy where the sphincter stretchers have been.
Staphysagria is the natural antidote to stretching. When the urethra of a woman has been stretched for stone in the bladder, Staphysagria is useful. | remember a case of stretching of the urethra; after the operation the patient was in great distress, screaming and crying, bathed in a cold, sweat. head hot and body in cold sweat.
Staphysagria was given to him and in a few minutes she went to sleep. She had been six hours in that suffering without any relief whatever. Where coldness, congestion of the head, and rending, tearing pains occur from stretching sphincters, or from tearing parts, for the purpose of operation, death is likely to occur, and Staphysagria is closely related to that tearing, lacerating and stretching of fibres which causes such suffering.
After a surgical operation, where there has been much cutting, a great state of prostration, coldness, oozing of blood, almost cold breath, of course the Materia Medica man, if there is one around, will say,
"Why give him Carbo veg., of course."
Yes, you will, but it will not help him. It may disappoint you. But if you are a surgeon, know your surgical therapeutics better than a Materia Medica man, you will say,
"No, Strontium carb. is what I want."
It relieves that congestion all over the body; he gets warm and has a comfortable night. Strontium carb. is the Carbo veg. of the surgeon.
Lastly, we sometimes have to antidote chloroform, and because there are pains and aches you will get no action from these medicines; you can antidote your chloroform almost instantly by a dose of Phosphorus, because it is the natural antidote of chloroform. Phosphorus will stop the vomiting, Phosphorus has vomiting like that of chloroform. Phosphorus likes cold things, cold water in the stomach, and vomits as soon as water has become warm in the stomach. So does chloroform. Why should they not antidote each other?
Ignatia
Ignatia is frequently required and is especially suited to sensitive, delicate women and children; to hysterical women. You will not cure the natural hysterics with Ignatia, but you will cure those gentle, sensitive, fine fibred, refined, highly educated, overwrought women in their nervous complaints with Ignatia when they take on complaints that are similar to such symptoms as come in hysteria.
Hysterical diathesis: The hysterical diathesis is one that is very singular and difficult to comprehend.
But a woman, when overwrought and overexcited and emotional, will do things that she herself cannot account for. She will do things as if she were crazy in her excitement. Will do things she regrets, while the hysteric is always glad of it. No matter how much foolishness there is in it she has only made an exhibition that she is proud of. But our efforts go out for those who imitate them unconsciously. Those who will to do well.
A woman has undergone a controversy at home. She has been disturbed, is excited, and goes into cramps, trembles and quivers. Goes to bed with a headache. Is sick. Ignatia will be her remedy. When she has great distress; unrequited affections. A sensitive, nervous young girl finds out that she has misplaced her affections; the young man has disappointed her; she has a weeping spell, headache, trembles, is nervous, sleepless; Ignatia will make her philosophical and sensible.
A woman loses her child, or her husband. A sensitive, delicate woman, and she suffers from this grief. She has headaches, trembles, is excited, weeps, is sleepless; unable to control herself. In spite of her best endeavors, her grief has simply torn her to pieces. She is unable to control her emotions and her excitement.
Ignatia will quiet her and tide her over the present moment. In all of these instances where all of these conditions brought on from such troubles keep coming back, where your patient dwells upon them, dwells upon the cause, and the state keeps recurring, Natrum mur. will finish up the case.
It will nerve her up and help her to bear her sufferings. Especially useful in constitutions that have been over wrought at school, in science, music, art. Of course, it is natural for very sensitive girls to go into the arts, such as music, painting, etc.
A daughter comes back from Paris after a number of years close application to her music. She is unable to do anything. She flies all to pieces. Every noise disturbs her. She cannot sleep nights. Excitable, sleepless, trembles, jerks, cramps in the muscles; weeps from excitement, and from every disturbing word. Ignatia will tone her up wonderfully.
Sometimes it will complete the whole case. But especially in these oversensitive girls is Natrum mur. very commonly the chronic. It is the natural chronic of Ignatia. When the troubles keep coming back, and Ignatia comes to a place when it will not hold any longer.
Another place where Ignatia and Natrum mur. run close together. A sensitive, overtired girl, after she has been working in music, and in art, and in school, and has tired herself out, is unable to control her affections. Her affections rest on some one whom she would despise. That may be a singular thing, one may not be able to understand it.
A sensitive girl, though she would not let anyone but her mother know of it, falls in love with a married man. She lies awake nights, sobs. She says,
"Mother, why do I do that, I cannot keep that man out of my mind." At other times a man entirely out of her station, that she is too sensible to have anything to do with, she just thinks about him. Ignatia, if it is very recent, will balance up that girl's, mind. If not, Natrum mur.
comes in as a follower. We do not know half as much about the human mind as we think we do. We only know its manifestations.
These little things belong to this sphere of the action of this medicine. The one who knows the Materia Medica applies it in its breadth and its length, and sees in it that which is similar.
Ignatia has quivering in the limbs. Nervous, tremulous excitement. "Weakness of the body coming on suddenly.
Hysterical debility and fainting fits.
Fainting in a crowd."
It is especially useful in the tearful, nervous, sad, yielding, sensitive minds. "Jerking and twitching.
Convulsive twitchings."
Children are convulsed in sleep after punishment.
"Convulsions in children in the first period of dentition.
Spasms in children from fright."
The child is cold and pale, and has a fixed staring look, like Cina. "Convulsions with loss of consciousness.
Violent convulsions.
Tetanic convulsions.
Tetanus after fright.
Emotional chorea.
After fright, or grief."
Choreic girls. Emotional epilepsy, or epileptiform manifestations. Paralytic weakness.
"Great mental emotion."
Nursing; night watching. A loss of one arm with as perfect paralysis as if it had come from a cerebral haemorrhage. In a few hours this passes off, and the arm is as well as ever. That is a hysterical paralysis.
"Numbness of one or the other arm. Tingling and prickling in the arm."
Ignatia is full of surprises. If you are well acquainted with sickness, well acquainted with pathological conditions and that manifestations, you are then able to say whether you should or should not be surprised. You are then able to say what is natural, what is common to sickness. In Ignatia you find what is unnatural, and what is unexpected.
You see an inflamed joint, or an inflamed part where there is heat, redness, throbbing, and weakness; you will handle it with great care for fear it will be painful. Ordinarily you have a perfect right to expect it would
be painful. But you find it is not painful, and sometimes ameliorated by hard pressure. Is not that a surprise?
You look into the throat. It is tumid, inflamed, red; the patient complains of a sore throat and pain. Naturally you will not touch it with your tongue depressor for fear it will hurt.
You have every reason to suppose that the swallowing of solids will be painful. But you ask the patient when the pain is present, and the patient will say:
"When I am not swallowing anything solid."
The pain is ameliorated by swallowing anything solid, by the pressure. It pains all other times. Mentally, the patient does the most unaccountable and most unexpected things. Seems to have no rule to work by, no philosophy, no soundness of mind, and no judgment. The opposite of what would be expected, then, will be found.
The patient is better lying on the painful side. Instead of increasing the pain, it relieves the pain.
"Pain like a nail sticking into the side of the head."
The only comfort that is felt is by lying upon it, or pressing upon it, and that makes it go away. Stomach: The stomach is just as strange in its indigestion. Some day or other you will have a queer patient, vomiting everything taken into the stomach, and you will have her try gentle food, a little toast,
and the simplest possible things, because she has been vomiting for days and people begin to worry about it for fear she will starve to death.
You try this, and you try that, and she can keep nothing down. Finally she says, "It I could only have some cole slaw and some chopped onions, | think I could get along all right."
It is a hysterical stomach, and the patient eats some raw cabbage and some chopped onions, and from that time on she is well.
Those strange things that are ordinarily hard to digest ameliorate the nausea rather than increase it. While milk and toast, and delicate things, and warm things, such as are usually taken, disturb the stomach and
increase the nausea. Cold food is craved, and cold food will be digested when warm food will be disturbing and create indigestion.
Cough: The cough has similar features in it. An irritation will come in the throat, as a rule, that is why people cough.
People cough from smarting in the larynx and trachea, from irritation, from tickling, and from a sensation of fullness or a desire to expel something, and this is better by coughing.
But when the irritation in the larynx and trachea comes in the Ignatia patient you have the unexpected again; because the more she coughs the more the irritation to cough is observed, until the irritation is so great and the cough is so great that she goes into spasms. It has been known of an Ignatia patient, that the more she coughed the greater the irritation to cough, and she was drenched with sweat, sitting up in bed with her night-clothes drenched, gagging and coughing and retching, covered with sweat and exhausted.
When you are called to the bedside of such a patient, don't wait. You cannot get her to stop coughing long enough to say anything to you about it, only you will see the cough has grown more violent; Ignatia stops it at once. Without any provocation whatever a spasmodic condition will come on in the larynx.
Any little disturbance, a mental disturbance, a fright, or distress, or a grievance, will bring a young, sensitive woman home and to her bed, and she will go on with a spasm of the larynx. It is a laryngismus stridulus that can be heard all over the house. Ignatia stops it at once (Gelsemium, Moschus).
Mind: Nervous affections and troubles of all sorts come on at the menstrual period. The mind is always in a hurry, in a state of excitement.
No one can do things rapidly enough. The memory is untrustworthy. The mind flies all to pieces. It is a sort of confusion. No longer able to classify the things that have been classically put into the mind. Cannot remember her music, and her rules, and her scholastic methods. They have all vanished, and she is in a state of confusion. She is a worn-out, nervous person.
Then come fancies, vivid fancies, that are like delirium. Without fever, without chill. just after excitement. She comes home from some great disturbance of her emotions, and goes into a state that, if looked upon, per se, would appear to be a delirium such as appears in a fever. But upon close examination it is not a delirium. It is a momentarily hysterical excitement of the mind, in which the balance is lost, and she talks about everything.
Sees every manner of thing; it is a hysterical insanity, because after she rests or the next morning it has vanished. But these spells come oftener and oftener after they have once begun, and she gives way to them easier and easier, and, if they are not remedied, she becomes a lunatic, a confirmed mental wreck, so that excitement, grief, insanity, all intermingle together as cause and effect. These come first at the menstrual period, and then they come at other times, until they come from every little disturbance. Whenever she is crossed or contradicted.
"She desires to be alone and to dwell on the inconsistencies that come into her life. Sits and sobs.
At times she is taciturn; again, she prattles and is loquacious, and talks to herself."
She comes into a state in a little while where she delights to bring on her fits and to make a scare. The natural hysteric is born with that, and Ignatia will do her no good. But when this is brought on from conditions described, Ignatia is of the greatest benefit. It runs closely along by the side of Hyoscyamus.
"A feeling of continuous fright, or apprehensiveness that something is going to happen."
With all these mental states she has a feeling of emptiness in the stomach and abdomen. Emptiness and trembling.
"Melancholy after disappointed love, with spinal symptoms,”
"Great grief after losing persons or objects very near.
Trembling of the hands disturbs her very much in writing.
Dread of every trifle."
She goes into a state where she is utterly unable to undertake anything, even to write a letter to a friend. The Ignatia patient is not one that has been a simpleton, or of a sluggish mind or idiotic, but one that has become tired, and brought into such a state from over-doing and from over-excitement. From going too much. If rather feeble in body, from too much social excitement. Our present social state is will calculated
to develop a hysterical mind. The typical social mind is one that is always in a state of confusion. Asks questions, not waiting for the answer.
A good many remedies have this state; a lack of concentration of mind, that is what it is, but this is a peculiar kind of lack of concentration of mind. Dread, fear, anxiety, weeping, run through the remedy.
"Sensitive disposition; hyperacute."
Overwrought intense. Ignatia has another thing:
"Thinks she has neglected some duty."
That is very much like Puls., Hell. and Hyos., only Aurum believes that she has committed a great wrong. "Thinks that she has neglected some duty."
Dwells upon that much.
"Melancholy after great grief."
It is full of headaches, and they are all congestive, pressing headaches, or tearing headaches, or headaches as if a nail were sticking into the side of the head or temple; ameliorated from lying upon it. The headaches are all ameliorated by heat. The patient generally is ameliorated by warmth and aggravated by cold. Wants
cold things in the stomach, but warm things externally. Jerking headaches, throbbing headaches, congestive headaches.
Headaches in nervous and sensitive temperaments. Those whose nervous system has given way to anxiety, grief or mental work.
"Headaches from abuse of coffee, from smoking, from inhaling smoke, from tobacco or alcohol." Headache from close attention.
"Headache ameliorated, by warmth and rest; worse, from cold winds and turning the head suddenly; worse when pressing at stool, or from jar, from hurrying, from excitement."
Looking up increases the pain; moving the eyes; worse from noise, from light. "Pain in the occiput; worse from cold, better from external heat. Headache better while eating, but soon after it is worse."
"Disturbance of vision.
Zigzags.
Confusion of vision."
Excessively nervous eyes.
"Acrid tears.
Weeping."
Face: The face is distorted, convulsed, pale and sickly. Pains in the face. "Violent rending, tearing pains in the face."
Let me put it this way: Some of these overwrought girls that come back from Paris, that I described, overworked in their music, will have violent face-ache, pains in the face, or some other hysterical pains. Others will come back with violent headaches; others with the mental state and confusion; others with all the hysterical manifestations.
Prolonged excitement. Musical excesses. Yes, other girls come back fairly crippled with painful menstruation, ovarian pains, hysterical conditions, displacement; prolapsus of the vagina and of the rectum.
"Tearing, shooting pains upwards from the anus and vagina up into the body towards the umbilicus."
Strange antipathies run through the remedy. It will be impossible for you to ever form any conclusion what one of these sensitive women will think of any proposition that is presented. You cannot depend upon her being reasonable or rational.
It is best to say as little as possible, about anything. Make no promises, listen, look wise, take up your traveling bag and go home after you have prescribed, because anything you say, will be distorted. There is not anything you can say that will please
Thirst when you would not expect it. Thirst during chill, but none during the fever, if she has a feverish state. It is suitable in intermittent fever. Excitable, nervous children and women with intermittent fever.
Iodum (Iodine)
Anxiety: This remedy in all of its complaints whether acute or chronic, has a peculiar kind anxiety that is felt both in mind and body.
It seems also that this state of anxiety is attended with a thrill that goes throughout his frame unless he removes it by motion or change of position. The anxiety comes on when trying to keep still, and the more he tries to keep still the more the anxious state increases. While attempting to keep still, he is overwhelmed with impulses, impulses to tear things, to kill himself, to commit murder, to do violence.
He cannot keep still and so he walks night and day. This remedy carries the same feature with it into the Iodide of Potassium, so that it makes the Iodide of Potassium patient walk. But there is this difference, the Kali iod. patient can walk long distances without fatigue, and the walking only seems to wear off his anxiety, whereas in Iodine there is great exhaustion; he becomes extremely exhausted from walking and sweats copiously even from slight exertion.
Iodine corresponds to those cases in which it seems that there is some dreadful thing coming on; the mind threatens to give out. Insanity threatens, Or the graver forms of disease are threatening, such as are present in the advanced stages of suppressed malaria, in old cases of chills, in threatened phtysie, especially abdominal.
Hypertrophy: runs through the remedy.
There is enlargement of the liver, spleen, ovaries, testes, lymphatic glands, cervical glands, of all the glands except the mammary glands. The mammoe dwindle while all other glands become enlarged, nodular and hard.
This enlargement of the glands is especially observed among the lymphatic glands of the abdomen, the mesenteric glands.
There is this peculiar circumstance also in Iodine, viz., that while the body withers the glands enlarge. That is peculiar and will enable you to think of Iodine, because the glands grow in proportion to the dwindling of the body and the emaciation of the limbs. We find this state in marasmus. There is withering throughout the body, the muscles shrink, the skin wrinkles and the face of the child looks like that of a little old person, but the glands under the arms, in the groin and in the belly are enlarged and hard.
The mesenteric glands can be felt as knots. We see the same tendency in old cases of malaria coming from the allopaths in which Quinine and Arsenic have been extensively used and the chills have kept on; the face and the upper part of the body are withered, the skin looks shriveled and yellow; a diarrhoea has come on, the liver and spleen are enlarged and the lymphatic glands of the belly can be felt. Even in the earlier stages, when these states are only threatening, we may look forward and see that the case is progressing toward an Iodine state.
Now take a patient that is suffering from intermittent fever brought on from malaria, or damp cellars. The
patient grows increasingly hot; it is not always a febrile heat, but a sensation of heat; he wants to be bathed in cold water, wants the face and body cooled by cold sponging; he suffocates and coughs in a warm room,
dreads heat, sweats easily and easily becomes exhausted. It is in this kind of a constitution that acute
complaints will come on, such as acute inflammatory conditions of the mucous membranes and gastritis, inflammation of the liver, inflammation of the spleen, diarrhoea, croup, inflammation of the throat.
The throat even becomes covered with white spots and is tumid and red, and ibis extends down into the larynx; it may even have a deposit upon it like diphtheria. Iodine has cured diphtheria, when the exudation resembling the diphtheria exudations, was present in the stool. A constitution tending this way may bring on croup with an exudate, and we can see that it is going towards Iodine. In every region of the body peculiar little things come out. If we do not see to the full extent the constitution of the remedy, we will not recognize the tendency of the patient, when progressing unfavorably.
Mind: The mental state of this patient is that of excitement, anxiety, impulses, melancholy; he wants to do something, wants to hurry; he has impulses to kill. In this it is very closely related to Arsenicum and Hepar.
The Arsenicum and Hepar patients also have impulses to commit murder without being offended and without cause. The sensitiveness to heat will at once decide, for while Iodine is warm-blooded the Arsenicum and Hepar patients are always chilly.
The impulse to do violence is sudden. There are remedies that have peculiar impulses, impulses without any cause. These impulses are seen in cases of impulsive insanity; an insanity in which there is an impulse to do violence and strange things, and when the patient is asked why he does these things he says he does not know.
The patient may not be known to be insane in anything else; he may be a good business man. Remedies also have this. These things are forerunners. It is recorded under Hepar that a barber had an impulse w cut the
throat of his patron with the razor while shaving him.
The Nux vomica patient has an impulse to throw her child into the fire, or to kill her husband whom she dearly loves. The thought comes into her mind and increases until she becomes actually insane and beyond control and the impulse is carried into action.
A Natrum sulph. patient will say, "Doctor, you do not know how I have to resist killing myself. An impulse to do it comes into my mind."
Iodine has the impulse to kill, not from anger, not from any sense of justice, but without any cause. An overwhelming anger is often a cause for violence but the impulses are not of that sort in Iodine.
While reading; or thinking placidly at times a patient may have an impulse to do himself violence, and this finally grows until the end is a form of impulsive insanity.
The Iodine patient becomes weak in mind as well as in body; he is forgetful, cannot remember the little things, they pass out of the mind. He forgets what he was about to say or do; goes off and leaves packages he has purchased.
The forgetfulness is extensive. But with all these states, do not forget one thing, that the patient is compelled to keep doing something in order to drive away his impulses and anxiety.
The anxiety is wearing and distressing unless be keeps busy. Though mentally prostrated, he is compelled to keep busy and to continue the work, which increases the prostration of mind. You tell a man who is threatened with softening of the brain, from overwork, from anxiety and labor in literary work,
"You must stop working, you must rest." "Why," he will say, "If I do I would die or go mad."
Such a state comes under Iodine and Arsenicum, but there is one grand distinction by which the two remedies are seen to part company at once.
The Iodine patient is warm-blooded, wants a cool place to move in, and to think in, and to work in, whereas the Arsenicum patient wants heat, wants a warm room, wants to be warmly clothed, and suffers from the cold.
Iodine suffers from the heat. So that while the restlessness and anxiety, which are both of body and mind in each remedy, loom up before the mind as one, if the patient is a hot-blooded patient we would never think of Arsenicum; if a cold-blooded and shivering patient we would never think of Iodine.
Among the generals we first mentioned was the tendency to enlarged glands. Iodine has often cured a group of symptoms coming in the constitution that I have named, viz.; enlargement of the heart, enlargement of the thyroid and protruding eyeballs.
Now, if you have one of these patients (suppose it has been sent to you by somebody who knows no better than to call it exophthalmic goitre), those things that are so essential to the name of the disease, as they call it, would not be an indication for the remedy, but the indications would be found among those circumstances that I have given you that are outside of the projection of the eyes, the enlargement of the thyroid, the hypertrophy of the heart and the cardiac disturbances.
If the patient is emaciated, is sallow, suffers from heat, has enlarged glands, and the other symptoms of this medicine, you may expect after its administration an ultimate cessation of the group of symptoms that are selected to name the disease by. Brain troubles, acute and chronic, sometimes call for Iodine.
Head: The head throbs, the body throbs, there are pulsations all over, and the throbbing extends to the finger ends and the toes; throbbing in the pit of the stomach, heavy pulsations felt in the arms, pulsations in the back, throbbing in the temporal bone. There are congestive head aches with violent pain.
The head pains are aggravated from motion, but the patient is relieved from motion. The patient moves because his anxiety is relieved by motion, but every motion increases the head pains and the pulsation. Such distinctions are necessary. To distinguish between what is predicated of the patient and what is predicated of a part is an essential in the study of the Materia Medica.
Everything that is predicated of the patient is general, everything that is predicated of a part is particular. The two may be opposite, and hence the student of the Materia Medica will sometimes be worried because he will find aggravation from motion and relief from motion recorded under the same remedy. It is only from the source of the Materia Medica, i. e., the provings, and from the administration of the remedy that we may observe what is true of a part and what is true of the whole.
We find at times a patient wants to be in a hot room with the head out of the window for relief of the head. In that case the head is relived from cold and the body is relieved from heat. This is a typical symptom of Phosphorus, which has relief from cold as to the head and stomach symptoms, but aggravation from cold as to its chest and body symptoms.
Eo, if the Phosphorus patient has vomiting and head symptoms, he says:
"I want to go out in the open air and I want to take cold things into my stomach;" but if he has chest symptoms and pain in the extremities, he says:
"I want to go into the house and keep warm." And just as we see this in patients it is so in the study of a remedy; we must discriminate. Eyes: As you may except, all sorts of eye troubles are present in this debilitated constitution.
The so-called scrofulous affections of the eyes, with ulceration of the cornea, catarrhal troubles, discharge from the eyes, enlargement of the little glands of the lids, come along with the emaciation and yellow countenance in the constitution described. Optical illusions in bright colors. An oedematous state is in keeping with Iodine.
There is oedematous swelling of the lids and oedematous swelling of the face under the eyes. Iodine has also oedema of the hands and feet, and carries this tendency with it into the Iodide of Potassium, which has oedematous swellings like those we find in kidney affections. it is capable of putting a stop to cases of Bright’s disease in the early stages.
Hunger: Another grand feature that runs through the complaints of Iodine is hunger.
He is always hungry. The eating of the ordinary and regular meals is not sufficient. He eats between meals and yet is hungry. Moreover the complaints are better after eating.
All the fears, the anxiety and distress of Iodine increase when he is hungry. There is pain in the stomach when the stomach is empty, and he is driven to eat. While eating he forgets his complaints, because it is
like doing something, it is like moving, his mind is upon something else. He is relieved while eating and he is relieved while in motion. In spite of the hunger and much eating he still emaciates.
"Living well yet growing thin," was one of Hering's key-notes of Iodine.
As in Natr. mur. and Abrotanum, he emaciates while he has at the same time an enormous appetite. The nutrition is so disturbed that there is no making of flesh, and hence the emaciation.
Nose: The catarrhal condition of the nose is worthy of notice.
The Iodine patient has loss of the sense of smell. The mucous membrane is thickened; he takes cold upon the slightest provocation; is always sneezing and has from the nose a copious watery discharge.
Ulceration in the nose with bloody crusts; he blows blood from the nose. The nose is stuffed up so that he cannot breathe through it.
This increases every time he takes cold, and he is continually taking cold hence he becomes a confirmed subject of catarrh. I have described the general state. The patient is the first to be thought of. His constitution is the first thing to know, i. e., what is true of the patient as a whole. After that we can find out what is true of each of his parts.
The mucous membrane of the nose is constantly in a state of ulceration, or has a tendency to ulceration. Sometimes these little ulcers are deep.
There are aphthous patches along the tongue and throughout the mouth. The whole buccal cavity is studded with aphthous patches.
I have mentioned already the tendency to exudation; white velvety, or white-grayish or pale ash-colored exudations come upon the sore throat, all over the mucous membrane of the nose and all over the pharynx.
The pharynx seems to be lined with the velvety, ash colored appearances. With these throat symptoms and the tendency to ulceration it has a wide range of usefulness in throat affections. It is useful in enlargement of the tonsils when the tonsils are studded with exudations and in the constitution described.
Enlarged tonsils in hungry, withered patients. We often see one who is subject to quinsy progressing toward the Iodine state. He is always suffering from the heat like a Pulsatilla patient; at times in the earlier stages, before any organic changes have taken place, you may mistake Iodine for Pulsatilla. But if you watch the patient you will observe the tendency to emaciation and see that the two remedies soon part company.
They are both hot, they are both irritable, they are both full of notions. The Pulsatilla patient is far more whimsical, more tearful, has greater sadness, and has constant loss of appetite, while the Iodine subject wants to eat much.
The Pulsatilla patient often increases in flesh, although growing increasingly nervous. The Iodine patient becomes thin, has a ravenous hunger, cannot be satisfied, suffers from his hunger; he must eat every few
hours and feels better after eating; he has also great thirst. If he goes long without eating, no matter what the complaints are, the suffering will increase. Any of the complaints of iodine will likely be increased by
fasting.
Iodine has also an indigestion that comes from overeating. The food sours, he is troubled with sour eructations, with much flatulence, with belching, with undigested stools, with diarrhoea, watery, cheesy stools, and he digests less and less. The digestion becomes more and more feeble until he digests almost nothing of what he eats, and yet the craving increases. He vomits and diarrhoea comes on and so he increasingly emaciates; because it is like burning the candle at both, ends. It is not surprising that he is extremely weak because lie is assimilating very little of what he takes.
The articles of food act as foreign substances to disorder his bowels and stomach. Now, with this trouble going on, the liver and spleen become hard and enlarged, and the patient becomes jaundiced. The stool is hard, lumpy and white, or colorless, or clay colored, sometimes soft and pappy; there seems to be little or no bile in it.
This stage gradually increases until hypertrophy of the liver comes on. Finally the abdomen sinks ill and reveals this enlargement of the liver and the enlarged lymphatic glands.
These are very knotty and as hard as in tabes mesenterica. Iodine is indicated in the tubercular condition of the mesenteric glands with diarrhoea, emaciation, great hunger, great thirst, withering of the mammary glands, a dried beef-like or shriveled appearance of the skin and sallow complexion. If the remedy is given
early enough, before the structural changes have occurred, it will check the progress of the disease and cure.
Diarrhea: This is a very useful remedy in the chronic morning diarrhea of emaciated, scrofulous children.
When the constitutional state is present it is primary to the varying kinds of stools that it is possible for the patient to have.
So if you have a marked state of the constitution, a case in which there are a great number of general symptoms for you to associate the remedy with, the little symptoms of the diarrhoea cease to be important. The constitutional state in that patient is that which is "strange, rare and peculiar."
Almost any kind of diarrheic stool will be cured if the constitutional state is covered by the remedy.
When it is an acute diarrhoea and it occurs in a vigorous constitution, and there is nothing but the diarrhoea, then it is necessary to know all the finer details, and the characteristics of the diarrhoea become the rare,
"strange and peculiar" features.
Incontinence of urine in old people. In the male with all these constitutional symptoms iodine is especially suited when the testes have dwindled, when there is impotency, when there is flowing of semen with dreams, when there is loss of sexual instinct or power, or with an irritated state, an erethism of the sexual instinct; also when the testes are enlarged and hard, indurated and hypertrophied like the other glands, or when there is an orchitis, an inflammation and enlargement of the testicles.
Swelling and induration of the uterus and ovaries. Iodine has cured tumors of the ovaries in such a constitution as I have described. It has cured the dwindling of the mammary glands and caused them to grow plump with an increase of flesh upon dwindling patients.
Its nature to produce the catarrhal state is illustrated in the leucorrhea that it produces. Uterine leucorrhoea with swelling and induration of the cervix. Uterus enlarged, tendency to menorrhagia. Leucorrhea rendering the thighs sore.
The discharges of Iodine are acrid. The discharges from the nose excoriate the lip, the discharges from the eyes excoriate the cheek, the discharges from the vagina excoriate the thighs. The leucorrhoea is thick and slimy and sometimes bloody; "chronic leucorrhoea, most abundant at the time of the menses, rendering the thighs sore and corroding the linen."
This remedy has a cough that is violent; it has grave and severe difficulties of respiration, dyspnoea, with chest symptoms.
Croupy, suffocating cough in this delicate constitution. Again we say if you do not hold in mind the constitutional state while reading these very numerous respiratory symptoms, you will not be able to apply them because they are extensive and include a great many so-called complaints and would give you difficulty in individualizing them.
Now, there is one more complaint that I wish to call your attention to. In old gouty constitutions, with enlargement of the joints, the history is that the patients were once in a good state of flesh, but they have
become lean, and although they are hungry, the food does not seem to do them good. The joints are enlarged and tender.
Many gouty constitutions want a warm room, but the Iodine patient wants a cool room. His joints pain and are aggravated from the warmth of bed. He cheers up in a cool place and likes to be in the open air.
He is growing increasingly weak; he is generally ameliorated on moving about and eating, he has the anxiety of body and mind.
Iodine will put a check on his gouty attacks and cause him to go on comfortably for a while.
Ipecac
Ipecac. has a wide sphere of action among acute sickness. Most of its acute complaints commence with nausea, vomiting.
The febrile conditions commence with pain in the back between the shoulders, extending down the back, as if it would break, with or without rigors, much fever, vomiting of bile and seldom any thirst. This is the general aspect of the beginning of an Ipecac. fever or gastric. trouble or chill in intermittents or bilious attacks.
The stomach is disordered. There is a sense of fullness in the stomach, cutting pains in the stomach and below the stomach, going from left to right. The cutting pain in colic goes from left to right. The patient is unable to stir or breathe until that pain passes off. It holds him transfixed in one position, coming like the stabbing of a knife in the region of the stomach, or above the navel, going from left to right, and is attended with prostration and nausea.
Nausea: All the complaints in Ipecac. are attended more or less with nauseq; every little pain and distress is attended with nausea. The sufferings seem to centre about the stomach, bringing on nausea.
There is continuous nausea, and gagging. The cough causes nausea and vomiting. It is a dry, hacking, teasing, suffocative cough, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He coughs until his face grows red, and then there is choking and gagging. With every little gush of blood from any part of the body there is nausea, fainting and sinking.
Hence its value in uterine hemorrhages; bright, red blood with nausea; a little blood is attended with fainting or syncope, but the great overwhelming nausea runs through the complaints of this remedy. Though there is sometimes thirst, it is usually absent. When Ipecac. does its best work, there is thirstlessness.
With the Ipecac. fever, or with the chill, there is likely to be pain in the back of the head, a bruised pain through the head and back of the neck and sometimes down the back, and drawing in the muscles of the back of the neck. A congestive fullness in the head, a crushed feeling in the head and back of the head; the whole head aches and is full of pain.
Ipecac. is sometimes as restless as Arsenic., but the Ipecac. prostration comes by spells, whereas the Arsenic prostration is continuous. You will see Ipecac. patients tossing over the bed as much as they do when they need Rhus, turning and tossing, and moving the hands and feet, with restlessness.
This is especially the case when the spine is somewhat involved. Ipecac. has symptoms that look like tetanus it has opisthotonos, and it has been a useful remedy in cerebro-spinal meningitis with vomiting of bile, with pain in the back of the head and neck, and drawing of the muscles of the back, retracting the head.
Stomach: When cerebro-spinal meningitis has gone on until the patient is emaciated, when remedies have seemed but to palliate momentarily, and the whole body is inclined backwards, and there is vomiting of everything, even the simplest article taken into the stomach, the tongue is red and raw, and there is constant nausea and vomiting of bile, Ipecac. will cure.
Ipecac. cures inveterate cases of gastritis when even a drop of water will not stay down; everything put in the stomach is vomited, continuous gagging, sharp pain in the stomach, pain in the back, below the shoulder blades, as if it would break, vomiting of bile, continuous nausea and great prostration. Irritable stomach. It also cures when the abdomen is distended, and sensitive, a tympanitic state, when there is vomiting of bile.
Ipecac. has proved a useful remedy in epidemic dysentery, when the patient is compelled to sit almost constantly upon the stool and passes a little slime, or a little bright red blood; inflammation of the lower portion of the bowel, the rectum and the colon. The tenesmus is awful, burning, and continuous urging with the passage of only a little mucus, and blood. With this there is constant nausea; while straining at stool, the pain is so great that nausea comes on, and he vomits bile. At times, whole families are down with it. It runs through a whole valley and may be epidemic, but it commonly relates to endemics.
In infants, it is indicated when a cholera-like diarrhoea has been present and it ends in a dysenteric state, with continued tenesmus, and the expulsion of a little bloody mucus, the child vomiting everything it takes into the stomach; nausea, vomiting, prostration and great pallor. It is also useful in such conditions when the stool is more or less copious, and is green, and the child passes, frequently, copious quantities of green slime. Much crying when at stool, much straining, with passages of green slime, vomiting of green slime, and vomiting of green curds; milk turns green and is vomited.
Chest: The chest complaints of Ipecac. are interesting. Ipecac. is especially the infant's friend and is commonly indicated in the bronchitis of infancy. The usual bad cold that ends in chest trouble in infants is a bronchitis.
It is very seldom that an infant gets a true pneumonia, it is generally a bronchitis with coarse rattling. The child coughs, gags and suffocates, and there is coarse rattling which can be heard throughout the room, and the trouble has come on pretty rapidly. The child is pale, looks dreadfully sick, and sometimes looks very anxious. The nose is drawn in as if dangerously ill, and the breathing is such as appears in a dangerous case. Ipecac. will sometimes modify this into a very simple case, break up the cold, and cure the child.
In the old books, the pneumonia of infancy had a distinct and separate description, and the typical symptoms were those of Ipecac. You will see a great similarity of symptoms when you study Ipecac. and Ant. tart. together in chest troubles. If you have been studying them together, you will say,
"How do you distinguish them; they both have rattling cough and breathing, and both have the vomiting?"
Well, the Ipecac. symptoms correspond to the stage of irritation, while the Tartar emetic symptoms appear in the stage of relaxation. That is, the Ipecac. symptoms come on hurriedly, come on as the acute symptoms, whereas the Tartar emetic complaints come on slowly. The latter is seldom suited to symptoms that arise within twenty-four hours, or at least the symptoms of Tartar emetic that arise in twenty-four hours are not of this class.
This group comes on many days later, comes on at the close of a bronchitis when there is threatened paralysis of the lungs; not in the state of irritation, not the dyspnoea from irritation, not the suffocation of that sort, but the suffocation from exudation, and from threatened paralysis of the lungs.
When the lungs are too weak to expel the mucus the coarse rattling comes on. Then there is the great exhaustion, deathly pallor of the face and sooty nostrils.
We see now that these two remedies do not look alike. If we observe the pace of the two remedies, we see that the complaints differ. It is not so much. that they belong to stages, although they do, but rather that Ipecac. brings on its symptoms rapidly and effects a crisis speedily, and that Ant. tart. brings on its symptoms slowly and effects a crisis after many days.
You can readily see the value of Ipecac. in whooping cough, for it has the paroxysmal character, the red face, and vomiting and gagging with the cough. The red face, thirstlessness, violent whooping, with convulsions, with gagging and vomiting of all that he eats are the symptoms that you will generally find.
Haemorrhages: I have hinted at the haemorrhages, and these open out a great field for Ipecac. I could not practice medicine without ipecac., because of its importance in hemorrhages. When I say haemorrhages, I do not mean those from cut arteries, | do not mean haemorrhages where surgery must come in; I mean such as uterine haemorrhages, haemorrhages from the kidneys, from the bowels, from the stomach, from the lungs.
You must know your remedies in haemorrhages; if you do not, you will be forced to use mechanical means; but the homeopathist who is well instructed is able to do without them. In the severest form of uterine hemorrhages, the homeopathic physician is able to do without mechanical means, except when mechanical means are causing the haemorrhage.
This does not relate to hourglass contractions, it does not relate to conditions when the after birth is retained, or when the uterus has a foreign substance in it, because under such circumstances manipulation is necessary.
A distinction must be made. But when we have simply the pure dynamic element to consider, simply and purely a relaxed surface that is bleeding, the remedy is the only thing that will do the work properly. When the uterus is continuously oozing, but every little while the flow increases to a gush, and with every little gush of bright red blood the woman thinks she is going to faint, or there is gasping, and the quantity of the flow is not sufficient to account for such prostration, nausea, syncope, pallor, Ipecac. is the remedy.
When with the gushing of bright red blood there is an overwhelming fear of death, Aconite. If your patient while going through the confinement has had a hot head, an uncontrollable thirst for ice cold water, and after the confinement, everything has gone on in an orderly way, and the placenta has been delivered, and although you have no reason to expect such haemorrhage it comes on, Phosphorus will nearly always be the remedy.
In those withered women, lean and slender, who are always suffering from the heat, who want the covers off and want to be cool, who have had a tendency to ooze blood from the uterus, and now have a
haemorrhage that is alarming either with clots, or only an oozing of dark liquid blood, you can hardly do without Secale. A single dose of any one of these medicines on the tongue will check a haemorrhage more quickly than large doses of strong medicine.
The haemorrhage will be checked so speedily that in your earlier experiences you will be surprised. You will wonder if it is not possible that it stopped itself. In copious menstruation Ipecac. is often indicated When the woman has taken cold, or has a shock. In cases where she is not especially subject to copious uterine flow at the menstrual period, she is naturally alarmed, for it is something she has never bad before, and the flow is likely to continue for many days, attended with this weakness. All her power seems to go with a little gush of blood. Ipecac. will cure and end the menstrual flow normally. A fortunate thing in nature is the tendency to check haemorrhage, which is always good.
There are a large number of medicines that control haemorrhage, and these you must keep at your finger's ends. They belong to emergencies. You must know the remedies that correspond to violent symptoms and violent attacks. Ipecac. is full of hemorrhage. Vomiting of great clots of blood, continuous vomiting of blood in connection with ulceration. In persons who are subject to violent attacks of bleeding, who bleed easily, who have a haemorrhagic tendency, Ipecac. will control temporarily the haemorrhage when the symptoms agree.
Urines: Severe pain in the back in the region of the kidneys, shooting pains, frequent urging to urinate, and the urine contains blood and little clots of blood. The urine is extremely red with blood, which settles to the bottom of the vessel, and lines the whole commode with a layer of blood the thickness of a knife blade. Every pint of urine that it contains will have that coating of blood in the vessel; every attack of pain in the kidney is attended with that condition of the urine. Ipecacuanha will stop that bleeding. It is true that when patients have bled until they have become anaemic, and are subject to dropsy, Ipecac. ceases to be the remedy; its natural follower then is China, which will bring the patient in a position to need an antipsoric remedy.
Colds: Then there are the "colds."
Simple, common coryzas among the children. When a cold settles in the nose, and the nose is stuffed up at night or when the adult has a coryza, with much stuffing up of the nose, blowing of mucus and blood from the nose, much sneezing, and the cold goes further down and is followed by hoarseness, extending into the trachea with rawness, and finally into the bronchial tubes with suffocation and settling in the chest, think of ipecac.
The Ipecac. colds often begin in the nose and spread very rapidly into the chest. With these colds in the nose there is copious bleeding of bright red blood. Every time he takes cold in the nose he has copious bleeding; a tendency to nosebleed with the colds. The inflammation that comes upon the mucous membrane in Ipecac. is violent.
The irritation comes on suddenly, and the mucous membrane inflames so rapidly that the parts become purple, turgescent, and bleeding seems to be the only natural relief. Stoppage of the nose and loss of smell; the nose becomes so stuffed up that he cannot breathe through it.
With the head symptoms, with the colds, with the whooping cough, with the chill, and with many of the inflammatory complaints, the face becomes flushed, bright red, or bluish red, and the lips blue; with the chill the lips and the finger nails are blue. The chill is violent, sometimes congestive in character and often a rigor. The whole frame shakes, and the teeth chatter.
There are old incurable cases of asthma that are palliated by Ipecac. and carry around a bottle of it from which they say they get much relief. It is useful in cases of humid asthma, in cases of asthmatic bronchitis, when they suffer from the damp weather and from sudden weather changes; every little cold rouses up this bronchial attack, and he suffocates and gags when he coughs, or spits up a little blood.
He has to sit up nights to breathe, and the attacks are common and frequent. These patients say they get relief front Ipecac., and it is not surprising that Ipecac. relieves that state of asthmatic breathing, because it has such symptoms. Some of these cases are incurable, they are people advanced in life.
This remedy, more wisely administered, will give more relief. A powder of Ipecac. will break up the attack, so that the patient is comfortable, and then will go on in an ordinary sort of asthmatic way, until catching another cold. The cough is rattling and asthmatic.
Convulsions: As a convulsive medicine Ipecac. is not well enough known.
Convulsions in pregnancy. Convulsions in whooping cough; frightful spasms, affecting the whole of the left side, followed by paralysis; clonic and tonic spasms of children and hysterical women. Tetanus, rigidity of the body, with flushed redness of the face.
These are strong features of Ipecac., and they have not been sufficiently dwelt upon, and the remedy is not sufficiently known as having these states so prominently. Medicines like Belladonna are more frequently spoken of in the books and in treatises of spasms, yet Ipecac. is just as important a remedy to be studied in relation to spasms, and its action upon the spine.
Skin: In suppressed eruptions, the symptoms will very commonly point to Ipecac.
When the eruption does not come out, or an eruption has been driven back by cold, sometimes acute manifestations of stomach and bowels follow and colds settle in the chest from suppressed eruptions, Ipecac. will also cure erysipelas, when there is the vomiting, the chill, the pain in the back, the thirstlessness and the overwhelming nausea.
Ipecac. is often sufficient for the nausea and vomiting when the scarlet fever rash is slow to come out. Instead of the rash coming out as it should, Ipecac. symptoms come on in the stomach with nausea and vomiting. Ipecac. will check the nausea and vomiting, will bring out the eruption, and the disease will run a milder course.
Kalium Bichromicum
This remedy is recognized by most physicians by the copious ropy mucous discharges from all mucous membranes, but it is also a most important remedy in rheumatic affections of the joints with swelling, heat and redness, whenever these conditions wander around from joint to joint.
The bones all over the body feel bruised, and caries is reckoned among its symptoms. A marked feature of this remedy is the alternation between catarrhal symptoms and rheumatic pains. Exudations from mucous membranes, somewhat like croup, are found in the larynx, trachea and in the rectum. it is not surprising, therefore, that it has proved a very effective remedy in diphtheria. It emaciates, like the rest of the Kali salts. We have running through it the cachectic conditions, or malignant diseases with ulceration; and especially is it indicated when the ulceration period is present.
Ulceration: is a striking feature of this remedy. Its ulcers are deep; are said to be as if punched out and are very red. Gouty conditions are as common in this remedy as in the other Kalis.

Pains are sometimes very violent; sometimes shooting; sometimes stitching stinging; again aching. Burning is a very marked symptom of the remedy. The pains appear rapidly and disappear suddenly.
Cold and warm: The patient is sensitive to cold. There is a lack of vital heat. In fact, he wants to be wrapped up and covered warmly, and many of his complaints are much better when he is perfectly warm in bed. All the pains and his cough are relieved from the warmth of the bed, and yet there are other complaints, like rheumatic conditions, that come on in hot weather.
The cough is better in warm weather and worse in winter. Catarrhal conditions of the larynx and trachea are worse in winter, especially in the cold, damp weather, like Calc. phos. when the snow melts. Sensitive to cold winds. Causticum, it ill be remembered, is sensitive to cold, dry winds.
The Kalis generally are sensitive to cold, dry weather, but Kali bichromicum throat troubles are continuous in the winter and during cold, damp weather, and are worse in cold, damp winds. It is a most useful remedy in septic and zymotic fevers.
Many of its symptoms are aggravated about 2 or 3 A.M., like Kali carb. Most of the symptom are worse in the morning yet some come on in the night. A marked feature of Kali. bichromicum is a feeling of great weakness and weariness. When the pain has passed off, if in the limbs, the limbs are felt very weary. Great prostration and cold sweat.

The symptoms generally, especially the pains, are worse from motion, except the sciatic and some of the pains in the lower limbs, which are better from motion. The patient pulsates all over the body.
There are very few mental symptoms owing to the fact that the remedy has been proved only in crude form. It needs to be proved in potencies to bring out the mental symptoms.

A Kali bichromicum patient always suffers more or less from catarrh of the nose, and if he is exposed to cold weather the catarrhal condition will turn to dryness; then will come on violent headache; also headaches during coryza.
Headaches during coryza when the discharge of the coryza slacks up a little. Headaches often begin with dim vision. Pains are violent.

It is a very useful remedy in nausea and vomiting of drunkards and beer drinkers. When a beer drinker has arrived at a point where he can no longer tolerate his beer but it makes him sick, Kali bichromicum is a useful remedy. In the stomach there is also soreness and coldness. It is a very useful remedy in ulceration of
the stomach; and when such ulcer is cancerous it relieves the pain, stops the vomiting, makes the patient comfortable for a long time.
In other words, it palliates him. There are some pains in the stomach that are ameliorated by eating; nausea sometimes is ameliorated, but such is the exception.

Kalium Carbonicum
The Kali carb. patient is a hard patient to study, and the remedy itself is a hard one to study.
It is not used as often as it should be, and the reason is that it is a very complex and confusing remedy. It has a great many opposite symptoms, changing symptoms, and thus it is related to patients that withhold their symptoms and have many vague symptoms.
Mind: The patient is whimsical, irascible, irritable to the very highest degree, quarrels with his family and with his bread and butter. He never wants to be alone, is full of fear and imaginations when alone, "fear of the future, fear of death, fear of ghosts."
If compelled to remain alone in the house he is wakeful, sleepless, or his sleep is full of horrible dreams. He is never at peace, is full of imaginations and fear.
"What if the house should burn up!"
"What if I should do this or that!" and
"What if this and the other thing should happen! "
He is oversensitive to everything, sensitive to every atmospheric change; he can never get the room at just exactly the right temperature; he is sensitive to every draft of air and to the circulation of air in the room. He cannot have the windows open, even in a distant part of the house. He will get up at night in bed and
look around to see where that draft of air comes from. His complaints are worse in wet weather, and in cold weather.
Pains: He is sensitive to the cold and is always shivering. His nerves feel the cold; they are all painful when it is cold. The neuralgias shoot here and there when it is cold, and if the part affected be kept warm, the
pain goes to some other place. All his pains change place and go into the cold part; if he covers up one part, the pain goes to the part uncovered.
This remedy is full of sticking, burning, tearing pains, and these fly around from place to place. Of course Kali carb. has pains that remain in one place, but usually the pains fly, around in every direction, Pains cutting like knives. Pains like hot needles, sticking, stinging and burning.
These pains are felt in internal parts and dry passages. Burning in the anus and rectum, described as if a hot poker were forced into that passage; burning as with fire. The hemorrhoids burn like coals of fire. The burning of Kali carb. is like that of Arsenicum.
Again from studying the text it will be seen that it is a common feature of this medicine to have its symptoms come on at 2, 3 or 5 o'clock in the morning. In Kali carb. the cough will come or have its greatest < at three or four or five o'clock in the morning.
The febrile state will occur from 3-5 in the morning. The patient, who is subject to asthmatic dyspnoea, will have an attack at 3 o'clock in the morning, waking him out of sleep. He will wake up with various symptoms and remain awake until 5 o'clock in the morning, and after that to a great extent they are relieved.
Of course, there are plenty of sufferings at any time in the twenty-four hours, but this is the worst time. He wakes up at 3 o'clock in the morning with fear, fear of death, fear of the future, worries about everything and is kept awake for 2-3 hours and then goes to sleep and sleeps soundly.
His body is cold and requires much clothing to keep it warm, but in spite of the fact that he is cold he sweats copiously; copious, cold sweat upon the body. Sweats upon the slightest exertion, sweats where the pain is, sweat over the forehead; cold sweat on the forehead with headache.
Neuralgia of the scalp and the eyes and the cheek bones in association with the nervous shooting pains. Violent pains here and there in the head, as if the head would be crushed. Cutting and stabbing, in the head. Violent congestive headaches as if the head were full. Head hot on one side and cold on the other; forehead covered with cold sweat.
Head: It has catarrhal congestive headache.
Whenever he goes out in the cold air, the nose opens up and the mucous membranes become dry and burn; when he returns into a warm room the nose commences to discharge, and the nose stuffs up so that he cannot breathe through it, and then he feels most comfortable; so that it has stuffing up of the nose in a warm room, and opening up of the nose in the open air. When the nose is open so that he can breathe through it, that is the time the head is most painful; it is painful to the cold air and the cold air makes it burn.
The cold air feels hot. All these patients suffer from a chronic catarrh and when they ride in the wind the catarrhal discharge ceases and then will come on a headache, and thus he has headache from riding in the cold wind.
Whenever the discharge ceases from taking cold in a draft on comes headache, and as the discharge becomes free again the headache is relieved. Neuralgic pains in eyes and scalp and through the cheek bones from a cessation of chronic catarrhal discharge, and when the discharge starts up again, these pain cease.
With the chronic catarrh of the nose there is a thick, fluent, yellow discharge; dryness of the nose, alternating with stuffing up. The one who suffers from a chronic catarrh will also have the discharge in the
morning, which will fill up the nose with yellow mucus. In the morning he blows out and hawks up dry, hard crusts that fill up the nasal passage, clear over into the pharynx and down into the throat.
These crusts become dry as if they were partly formed upon the mucous membrane and when they are blown out there is bleeding. The bleeding starts from where the crusts are lifted up. He is subject to sore throat, is always taking cold, and it settles in the throat. He is also subject to enlarged tonsils and with these has enlargement and chronic hardness of the parotid glands-one or both. Great knots below the ear, behind the jaw.
These grow and become hard, and at times, painful; shooting, darting pains when he is moving about in the open air. When air strikes these enlarged glands they are sore and painful, and he is ameliorated by going into a warm place.
The acute colds extend into the chest, but Kali carb. has been found most suitable in the chronic catarrh of the chest, chronic bronchitis.
Chest: The chest is very often affected in just the same way as the nose.
There is the dryness and dry barking, hacking cough in cold air, but a copious expectoration of mucus when it becomes warm, and that is the time he is most comfortable, for the expectoration seems to relieve him. He suffers mostly from a dry, hacking cough with morning expectoration. The cough begins with a dry, hacking, increases gradually and sometimes very rapidly to a violent. Spasmodic cough with gagging or vomiting, and when coughing it feels as if his head would fly to pieces.
Face: The face becomes puffed, the eyes seem to protrude and then there is seen that which is commonly present in Kali carb., a peculiar sort of a swelling between the eyelids and eyebrows that fills up when coughing.
Your attention is called to that peculiar feature, for although there may be bloating nowhere else upon the face that little bagging will appear above the lid and below the eye brow. It fills up sometimes to the extent of a little water bag.
Such a swelling has been produced by Kali carb., and sometimes that symptom alone guides to the examination of the remedy for the purpose of ascertaining if Kali carb. does not fit all the rest of the case.
Boenninghausen speaks of an epidemic of whooping cough in which the majority of cases called for Kali carb., and this striking feature was present. No remedy should ever be given on one symptom. If you are led to aremedy by a peculiar symptom, study the remedy and the disease thoroughly to ascertain if the two are similar enough to each other to expect a cure. Any deviation from that rule is ruinous and will lead to the practice of giving medicines on single symptoms.
Dry, hacking incessant, gagging cough with whooping, blowing of blood from the nose, vomiting of everything in the stomach, and expectoration of blood-streaked mucus, is a whooping cough that will be commonly cured by Kali carb., but especially if there is present that peculiar and striking feature of a bag- like swelling below the eyebrow and above the lids, puffiness of the eyes.
There are some cases of pneumonia that need Kali carb, in the stage of hepatization (like Sulph.). Again, when pneumonia has passed away think of Kali carb. if every time the patient takes a little cold it settles in the chest with these symptoms that I have described.
There is sensitiveness of the body to weather changes, to cold air and to wet, a continuous dry, hacking cough, with gagging, the aggravation from three to five the morning, and the patient, has flying neuralgic pains. These symptoms gradually increase and the patient dates them back to his pneumonia. He says:
"Doctor, I have never been quite well since I had pneumonia."
The catarrhal state has settled in his chest and there is a chronic tendency to take cold. These cases are threatening to go into phthisis and will hardly be likely to recover without Kali carb. In this tendency for catarrhal states to locate in the chest, Kali carb. should be thought of as well as Phosphor., Lycopod. and Sulphur.
Dropsies: Another general state that belongs to this remedy is a tendency to dropsies.
It has dropsies all over the body. The feet bloat and the fingers puff; the back of the hands pit upon pressure, the face looks puffy and waxy. The heart is weak. I can look back upon quite a number of cases of fatty degeneration of the heart in which I could have prevented all the trouble with Kali carb. if 1 had known the case better in the beginning.
These cases are insidious, and the indications calling for Kali carb. must be seen early or the patient will advance into an incurable condition. That peculiar state of weakness and feeble circulation that finally ends in dropsy and many other complications has its likeness in Kali carb.
There is an insidiousness about Kali carb. in the approach of all of its complaints.
He has a sort of nondescript appearance, he is withered, has much dyspnoea upon going up hill or even walking on the level. Examination of the lungs shows them to be in very fair condition, but finally complications come on, there is a break down and organic changes and you look back over these cases and say, if I had only seen in the beginning of this case what I see now it seems as if the patient ought to have been cured.
We learn the beginnings of remedies as we learn the beginnings of sickness. It is a prudent thing for a homoeopathic physician to glance back over a case that he has failed on, or someone else has failed on, to study its beginnings and see what the manifestations were. This kind of study to the homoeopathic physician is as delightful as post mortems are to the old school.
Teeth: The teeth present a peculiar state. The gums take on a scorbutic or scrofulous character. The gums separate from the teeth and the teeth decay and become discolored and loose, so that they have to be extracted early in life.
He suffers from pain in the teeth whenever he takes cold from riding in the wind and raw weather. The pains come on even when the teeth are not yellow or decayed: stitching, tearing, rending pains in the teeth. Offensive smell from the teeth; pus oozing out from around the teeth. The mouth is full of little ulcers, little aphthous patches. The mucous membrane is pale and ulcerates daily. The tongue is white with offensive taste; coated gray, with sick headaches.
While many of the symptoms of Kali carb, are aggravated after eating, some symptoms are relieved after eating. There is throbbing in the pit of the stomach when the stomach is empty. There is also throbbing all over the body, pulsation to the fingers and toes; there is no part that does not pulsate, and he is kept awake by this pulsation. Pulsation even when there is often no feeling of palpitation in the region of the heart. It has also violent palpitation of the heart.
Stomach: Kali carb. fits many old dyspeptics.
After eating be feels as if he would burst, so bloated is he. Great flatulence; belches wind upwards and passes flatus downwards; offensive flatus. The belching up is also attended with fluid eructations, sour fluids that set the teeth on edge; they excoriate, or cause smarting in the pharynx or mouth. Pain in the stomach after eating; burning in the stomach after eating.
Gone feeling in the stomach, that is not even relieved by eating. A peculiar condition in Kali carb. is a state of anxiety felt in the stomach, as though it were a fear. One of the first patients I ever had expressed it in a better way than it is expressed in the books; she said,
"Doctor, somehow or other I don't have a fear like other people do, because I have it in my stomach." She said when she was frightened, it always struck to her stomach.
"Ifa door slams, I feel it right here” (epigastric region).
Well, that is striking, that is peculiar. It was not long before I developed another feature of Kali carb.
By a little awkwardness on my part my knee happened to hit the patient's foot as it projected a little over the edge of the bed, and the patient said, "Oh"
Sure enough that was Kali carb. again, for you will find in Kali carb. a patient that is afraid and everything goes to the stomach and when touched upon the skin there is an anxiety or fear or apprehension felt in the region of the stomach.
You might imagine that it is connected with the solar plexus, but the symptom is the all in all to the physician.
Feet: A Kali carb. patient is so sensitive in the soles of the feet that the mere touch of the sheet brings a sensation of thrill throughout the body. Hard pressure is all right, it does not disturb, but something that comes unawares excites.
The Kali carb. patient is over sensitive to all the surrounding things, over sensitive to touch; shivering from the simplest and lightest touch, even when hard pressure is agreeable. Violently ticklish in the soles of the feet. I have often examined the feet when a patient would shiver and draw up the feet and scream out,
"Don't tickle my feet." I had probably touched it so lightly that I did not know that I had touched it at all.
In Lach. also gentle touch is painful, while hard pressure is agreeable but here it is not so much the ticklishness. In Lach. the abdomen is so sensitive that the touch of the sheet is painful. I have seen Lach. patients using a hoop to keep a light sheet from touching the abdomen. You may know then that you are in the realm of Lachesis, and that it is like those persons who are unable to bear the slightest touch upon the neck and suffer from uneasiness on wearing a collar.
All that, however, is different from this state of ticklishness. I have seen patients who are really so sensitive in the skin that I would not dare touch it, unless they knew just where I was going to touch.
"Now | am going to feel your pulse, hold still." If I were to touch the hand, or reach out to feel the pulse without warning there would be a thrill.
Such a state is in keeping with Kali carb. These things often have to be dug out by observation in studying the nature of provings, and associating things. These things that run into the oversensitiveness of patients are of great value clinically. The capabilities of our Materia Medica are something wonderful, but they could be developed much more rapidly if a number of homoeopathic physicians would make application of the Materia Medica with accuracy and intelligence, observing what they see and relating it literally.
At the present day there is only a very small number of homoeopathic physicians that can come together in a body and say things that are worth listening to, a shamefully small number when we consider the length of time Hahnemann's books have been before the world.
Liver: There are many old chronic liver subjects who talk about nothing else but the liver.
Every time they go to the doctor's office they talk about the liver, and about a condition of fullness in the region of the liver and pain through the right shoulder blade and up through the right side of the chest, with a good deal of oppression and distension; vomiting of bile and a good deal of stomach disorder, fullness after eating; attacks of diarrhoea, alternating with constipation lasting for many days with great straining at stool.
Periodical bilious attacks, when a constipated state is present; cannot lie down at night; difficult breathing at night or at 3 o'clock in the morning, especially when it is in a patient over-sensitive to cold, damp weather, one who wants to sit by the fire all the time.
These liver subjects are often thoroughly cured by Kali carb. Sometimes they have been resorting to all sorts of liver tappings, taking such medicines as purge or cause vomiting, drugs that really aggravate the trouble. Kali carb. goes to the bottom of these cases, and roots out the evil.
Abdomen: In the abdomen we have many Kali carb. symptoms.
Persons subjected to repeated attacks of colic, cutting pains, with distension, with pain after eating, constipation or diarrhoea. Colic, with cutting, tearing pains, doubling him up, coming on every little while. Tremendous flatulence. When the attack of colic is on it might remind you of Colocynth or of some other of the acute remedies that cure colic in two or three minutes, but you will find that these acute remedies that relieve colic so speedily when given the second or third time do not produce so marked an effect.
You will find it necessary to hunt for an antipsoric, a remedy that will control the whole case. In the study of the colic alone during its attack you only get a one-sided view of the case, and after the colic is over (say he has been cured by Colocynth) you now study the patient and go over the case, and behold all the symptoms are covered by Kali carb. After giving that remedy you may expect that the patient will not have another attack.
Such is the nature of Kali carb. It is deep-acting, long-acting, goes deep into the life. It cures conditions due to psora, or to the suppression of eruptions in childhood, or to the closing up of old ulcers and fistulous openings with a history of troubles ever since. All these wandering pains and the chilliness are again relieved by eruptions, by the outbreak of discharges, by haemorrhages, by ulcers that eat in deep and flow freely and fistulous openings.
"Cutting in abdomen, as if torn to pieces."
"
"Violent cutting, must sit bent over pressing with both hands, or lean far back for relief; cannot sit upright. "Cutting and drawing like false labor pains."
There is great coldness with the pains, with the cutting in the abdomen; he wants heat, hot drinks, hot water bags. A chronic coldness is felt in the abdomen, cold externally and internally.
It would sometimes be cruel to give a dose of Kali carb. when the colic is on, because if the remedy fitted the case constitutionally, if all the symptoms of the case were those of Kali carb., you would be likely to get an aggravation that would be unnecessary.
There are plenty of short acting remedies that would relieve the pain speedily, and at the close of the attack the constitutional remedy could then be given. If the patient can bear the pain to the end, it is better to wait until it passes off without any medicine.
That sometimes is cruel, and then the short acting medicines should be given. All recurrent troubles, those that come periodically, or after eating certain articles, or from exposure, or with a periodicity that belongs to time - all these states are chronic; they are not acute troubles.
They are simply a small portion of a chronic miasm, a side view and all such cases must have a constitutional remedy sooner or later. You can, it is true, relieve violent pain at the first visit, but then you must look deeper and prevent your patient having more trouble.
Otherwise, if you should give Bell. or Colocynth or any medicine that simply fits the colic, the trouble will come back again; you have not cured your patient; you have only palliated. But, on the other hand, you take such a colic as is described here and Kali carb. fits just these symptoms alone and does not fit the whole constitution of the patient.
Then it is that a constitutional and long-acting remedy like Kali carb. acts in fullness. It does not take the usual long time to act and is not attended with an aggravation.
"Abdominal muscles painful to touch; swelling of glands."
In the abdomen, also following troubles in the bowels, or following peritonitis, we have effusion into the peritoneal sac, which is usually associated with dropsy of the extremities, but not always. In liver dropsies especially is that remedy useful.
Rectum: It has a great many complaints of the rectum and anus and of the stool.
It has most persistent and enormous hemorrhoidal tumors that burn, that are extremely sensitive to touch, that bleed copiously, that are extremely painful, making it impossible for him to sleep. He is compelled to lie upon the back and hold the nates apart, because the pressure is very painful to the external piles.
The piles cannot be put back; there is great distension and swelling inside. Haemorrhoids that come out after stool and bleed copiously and are very painful; they must be pushed back, and long after going to bed they burn like fire.
There is great aggravation from stool, which is hard and knotty and requires great straining to expel. Fistulae of the anus. Burning temporarily relieved by sitting in cold water.
It has chronic diarrhoea and also diarrhea alternating with constipation. Many times where there are numerous particulars, we have to rely upon the generals that are characteristic of the remedy. The text gives much less of diarrhea than has been developed by clinical uses.
"Diarrhoea painless, with rumbling in the abdomen and burning at stool, only by day; chronic cases with puffiness under the eyebrows."
It gives few symptoms, but it is a large and extensive remedy in diarrheas that are chronic. In old, broken down subjects, in weakly, pallid subjects, with poor digestion, with great flatulence, with much distension, with disordered liver.
Kidneys, Bladder: Then the kidney, bladder and urethra come in for their share of trouble, which is of a catarrhal nature.
Discharges from the bladder, purulent discharges of a thick, tenacious, copious mucus deposited in the urine. In keeping with this there is much burning; burning in the urethra, during and after micturition.
"Urine flows slowly with soreness and burning.”
Kali carb. runs very close to Natr. mur. in many of its old, long-standing bladder troubles, In old cases of gleet and long-standing cases of urinary troubles that follow gonorrhea these two medicines are useful, both suitable in the scanty, white, gleety discharge that remains. In both the urination is painful.
In Nat. mur. the burning is after urination. Where there is scanty, gleety discharge and the burning is very marked and only after urination, and the patient is extremely nervous and fidgety, Natrum mur. will cure.
If the burning is during and after urination and you have the broken down constitution we have described then the remedy may be Kali carb. Some of these old cases are entirely painless, having no pain either during or after micturition.
Then you get an entirely different class of remedies. The old chronic discharges following a gonorrhoea are as troublesome for the young doctor as anything that will ever fall into his hands. The remedies are numerous, the symptoms are scanty, and many times the patient has not been long under the doctor's care, therefore he does not know the patient's constitutional state well and the patient can only tell him of the discharge.
"Nothing but the discharge, doctor."
You cannot get his mind on his symptoms; he has forgotten that he wakes at 3 o'clock in the morning and cannot get to sleep until 5 o'clock, he has forgotten all the nervous manifestations. With the patient you have had under control, whose constitutional state you get before this condition comes, you ought not to have much difficulty.
One of the evidences that the Kali carb. patient is of a weakly constitution and is on the road to a break- down is that all of his symptoms are aroused and brought into action after coition, after sexual excitement. Now you will take notice in practice and remember it, that coition is a natural thing with man, when it is
carried on in order, and when that which is natural is followed by prostration, and this has been so for a long time, there is a break in the constitution, there is something radically wrong.
Genitals: All the symptoms are likely to be worse after coition in Kali carb. He has weak vision, weakness of the senses, tremulousness, and is generally nervous; he is sleepless, and weak, and he shivers and trembles for a day or two after coition.
Similar symptoms are observed in the woman. In spite of the fact that the patient is weak, the sexual desire is excessive. It is not orderly. There is a sexual erethism, which is not under the command of the will, and in the male he is subject to copious and frequent pollutions, nightly dreams, sexual prostration. Young men who have abused themselves, or who have indulged excessively in sexual pleasure, go into marriage with weakened genitals, incapacitated; and then there comes a disgust, and it is not strange that there are so many divorces in the world. When the patient is young, some of this trouble can be overcome by living an orderly life and correct Homeopathy.
In Kali carb. there are many complaints affecting the male genital organs; uneasiness and sensitiveness of the testicles. One is in a state of swelling and hardness. Itching and smarting and annoying sensations in the scrotum and sensations that constantly remind the patient that he has genital organs. Constant irritation calling his attention to the genitals, brought on from abuse, from vice, from excesses. Phosphorus is a medicine that is abused in this sphere. Many physicians look upon it as one of the great remedies for the weakness of the genital organs.
In Phos. the genital indications are extreme excitement, too active erections, a disorderly strength of the genital organs. Beware of giving it in impotency or in weakness, as this is often associated with very feeble constitutions, and Phos. not only fails to cure, but seems to add to the weakness. It is a weakness that you will learn is a vital weakness. Phos. will set patients to running down more rapidly who are suffering from a vital weakness, who are always tired, simply weak, always prostrated and want to go to bed.
The female has a great friend in Kali carb. It is full of her complaints and has many symptoms likely to be found in a sick woman. It is useful in cases of uterine hemorrhages that have been incessant in pale, waxy, hemorrhagic women; incessant haemorrhage following an abortion.
She has been curetted and has had all sorts of treatment, but still that oozing keeps right on. At the menstrual period the flow is very copious and clotted, and then after prolonged menstruation of ten days or so, during which she has had a copious flow, she settles back into a state of oozing and flowing until next month and then it rouses, up into another ten days of copious menstruation. Kali carb. has cured a number of cases of fibroid tumor long before it was time for the critical period to cure.
You must remember that there is natural tendency for a fibroid to cease to grow at the climacteric period, and afterwards to shrivel and that this takes place without any treatment, but the appropriate remedies will cause that haemorrhage to cease, will cause that tumor to cease to grow and after a few days there will bea grand shrinkage, in its size.
Pregnancy: Kali carb. is often a remedy for vomiting in pregnancy, but find out when it is the remedy for vomiting of pregnancy we ha to go to the whole constitutional state.
Vomiting of pregnancy is not cured, although it may be temporarily relieved, by Ipeca, as this is a medicine that corresponds merely to the nausea its. In a large number of instances gagging and nausea are only a second or third grade symptom in the remedy that will cure. The condition really depends upon the constitutional state, and the remedy th is to cure must be a constitutional remedy. Sulphur, Sepia and Kali carb. are among the remedies commonly indicated.
Sometimes Arsen is needed. Of course, if a pregnant woman has simply disordered her stomach and has vomited bile a few times the remedy might be Ipeca. When a pregnant woman has no constitutional symptom at all, and upon examining the case you find nothing but the nausea, overwhelming deathly nausea, with continuous vomiting day an night, a single dose of Symphoricarpus rac. will help.
That is prescribing upon very limited information, and should only be done in circumscribed or one-sided cases. It is not a long acting remedy, it is not a constitutional remedy and acts very much like Ipecac.
At times you will go into the confinement room when the woman has pains in the back below the waist line. The pains in the uterus are very weak, they are not sufficiently expulsive to make progress in the labor, the kind of pain that makes the woman utter the cry,
"My back, my back!"
The pains extend down the buttocks and legs. Pain in the back as if the back would break. Under good prescribing these pains are changed into contractions, which prove sufficient to expel the contents of the uterus.
When you hear such things you will look back over the history of the case. You will look back for weeks as th woman has been drawing near the end of gestation and see that the vague things, the chilliness and other features in her constitutional state for which you have been trying to find a remedy now culminate at the time of her confinement into a class of pain. Had you seen that six weeks before and given her Kali carb. you would have prevented the severe labor.
It is a severe labor, a prolonged labor; the uterus appears to be weak, and the pains are feeble they are all in the back, and do not go to the centre of operation as they should. Now, this same kind of a pain may deceive you in taking another form. The pains begin in the back, and appear to go to the uterus and then run up the back, which would turn you aside entirely from the Kali carb. pain into a pain that would indicate Gelsemium.
Sometimes these pains are so severe that they actually seem to prevent rather than encourage the contractions of the uterus; when the contractions of the uterus cease, and the woman screams out and wants her hips rubbed, and screams out with pain in each side of the abdomen rather than in the centre, pains in the region where the broad ligaments ought to be, Actea racemosa will make the pains regular.
Puls. is the medicine for absence of marked contraction, in cases inclined to do nothing; in a case that is inactive when the os is sufficiently dilated and the parts relaxed, and the prediction is an easy and simple labor, but the patient does not do anything. It is a state of mildness or inactivity. Puls. will very often cause in five minutes a very strong contraction of the uterus, sometimes almost, in a painless way.
"The back aches so badly while she is walking that she feels as if she could lie down on the street," etc..
The pain seems to take the force and vigor all out of the patient. After delivery there is a tendency to prolong the flooding, rousing up at every menstrual period, as described.
Heart: Weakness of the heart, cardiac dyspnea; the breath is short and the patient cannot walk or must move very slowly.
It is the coming on of a fatty heart.
With the suffocation and dyspnoea the breathing is so short that the patient cannot stop to take a drink or eat; the breathing is rapid, not deep, but weak. Dyspnea with violent, irregular palpitation of the heart, throbbing that shakes the whole frame, pulsation that can be felt to the ends of the fingers and toes.
Violent pulsations; patient cannot lie on the left side; accompanied by stitching pain through the chest, and cough. In old asthmatic patients with weak pulse, with the same pulsations and palpitation and cannot lie down.
The only position it seems that be can find any comfort in is leaning forward, with his elbows resting upon a chair. The attack is violent and continuous, especially worse from 3 to 5 A.M., and worse from lying in bed. He is aroused at 3 o'clock in the morning with these asthmatic attacks. Asthmatic dyspnea, when the state is that of humid asthma or filling up of the chest with mucus, course rattling in the chest, loud rattling breathing.
In patients who always have rattling in the chest, rattling cough, stuffy breathing; with every rainy spell or misty spell, or in cold, foggy weather, the condition becomes that of a humid asthma; asthmatic breathing, with much weakness in the chest, worse from 3 to 5 in the morning. The patient is pale, sickly and anemic, and complains of stitching pains in the chest.
The cough: of this medicine is one of the most violent coughs of all the medicines in the Materia Medica. The whole frame is racked. The cough is incessant, attended with gagging and vomiting, comes on at 3 o'clock in the morning, a dry, hacking, hard, racking cough.
"Suffocative cough and choking cough at 5 A.M. Great dryness in the throat between 2 and 3 A.M."
Think of Kali carb. when, after troubles like measles, a catarrhal state is left behind, due to lack of reaction, the psoric sequelae. The cough following measles is very often a Kali carb. cough. Kali carb. Sulphur, Carbo veg. and Drosera are perhaps more frequently indicated than other medicines in such coughs as follow measles of pneumonia.
The expectoration is copious, very offensive, tenacious, lumpy, blood-streaked or like pus, thick yellow or yellowish-green. Very often it has a pungent, cheesy taste, strong taste, as of old cheese. Catarrh of the chest. Dry cough day and night, with vomiting of food and some phlegm, worse after eating and drinking and in the evening.
Pains: Nothing is more striking in Kali carb. than the wandering stitching, pains through the chest, and the coldness of the chest.
The great dyspnoea, the transient stitches, the pleural stitches are important features of this remedy. A great number of the cases in which Kali carb. is suitable are those where the trouble has spread from catarrhal origin and from the lower portion of the lungs upwards. It is not so commonly indicated in those cases where the dullness has begun at the apex of either or both lungs.
It will very often ward off future sickness where the family history is tuberculous. Do not be afraid to give the antipsoric remedies when there is a history of tuberculosis in the family, but be careful when the patient
is so far advanced with tuberculosis that there are cavities in the lung, or latent tubercles, or encysted caseous tubercles.
Your antipsorics might rouse him into a dangerous condition. Do not suppose, however, that it is dangerous to give Sulphur because one’s father and mother have died of phthisis. Sulphur might be just the remedy to prevent the child from following the father and mother.
Kali carb. is often suitable, and will act as ail acute remedy in the advanced stages of phthisis in cases in which it was not indicated primarily as a constitutional remedy. In such instances it will act as a palliative in phthisis, whereas if it were indicated primarily as a constitutional remedy it would do damage in the last weeks.
The fortunate thing is that a great many homeopaths are not able to find the homoeopathic remedy. If the patient has yet lung space enough to be cured, Kali carb. will do wonders where the symptoms agree.
Gout: I want to warn you in one respect concerning Kali carb. It is a very dangerous medicine in gout. When you get an old gouty subject who has big toe joints and finger joints, and they are sore and inflamed every now and then, you might think that Kali carb. covers the case very suitably; he is disturbed in just such weather, he is pallid and sickly, his complaints come on at 2 to 3 o'clock in the morning, he has the shooting pains.
But these gouty patients are often incurable, and, if so, to undertake to cure them, would be a dreadful calamity, because the aggravations would last so long. If you give Kali carb. to one of these incurable patients in very high potency it will make your patient worse, and the aggravation will be serious and prolonged, but the 30 th may be of great service. Kali iod., when it is indicated in the gouty state, acts as a soothing and palliative remedy.
But Kali carb. seems to be a dreadful medicine to handle, it is a sharp and a two-edged sword. Do not undertake to give medicine with a view to curing these old cases of gout when the nodosities are numerous. Do not give that constitutional medicine that should have been administered to these patients twenty years ago, because there is not reaction enough in the life of the patient to turn him into order, and he will be destroyed. It seems paradoxical to say it, but to cure him is to kill him.
The vital action that is necessary to restore him to health would practically tear his framework to pieces. You need not believe these things, you are not obliged to. But think about them, and some day after practicing awhile and making numerous mistakes in attempting to cure incurables you will admit the awful power of homeopathic medicines.
They are simply dreadful. In old gouty cases, in old cases of Bright's disease, in advanced cases of phthisis where there are many tubercles, beware of Kali carb. given too high.
While studying the text book, look over the sensations. They are very numerous. Of course, those most striking are the stitching, and tearing pains, shooting, sticking and wandering pains.
Kalium Iodatum
This remedy is an antipsoric and antisyphilitic. It has been used very extensively by the old school as an antisyphilitic, but in the very large doses which they used it became to a great extent allopathic to the
disease, because of the tremendous effect it produced upon the economy, and implanted its own miasm, and thereby in a measure it suppressed many cases of syphilis.
The medicines that are the most powerful substances are really those that sustain in homoeopathic relation to the disease in general, and of these the very smallest dose often cure when similar. When the remedy is not similar enough to cure in such a form the increasing of the dose does not make it homoeopathic. There is an idea in vogue that increasing the dose makes the remedy similar. That is going away from principle. If the remedy is not similar there is no form of dose that can make it similar.
It affects the glandular structures and the periosteum after the manner of syphilis. It produces catarrhal inflammations. It is a deep-acting medicine and closely related to Mercurius. It has ulcerations and catarrhal states and glandular affections like Mercurius. It is similar in its action to Mercurius and is an antidote to it.
The old subjects who have always been taking Calomel or Blue Mass for their bilious complaints will in time become subject to frequent coryzas, constipation, pains and aches, and disturbance of the liver, and disordered stomach, and must have another dose of Mercury. Some of these cases need this remedy. If you practice medicine in a neighborhood where there is a very poor homeopath you will find that he is giving the Biniodide, or some other preparation of Mercury, for almost all of the colds or sore throats.
This establishes upon all of these patients an over-susceptibility to the weather changes, and they keep taking these red mercurial powders. Some of them carry them around in their pockets. But the more they take of these red powders the more frequently they have sore throats and colds. Many times they will not get over these troubles without Kali iod. in potentized form, or Hepar.
Hepar and Kali iod. are the two principal medicines that such patients need. Individuals with this susceptibility to colds and sore throats and weather changes, that is, from the effects of Mercury, who have been led into a Mercurial state, run two ways,
Those who are invariably shivering and cold, and want to hover around the fire, and cannot keep warm, will need Hepar, and those that are always too warm, that want the covers off, and want to be in constant motion, extreme restlessness, very tired when keeping still, will have their Mercury antidoted by Kali iod.
The Mercurial state will be antidoted, but it sometimes takes several prescriptions and sometimes a series of carefully selected remedies. The psora, that is, his chronic state, will not manifest itself until you have lifted off this miasmatic state, which has been caused by Mercurius. It is astonishing what a great number of men, women and children are bowed down by the miasm that Mercury produces, and yet those prescribers go on, giving this form of Mercury and say it is practicing Homoeopathy. I am led to remark that there is yet much to be learned about the art of prescribing.
Mind: This remedy has a peculiar mental state.
There is a very strong degree of irritability, cruelty, and harshness of temper. He is harsh with his family and with his children; abusive. It will take all the sense of refinement out of his mind and then he will become sad and tearful.
Extremely nervous, and must walk and be on the go. If he remains in a warm room he becomes weak and tired, and feels as if he could not stir, does not want to move, and does not know what is the matter with him.
He is worse in the warmth of the house, but as soon as he goes into the open air he feels better, and as soon as be begins to walk he feels still better and can walk long distances without fatigue; goes into the house again and becomes weak and tired and exhausted.
A nervous and mental exhaustion comes on from resting.
The head: manifests some peculiar things, such as we sometimes see in syphilis, which the remedy controls when the other symptoms agree.
Bi-parietal head pains of nerve syphilis, old, long standing cases. Pains through the parietal bones, through the side of the head, as if crushed in a vise; awful crushing, pulsating, pressing, rending pains on both sides of the head.
These are worse in the house, and better from warmth and from motion, better walking in the open air. All through the head there are pains like knife stabs, like nails driven in; lancinating pains, cutting pains in the scalp, in the temples, over the eyes through the eyes. The pericranium becomes sensitive and filled with nodules. The scalp breaks out with nodular eruptions, tuberculous eruptions, syphilitic eruptions.
"Scalp painful on scratching as if ulcerated." "Great disposition for hair to change color and fall out."
Coldness of the painful parts.
Eyes: In watching a syphilitic case, there is often noticed disturbance of vision, and finally iritis. They can be treated homeopathically. I have seen syphilitic iritis of the most severe character cured with Staphysagria, Hepar, Nitric acid, Mercurius, Kali iod, and many other remedies. The inflammatory process stops at once, there are no adhesions, no deformity, and no troubles remaining behind.
If you consider that a case of inflammation must run its course, and will be associated with fibrinous exudations, and adhesions most probably follow, of course you must adopt the plan of dilating with Atropine, and hold the iris so until the disease has run its course. But the disease does not run its course after a proper remedy, and as that is the last symptom to appear, it will be the first to go, and you may expect the eye symptoms to disappear within twenty-four hours after the administration of the homeopathic remedy.
This remedy has marked conjunctival trouble, with green catarrhal discharges from the eyes. This green character applies whenever you can find discharges. There is copious, thick, green expectoration, green discharges of muco-pus from the nose, from the eyes, from the ear, thick, greenish leucorrhoea, green discharge from ulcers. These thick green or yellowish-green discharges are sometimes very foetid.
At times when you examine the conjunctiva it seems to puff out as though water were behind it, a chemosis.
Iodide of potash, produces that state. "Chemosis, purulent secretion."
In olden times when I used to give Iodide of potash to rheumatic patients, according to the prevailing craze, I would notice, after a day or two, chemosis coming into the eyes and the patient beginning to ache in his
bones all over, while the rheumatism of the joints would disappear. An allopathic effect was taking root upon that patient which would last for years. I have noticed that a large dose of Kali iod. in syphilitics would make the patient get up the next morning with difficulty in opening the lids, and upon opening the eyes the conjunctiva would form water bags, as though water were behind them and they were bagged out.
Kali iod. also produces oedema of the lids and injection and tumefaction of the conjunctiva. The mucous membrane becomes red, raw and bleeding. The vessels are enlarged and the surface is very sore, inflamed and smarting. He is compelled to hold the eyelids during winking; the winking is painful and causes scratching, as from sand. Acute conjunctivitis, especially when it occurs in patients who have rheumatism, who have been abused with Mercury, or those afflicted with syphilis. Syphilitic and rheumatic affections of the eye.
Old gouty subjects who must keep in motion, and must keep in the open air, who are always too warm, and cannot endure any degree of warmth in the room, who suffer more from their gouty pains when keeping quiet, those who are fatigued when keeping quiet and can walk and move without fatigue in the open air, especially when it is cold, with enlarged joints, with restlessness, anxiety, nervousness, harshness of the temper and great irritability, alternating with weeping.
This relief from motion will make the routinist give Rhus in many instances, but Rhus would have no relation to the case whatever. Remember, Rhus is a cold patient, who is always shivering and wants to be by the fire, whose complaints are > by the heat, he is > in a warm room and becomes fatigued from motion, whereas Kali iod. does not become fatigued from continued motion.
The nose: comes in for much trouble.
In old syphilitic catarrhs they blow out great crusts and pieces of bone; syphilitic ozoena; the bones of the nose are very sensitive to touch and become necrosed, and the nose flattens down and becomes soft. It is deprived of the bony framework that holds it in shape and settles down flat, leaving only the red tip. Extreme pain at the root of the nose like Hepar.
Thick, yellowish-green, copious discharge from the nose. Every change of the weather brings on catarrhal states. He is constantly taking cold, sneezing continuously. Copious, watery discharge from the nose, excoriating the passage, and causing burning in the nose. This coryza is < in the open air, but all the rest of the patient is > in the open air.
Consequently, when a patient has two such conditions that operate against each other he suffers much, because he cannot find quarters for relief. Ina warm room his nasal catarrh, or his coryza, is >, but in the open air he feels > as to the rest of his complaints.
"Repeated attacks of violent, acrid coryza from the least cold."
With the coryza the frontal sinuses become involved, and there is great pain through the forehead; pain in the eyes, pains through the cheek-bones.
Throat: In the throat, as you might suppose from its relations to syphilis and Mercury, there is much trouble.
Deep ulcers in the throat, old syphilitic ulcers; perforating ulcers, eating away and destroying all the soft tissues, the uvula and the soft palate. Ulceration upon the tonsils; enlarged tonsils; very painful sore throat. Knots and knobs in the throat upon the mucous membranes.
"Dryness of throat and enlarged tonsils." "Terrible pain at the root of the tongue at night."
The whole pharynx, larynx, trachea and bronchial tubes suffer from catarrhal conditions. Inflammatory conditions with greenish discharge.
While all the external symptoms and the rest of the body symptoms are relieved in the cold air and by the contact of external cold, internally cold things aggravate. Cold milk, ice cream, ice water, cold drinks and cold food, cold things in the stomach < all the symptoms. Though he has an excessive thirst and will drink large quantities of water, if very cold it will make him sick.
Kali iod. has all the flatulence and belching of Carbo veg. and Lycopodium.
The glands all over the body become tumid, enlarged and hard. It has cured enlargement of the thyroid gland; it may take this from Iodine.
Very characteristic is the chronic inflammation of the urethra, following gonorrhoea, where the discharge is thick and green, or greenish yellow, without pain. Inflammation of the testicles, syphilitic in character.
Pain and rawness in the larynx, with hoarseness; awakens from constriction of the larynx. It is very useful in phthisis of the larynx. Cough from constant irritation in the larynx. Dry, hacking cough, hoarse cough with copious greenish expectoration. Catarrhal phthisis with thick, copious, greenish expectoration. Pleuritic effusion. Fluttering of the heart. Palpitation on slight exertion or when walking. Rapid pulse.
Not only in old gouty troubles, but in patients threatening phthisis, and in old malarial troubles this medicine will be of great service.
It cures sciatica when the pain is sharp from the hip down, worse lying, sitting or standing and better walking.
You may go to the bedside of a patient who is suffering from what she calls "hives;” you will find she is covered from head to foot with an eruption that forms great nodules; she is fairly burning up from head to foot. She cannot endure any covering; the heat of her body is intense, yet she has no rise of temperature.
Rough nodular manifestations all over the skin; a condition that will go away in a few hours, but in a few days, weeks or months come back again. A single dose of a very high potency of Kali iod. will turn things into order in persons subject to these hives and they will not come again.
Kalium Phosphoricum
Generals: The symptoms of this remedy are worse morning, evening and during the night.
The over-sensitive, nervous, delicate person, worn out from long suffering, much sorrow and vexation, and prolonged mental work; also such as are broken down from sexual excesses and vices.

Kalium Sulphuricum
Two very deep acting remedies unite to form this one. It was left to Schtiessler to show its first curative powers.
Dewey's work, on the "Tissue Remedies" gives the best presentation from the biochemic view. The writer gathered the symptoms from reported cures for many years, and found that they were justified by the study of the two remedies entering into the formation.
Generals: Many of these symptoms come out upon the sick as aggravations. Some of these are only cured symptoms. This arrangement could be improved upon much by provings. If the reader will carefully use this remedy as herein directed he will be astonished at its depth of action, and if he uses it high he will be surprised at the length of action of every dose.
It has cured epilepsy, lupus and epithelioma, and many desquamating skin affections. It has cured most obstinate case of chronic intermittent fever. It is useful in catarrhal affections with thick yellow or greenish pus, viscid or thin yellow watery discharges.
Most symptoms are aggravated in the evening. The patient craves fresh and even cold air, and he is ameliorated in open air and cool air. Aggravation by exertion and becoming heated. Complaints come on during rest, and are ameliorated by motion. Complaints aggravated in warm room. Takes cold from being overheated.

Jerking of the limbs and twitching of muscles. Dropsical condition of the extremities. Loss of flesh, and complaints aggravated after eating. Fasting ameliorates many symptoms. Flabby muscles.

Trembling and quivering. Walking ameliorates. Warm coverings aggravate, warm room aggravate, warm bed aggravates, warm wraps aggravate; bathing aggravates. Complaints dating back to suppressed eruptions. Post scarlatinal nephritis. One does not need to reflect to perceive this is Pulsatilla somewhat intensified. It takes up the work and finishes as a complement of Pulsatilla, unless, as in some instances, the patient becomes a cold and chilly subject and is better during rest, and then Silicea often will be found to have what symptoms remain.
It is usual for a patient under a deep acting remedy to go to opposite modalities, and hence Puls. is so often followed by Silicea; but this is not always true. When Puls. has acted well for a time and because of opposite modalities Silicea does good work for a while, and then the patient swings back to the original state, symptoms and modalities, then it is that Kali sulph. is of great usefulness.
What occurs is the same as when Sulph., Calc. and Lyc, have rotated in a given case too deep to be cured by a single remedy and a series of remedies has been what was required because the symptoms changed in such a manner that such a series was homeopathically suited.

Kalmia Latifolia
Generals: The symptoms that indicate this remedy show themselves especially in the muscles, in the tendons, in the joints, along the course of the nerves, in rheumatic complaints.
Pains: The pains change about, wandering pains, and they axe aggravated from motion. The sharp pains spread from the centres to the extremities, the wandering pains go downwards, down the arms, down the back and down the legs; from the shoulder to the fingers, and from the hips to the toes.
These pains sometimes shoot like lightning, again they tear along the nerves, along the sciatic and crural nerves, down through the calves. In rheumatic constitutions the pains are dull, tearing, crushing and
pressing, and are aggravated by motion and go from the lower to the upper limbs. Motion will bring on the pain or aggravate it when it is present. The head pains are very severe. They often begin in the back of the neck or back of the head, and extend to the top of the head. There are also pains in the front of the head, pains over one or both eyes, tearing neuralgic pains aggravated by heat and motion.
Pains come and go with the sun, that is, they begin in the morning at the rising of the sun and increase till noon, then gradually decline and disappear at sunset. He is incapacitated for mental work when in motion and even when sitting up, but, when lying upon his back perfectly quiet, making no motion, the mind works well and with clearness; with the slightest motion, however, even of the hand, on comes vertigo and confusion of mind.
Moving about disturbs makes him incompetent. The pains are also worse the first half of the night. With these symptoms there is cardiac trouble of rheumatic origin. The condition has increased until organic disease has come, even hypertrophy of the heart and valves.
Heart: This remedy has cured that state. Palpitation very marked when lying on the left side, > when lying on the back, sometimes > when sitting erect, < when bending forward.
These symptoms alone cause this remedy to stand out in relief. It is useful in rheumatic patients where syphilis is at the bottom, syphilitic rheumatism that has taken the course described until finally the heart has become affected and there is thickening of the valves. Shooting pains through the heart, pains in the chest, intermittent pulse, pulse skipping a beat now and then.
Either the arterial or venous system, or the valves of the heart, or both, may be affected. Dyspnoea from any kind of exercise, cardiac dyspnoea. You have in this a remedy for such complaints. It goes to the bottom in old cases of rheumatic syphilis, and has cured many a cardiac complaint that was the result of syphilis.
You will be guided to it especially if the pains wander from place to place, and if they go from above down wards, if they go from the shoulder down toward the fingers, from the hips toward the feet, or down the spine. It is also suitable in old cases of gonorrhoeal rheumatism when the symptoms agree.
The slightest motion, the slightest effort or exertion brings on the vertigo, and this is due to disturbance of the circulation. The heart is so susceptible to any exertion that disturbance of the circulation of the blood in the brain comes on from the slightest motion.
"In a recumbent posture mental faculties and memory perfect, but, on attempting to move, vertigo."
If the patient persists in moving, nausea and vomiting will follow. It has palpitation, shaking the whole frame, audible, vehement palpitation. He cannot lie on his left side.
It is suitable in old, troublesome, recurrent headaches associated with cardiac affections. A headache will come on daily if the sun comes out, but it will not come on if the day is clouded. He is aggravated from the light of the sun and the increasing brightness of the sun's rays.
In addition to these there are paroxysms of pain that are nightly. These are the bone pains, pains in the shin bones as if the periosteum would be torn off; these pains come on at night, or the first half of the night. It is well known in syphilis that the < is at night. It is an antipsoric, antisycotic and antisyphilitic, it can be selected when the symptoms agree with any of the three miasms. Pains in the pericranium, pains in the bones nearest to the surface. In bed at night the pains become very severe and last all night.
This night aggravation, is especially true of the marked antisyphilitic medicines. It is found under Hepar and Mercurius; but in none of the remedies do we find it so strikingly manifested as in the disease, or miasm, syphilis itself.
In syphilis the < comes with the setting of the sun. It is one of man’s enemies that does its work in the night. Many of the complaints of sycosis conform to the day hours, and the pains are < from the rising. to the going down of the sun.
Medicines also have such I queer whims. We must study remedies as we would human character. Some of them seem to be extremely whimsical, and it is by knewing these whimsical, strange and peculiar things that we are able to mark the character of the remedy, When we know these peculiari ties we have found the circumstance under which the remedy Works
Kidneys: There are kidney affections.
All the organs are related. to each other but especially the heart and kidneys. When the kidneys are not working well, the heart is very often troublesome. All through the varying forms of Bright’s disease the heart is troublesome.
Difficulties of breathing, difficult heart action, with albuminuria. It will relieve the breathing. Again, associated with kidney affections, we have many eye complaints, difficulties of vision, and these also especially call for this remedy. It is often indicated in Bright's disease, with disturbance of vision, occurring during pregnancy.
Pains: For the pains in the eyes, the stitching, tearing pains that occur during kidney disturbance in pregnancy, or during albuminuria, Kalmia becomes a remedy,
This remedy is useful in neuralgia; neuralgia of the eye, neuralgia of the face, violent, tearing pains in the face. Sometimes it takes the form of a nightly < and sometimes it takes the form of daily <. The aggravation in the daytime comes and goes with the sun. The < at night time comes with the lying down.
"Anxious expression of countenance" associated with rheumatism of the heart. "Flushing of the face, with vertigo."
After the disappearance of a herpetic eruption, violent neuralgic pains, shooting, tearing pains in those nerves that supply the part where the eruption was. When shingles, ring-worm, cold sore, or isolated vesicular eruptions disappear, suddenly from some violent cause or inappropriate treatment, or from catching cold, violent neuralgias come in their place and continue until the eruption comes out again.
This remedy becomes suitable if the symptoms agree; that is, if the whole patient is in agreement with the state of the remedy.
The pains are stitching and tearing, very severe, sometimes cutting and shooting when this remedy is mw useful. The pain will seem to take hold of a nerve and will hold on to it for many minutes, Coming with violence, coming suddenly and letting loose suddenly. Pains come in the extremities in the same way, taking hold as if the nerve were being pinched by nippers, or as if it were being torn to pieces.
"There, now it is gone!" says the patient.
Pretty soon, again, you will see his face in a state of horrible distress. The pain is there again and he cannot move a muscle, and "there, it is gone!" he says, and it remains away for some minutes and sometimes for hours.
Heart: The heart has many symptoms which should be studied. "Fluttering of the heart, palpitation of the heart." "Palpitation up into the throat, after going to bed, trembling all over."
Very slow pulse. I remember a patient, an old syphilitic, who was told if he ever made a violent move he would die, the valves of his heart were so badly affected. He had all the murmurs that it seemed possible from the heart valves.
He had traveled all over and had taken large doses of Mercury, and his syphilitic condition had to a great extent been suppressed, until finally the whole trouble had located in the heart. Kalmia removed all the dyspnea and palpitation in a few months, and it was nearly two years before there was a marked return of the symptoms and a repetition put him in a state of health, so that be needed no more medicine.
This shows what a deep-acting remedy Kalmia is, how long it may act, what wonderful changes it may effect. A remedy must be capable of going deep into the life to do such things.
"Wandering rheumatic pains in the region of the heart." "When articular rheumatism has been treated externally and cardiac symptoms ensue."
Rheumatism that goes from the lower to the upper limbs. Not uncommonly you will meet such things. These "rubbers" that go around the streets with a strong liniment and considerable magnetism frequently do cause a rheumatism to leave the knee joint, and when it does that, the heart is likely to be the organ that suffers.
Then Kalmia, Aurum, Bryonia, Rhus tox., Ledum, Calc. and Abrotanum, and sometimes Cactus, are remedies that prove suitable for such cardiac affections. Rheumatic affections that are driven away in this manner are changed without being cured. The people cannot realize the danger, of merely removing symptoms. Every removal that is not in accordance with cure affects the centres of man, that is the heart and brain.
Rubbing is a dangerous thing. When you are importuned with the question,
"Doctor, will it hurt me to have this rubbed?" you reply, "If rubbing does not affect any change in the symptoms, it will do no harm."
In proportion as it mitigates the symptoms or relieves, just in that proportion it does the patient harm, for the whole vital economy is weakened. There are instances where rubbing is of benefit, but not in rheumatism.
In paralyzed muscles it is a beneficial exercise, for then rubbing can take the place of exercise of the patient himself, of the muscles. But rubbing is not admissible if it is used to reduce pain. The more agreeable it is, the worse, it is for the patient.
In a Phosphorus patient you would be astonished what wonderful relief they can get from rubbing. There is no person more inclined to be weak in the vitality, in the internal economy, than the Phosphorus patient. He is an excitable, weakly patient, and feels better by rubbing and craves it, but if he has rheumatism in the knees and the knee is rubbed the rheumatism may go to the heart, The Phos. patient loves to be rubbed, because rubbing relieves the symptoms; he loves to be magnetized.
"Weariness of all the limbs; shuns all exertion." "Weakness the only general symptom with neuralgia."
This weakness is a state that you can glean something from. When severe pain is fatiguing the economy the heart is threatened. A general weakness, prolonged weakness after confinement, or from the pain, as we find in Hepar, but with the weakness, these pains are threatening to leave their parts and go to the heart. He is perfectly exhausted and continuously tired.
The text speaks only of Aconite and Belladonna as the antidotes. Spigelia follows this remedy very well and antidotes it. Benzoic acid is a natural complement to it. Calc., Lith. carb., Lyc., Nat. mur., and Puls. are the remedies that are closely related and should be compared.
Kreosotum
Characteristics: There are three things that stand out most prominently in Kreosotum, and when they appear together the symptoms in minor degree will be likely to be associated.
These three characteristics are:
1. Excoriating discharges; 2. Pulsations all over the body, and 3. Profuse bleeding from small wounds.
When these three things arc associated in a high degree Kreosote should be examined. A prick of a pin will cause the oozing of bright red- blood, and mucous membranes bleed easily. Any pressure upon the mucous membranes will cause oozing.
Bleeding here and there about the body. The lachrymation is excoriating. It excoriates the margins of the lids and checks, and they become red and raw, and smart. If there is a purulent discharge it is acrid. The corners of the lips and mouth are red and raw, and' the saliva burns and smarts. The moisture about the mouth, whatever it may be, excoriates and the mouth is raw. The eyes smart and burn as if raw.
The leucorrhoea causes smarting and burning about the vulva, so that the mucous surfaces of the labia are red and raw, sometimes inflamed, but always burning. The vagina burns during coition, and there is bleeding after coition; granulations of the vagina and os uteri, so that the pressure of the act of coition brings on bleeding and burning, smarting and excoriation. And the male organ will smart and burn after coming in contact with the secretion of the vagina during coition.
The urine burns and smarts. This tendency to excoriation from the excretions and secretions applies to all the tissues of the body.
Every emotion and exciting circumstance is attended with throbbing all over the body, pulsations to the
ends of the fingers. Every emotion is attended with tearfulness, Music that will in the slightest way excite the emotion, minor strains and music that strikes home to the heart, pathetic music, will bring out tears
that are acrid, and palpitation and pulsations that are felt to the extremities.
When the Kreosote sore throat is present the least pressure of the tongue depressor will establish oozing, little drops of blood will appear. During the coryza there is nosebleed. When the eyes are red and raw and inflamed, they will bleed easily. If an individual pricks the finger the blood will not merely be a single drop, but a good many will flow. Prolonged haemorrhage from the passages; hemorrhage from the kidneys, from the eyes, the nose, the uterus. Haemorrhage after coition. Tumors bleed easily.
These are the most marked features of Kreosote. If these are fixed in your mind, we have what may be known, as a Kreosote constitution out of which may come all the rest of the symptoms in all their minutiae, and little symptoms and fragments in every organ. You have in this one group the strong features of Kreosote. No matter how many particulars you may have in a case, if you do not have something of these general features you need not expect to find your patient constitutionally cured or relieved by Kreosote. These may be considered essentials.
Mentally the patient is so irritable that there is nothing that will suit him. The wants are so numerous that nothing satisfies. The patient wants everything and is satisfied with nothing, that is, he wants something and when he has it he does not want it. That is the state of irritability and lack of satisfaction in a chronic condition.
You see the child in the mother's arms. It wants a toy, and when given it throws it in the face of somebody; it wants this and that and is never satisfied, always wanting something new, a new toy which it throws away the moment it gets it and then calls for something else.
The lips are red and bleeding, the corners of the month are raw, the eyelids red and the skin excoriated. If it has, in connection with all this, loose passages from the bowels and you examine the fissure between the nates, you will find it is red and raw. If the child be old enough to make such motions he will put the hands upon the sore genitals and fissures and cry out in a most irritable way, because of the smarting.
Such is the Kreosote baby. It may be suffering from cholera infantum; it may be subject to wetting the bed; it may have spells of vomiting, in which it vomits all its food; it is a Kreosote baby.
Kreosote has attacks of diarrhoea and vomiting; all sorts of disturbances of the urine; great distension and trouble with the bowels; abdomen distended from flatus. You look over the whole case at once as a Kreosote case, because of these general features that can be summed up in the aspect of the child.
The Kreosote face has a yellowish pallor; it is a sickly countenance, semi-cachectic, intermingled with blotches that are reddish looking, as if erysipelas were going to set in. In olden times this countenance was called a scorbutic countenance.
Take a woman with this kind of countenance; at every menstrual flow she complains of much swelling and rawness of the genitals; the flow is copious, clotted, stops and then starts again, comes too soon and lasts too long; at times it is black, very foetid, produces rawness upon the thighs and the genitals, with much swelling; at every menstrual period there is rawness of the lips and fissures in the corners of the mouth; the tears become acrid; at the menstrual period all the fluids of the body seem to be acid and they burn wherever they touch.
Very often there is a loose stool, which is also acrid and smarts the anus at the menstrual period. All the symptoms are worse at the menstrual period, sometimes in the early part, sometimes at the middle, sometimes all through, and sometimes at the close. Something more about the scorbutic constitution is brought out in relation to the gums; the gums become puffed and red and tumid and settle away from the teeth.
They become spongy and bleed easily. In the mouth there is much ulceration and little ulcers spread from aphthous patches, smarting and burning; the tongue has ulcers upon it, which bleed easily upon touch.
At the close of a typhoid fever haemorrhage from the bowels, bleeding from the mucous membranes. The mouth becomes raw, and wherever there is a mucous membrane there is a rawness, and the fluids that ooze continue to, eat and cause ulceration. If at the close of a typhoid fever, when the time comes for convalescence, vomiting comes.
Vomiting, bleedings, diarrheas. The fluids vomited from, the stomach are so acrid that they seem to take the skin off from the mouth, set the teeth on edge, make the lips raw. So excoriation from acrid fluids, as well as throbbing all over the body, are features that you must bear in mind with Kreosote.
The discharges from the body are offensive; offensive, bloody, acrid discharges from the nose; offensive, watery discharges from any part of the body; sometimes even putrid; the leucorrhea is very offensive. Rapid emaciation, with spongy, burning ulceration, pus acrid, ichorous, foetid and yellow. Sometimes the inflammatory condition will run so high in an ulcer, only a small ulceration, that gangrene will set in, and hence we have a gangrenous ulceration; gangrene of parts that are inflamed.
Very low formations occur upon the margins of mucous membranes; crusts form. Indurations under the crusts and the crusts continue to form.
The circulation is so poor, so feeble in the parts all about the margin of the lips and the corners of the mouth, and corners of the eyes, and eyelids, and upon the genitals, and there is so much venous engorgement that crusts form and ulcerate and bleed and pile up, and this continues until a phagedenic spot comes. This condition is so much like epithelioma that Kreosote has cured epithelioma.
Stomach: The next striking thing in Kreosote is its stomach symptoms, Soon after eating there comes a burning pain in the stomach, and then a sense of fullness and an increasing nausea, ending in vomiting of the food, which looks as it did when taken; it looks undigested, but it is sour and acrid, coming up an hour or two after eating. Vomiting, the stomach seems unable to digest, and after the patient empties it there is constant nausea. After a swallow of water a prolonged bitter taste remains in the mouth.
There is aggravation from eating cold things and relief from warm diet. In malignant diseases of the stomach when this symptom is present, Kreosote becomes a great palliative; it relieves the burning and improves the digestion for a while, but the trouble comes again. Many times our remedies furnish us the greatest known palliation in cancerous affections. Homoeopathy should at all times furnish a degree of palliation in cancerous and other incurable malignant diseases of the stomach.
This palliation will bring more comfort to the stomach than can possibly be brought about by Morphine. I have watched patients under Morphine and under homeopathic medicine, and as a mere matter of comfort I will take the homoeopathic medicines.
This has been the experience of many. When you hear a homoeopath say that he prefers anodynes in cancerous affections of the stomach and in other painful affections, it is pretty sure evidence that he is not able to find the medicines that are suitable for the patient. These cases test the ability of the physician.
Diarrhea: Kreosote is a great remedy for diarrheas in the summer, especially for infants. The infant that I described as to his temper may be the infant suffering from the worst form of summer complaint, or having a light attack of cholera infantum. Or he may be "teething," and suffering from the troubles that are sometimes associated with teething. Infants have troubles at the time of teething only because they are sick, and if the child were not in disorder he would not have trouble when teething. Teething is a crisis, and the things that are within will come out at the time, just as there are troubles that are likely to come out at the time of puberty and at the climacteric period.
A marked feature of the Kreosote constitution is that when the desire to urinate comes, he must hurry or the urine will escape. The urine is passed during sleep. Bloody urine; clots in the urine; acrid and excoriating urine; weakness of the bladder; inability to hold the urine.
Smarting and burning in the pudenda, during and after micturition. "Sugar in the urine."
It has cured diabetes. Generalize the symptoms given and you will see what kind of a diabetic patient will need Kreosote.
Lac Caninum
History: A beginning in this remedy was made by Dr Nisip and after Reisig it was used by Bayard.
After Bayard's death Dr. Dyer gave me a vial of the 30 th potency, made by Reisig, from which the potencies have mostly been made.
All the milks should be potentized, they are our most excellent remedies, they are animal products and foods of early animal life and therefore correspond to the beginning of our innermost physical nature.
If we had full provings of monkey's, cow's, mate's and human milk they would be of great value. Lac defloratum has done excellent work, and so has this remedy. Lac caninum is in its beginnings yet, although it has made some marvelous cures, but many of its symptoms axe doubtful and it would take a century to confirm them.
Some may think because the milk are only food for the young they are not medicine, but let one who is made sick from milk take it in potentized form and report the result. Provers who dislike milk will become sick from taking it in potencies in a few days, and their symptoms are very numerous.
Generalities: This remedy abounds in nervous symptoms, although it has no doubt tissue changes as well.
It is deep and long acting; the provers felt its symptoms for years after the proving was made.
The mental symptoms are prolonged and distressing. It has cured enlarged glands. It makes ulcers very red, and it has cured such ulcers. Ulcerated areas have a dry, glistening appearance as if coated with epithelium.
It is an important remedy in complaints following badly treated diphtheria, in paralysis and other conditions dating back to diphtheria. The greater number of its symptoms belong to the nervous system. An oversensitive state prevails, a general hyperesthesia of the skin and all parts. In makes women violently hysterical, and causes all sorts of strange and apparently impossible symptoms.
For example, a woman lay in bed for days with the fingers abducted and would go wild if they touched each other. The fingers were not aggravated from hard pressure, but she would scream, if they touched. This state is difficult to cure outside of Lac can. and Lach. Lach, has produced a similar condition. The sensitiveness of the abdomen so that the sheet cannot be permitted to touch the skin belongs to both.
Another strange state is a peculiar vertigo, a condition, when walking, in which she seems to be floating in mid-air, or, when lying, as it she were not on the bed. Other remedies have this. The sensation, as if floating, or not touching the bed, or sinking down, belongs to Lach. The sensation of gliding while walking is strong under Asarum Europaeum.
Alternates sides: The complaints, almost regardless of kind or quality, change sides.
The rheumatism is first found in one ankle and then in the other, and then back again to the original site. If in the knee or hip or shoulder the rheumatism alternates sides. The headaches and neuralgias do the same thing. The ambulating erysipelas first attacks one side, then the other. Inflammation and neuralgia of the ovaries the same alternation is observed. Sore throats affect alternately the sides of the throat or tonsils.
Many cases of this sort have been cured by this remedy. The trouble commenced on the right and went to the left and Lyc. failed, but when it returned to the right the alternation was noticed and the remedy revealed. Only a limited number of remedies have alternating sides.
Mind: One or two provers had many symptoms, and so not all are reliable; but this remedy so intensifies the imagination and senses that it would be easy for them to imagine symptoms, and that itself is suggestive. Full of imaginations and harassing, tormenting thoughts.
Wandering features in the mental sphere, wandering and alternating states. Cannot collect the thoughts. She wants to leave everything as soon as it is commenced, a condition of irresolution common to quite a number of remedies. She is impressed with the idea that all she says is not so, thinks everything she says is a lie, as if there is no reality in the things that be.
In this it is somewhat analogous to Alumina in which the patient feels as if someone else and not himself were saying everything, a lack of consciousness of the reality of things.
Every time a symptom appears she thinks it is a settled disease fear and anxiety that some horrible disease has come upon her, a delusion that she was suppurating and in a loathsome state; infested with makes.
Horrible sights are presented to the mental vision, nor always makes, and she fears the objects will take form and present themselves to her eyes. This is analogous to Lach., which has the feeling that the atmosphere is full of hovering spirits, although he never sees them.
Imagines he wears someone else's nose. Imagines she is not herself and her properties not her own. Imagines she sees spiders, snakes, vermin. She cannot bear to be alone. In Lach. the patient wants to be alone to indulge the strange fancies, and when alone she feels as if she were floating out of the window and over the grassy plains, but a sound will bring her back to the world again.
This is on the border-land of insanity or delirium.
Although the patient has all these strange feelings, yet she goes around all day about her business, and no one knows them unless she confesses them. Chronic sadness, everything so dark; irritable, ugly, hateful. Full of vertigo, but it is a sensorial symptom, unusually refined; not the vulgar swaying or tossing or feeling as if things were going round. It affects the whole body, as if she were swimming or floating in the air, spirit-like.
Head: The headaches are violent and are mostly frontal, but it has also, occipital headaches.
Headache above the eyes from riding in the cold wind, ameliorated in a warm room. Both the frontal and occipital headaches are aggravated by turning the eyeballs upwards and using the eyes for fine work. Pains in the head during the day, first on one side then on the other, either side being first affected. Pains in the face or eyes, alternating sides, perfectly unbearable, ameliorated going into the open air. The rheumatic symptoms are ameliorated by cold and cold applications, thus classifying it with Puls. and Led. Some headaches are noted as relieved by warmth.
Sensitiveness is marked; sensitive to light and noise. The page is not clear when reading. She sees faces before her in the dark. Old, troubled, distorted, disagreeable faces come to the vision or imagination. Dark, hideous faces she has seen come up, and she is tormented by them. This is not really a symptom of the vision, but a state of the brain.
Sounds seem far off. Paralysis of the throat with diphtheria; fluids return by the nose when drinking. Coryza, with sore throat and sneezing. Stuffed nose; discharge of thick white mucus. Faceache; pain aggravated by exertion, ameliorated by warm applications, but only cold applications relieve the soreness.
Mouth and throat: Putrid mouth is a strong feature.
The mucous membrane and teeth are coated with a fuzzy, shining, silvery substance, somewhat like milk. In the throat there is a felt-like exudation, ashy gray or silvery shiny deposit. It has been used in diphtheria for the class of cases taking alternate sides, and it has also cured paralysis following diphtheria.
The pain in the throat pushes toward the left ear. Pains take alternate sides. The throat is ameliorated by cold or warm drinks, and aggravated by empty swallowing. It is indicated especially in a glazed, shiny, red appearance of the throat like Kali bich.
The diphtheritic membrane is also white like silver. Lac c. has cured most alternating cases, with patches first on the right tonsil, then on the left. Membranous croup. Wherever there is mucous membrane there will be exudate, a gray, fuzzy coating, like that piling up on the tongue.
I once cured with Lac c. a chronic affection in which the whole buccal cavity had a white, exudate without inflammation or ulceration, an apparent infiltration which dipped down everywhere extending under the tongue. It was white and silvery, looking as if a mouthful of carbolic acid had been swallowed, and the mouth was so sensitive that the patient could not swallow anything but milk.
The abdomen is full of distress. Pressive pain in the pelvis; acute pain in left groin. Constant urging to urinate. Irritable bladder.
The female sexual organs furnish a mass of symptoms. Severe pain in the region of the right ovary, ameliorated by the flow of bright red blood, is again somewhat like Lach. These pains take alternate sides.
Zinc. also has pain in the ovaries ameliorated by the flow; she never feels well except when menstruating; hysterical at all other times but well at the menstrual period, is Zinc. Membranous dysmenorrhoea is another example of the exsudative tendency of Lac c. Sore throat beginning and ending with the menstrual period. Mag. carb. has sore throat before the menstrual period and Calc. c. has cured painful throat when menstruating.
Genitals: Escape of gas from the vagina.
The fermentation of mucus and other substances in the bladder causing the escape of gas when urinating is found only under Sars.; the urine flows with a loud noise. It is not uncommon for a child to break wind when urinating, and the urine is passed with a gurgling noise; this is cured by Sars.
Much trouble with the mammae; they feel as if they would suppurate. When a mother has lost her infant and it is necessary to dry up the milk, Lac. c. and Puls. are the best remedies for this purpose, when no symptoms are present. They will do it speedily. The Lac c . patient is imaginative and sensitive to pain and her surroundings, hyperesthesia and touchiness. Puls. will be called for in the Puls. constitution.
Rheumatism with swelling of the lower extremities, especially when it affects the limbs alternately; aggravated by motion and heat, ameliorated by cold. Pains in the limbs as if beaten. Rheumatic swellings of joints.
Lac Vaccinum Defloratum
The untrained mind naturally rebels at the idea of giving skimmed milk to sick people as a remedy, but when potentized like any other substance it becomes one of the most useful remedies.
Every physician has seen a few cases in his practice; men, women and children who cannot drink milk. They say they are made sick by drinking or using milk, and that milk is poison to them.
It is the work of the true physician to study cases and ascertain in each case what symptoms are observed after taking milk. These symptoms constitute a proving of it and it is the best kind of a proving as it is produced upon sensitive persons.
The writer has made it his duty to study each and every one of these cases until the image of the sickness produced by, milk has dawned upon him both from the individual symptoms and from a collective view.
Much can be learned by meditating upon the milk constitution some may think there is a difference of importance between milk skimmed and new milk, but for all practical purposes the skimmed milk is sufficient and cures the oversensitiveness to milk, if used in a high potency. It is useless in low potency.
It is a useful remedy as it may demonstrate to the unbeliever the wonderful power of the high potency. It has aggravation during the whole twenty-four hours; some cases manifest symptoms only during, the daytime, and amelioration comes with the going down of the sun - but this is uncommon.
The chronic milk subject is very cold and bloodless and cannot get warm even in a warm room and by warm clothing; she is so chilly and so sensitive to cold that she feels the air blowing on her in the room, as if she were fanned, even where there is no possible draft and others feel the room to be very warm.
She is very sensitive to wet weather. She is subject to neuralgic and rheumatic pains all over the body but more especially in the head. The pain in the head is better from cold, applications, but the pains elsewhere are better from heat. The sufferings are all worse by motion and better by rest; pains are better by pressure.
The bones are sore to touch. Great lassitude and even weakness, can endure no exertion. There is marked restlessness and she is unable to hold up after loss of sleep; extreme weariness from a short walk.
She looks and acts as though she had been suffering long or as if she were going into a decline. The skin all over the body is violently sensitive to cold objects and touch of cold sponge. There is marked periodicity in the nature of the remedy, most noticed in the recurrent headaches. This remedy has had a reputation for curing diabetes and this is not to be wondered at when it is known to have cured the weakness, anaemia and copious, watery urine and great thirst; also copious, dense urine.
Many invalids cured by this remedy have appeared to the writer much like the typical diabetic patient; but it can cure only where the peculiar symptoms agree. It will not cure simply when the common symptoms are present.
Let all observers faithfully and minutely study all patients who have an aversion to milk; all who have diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, sick headaches, eructations, foul stomach after drinking milk and in time the general idea of the milk sickness will be known.
It is a most useful and frequently needed remedy for infants and children who cannot take milk, not always as their specific remedy, but as one of the remedies that will help many infants to grow up some grow morbidly fat and others become lean when fed on milk.
It has been useful in dropsy from weak heart; from liver complaints and from suppressed malaria. People who drink milk habitually become anemic and catarrhal; fatty degeneration of muscles, of heart and liver. Malassimilation, is the most marked feature of milk poison.
The pains become violent in many parts; in the spinal cord; in eyeballs; in supra-orbital nerves; in forehead and through the head; in the stomach; in lower part of the abdomen. Many people are made sick by milk who use cream with safety and delight.
Lac defloratum is often the remedy for such patients and after a careful examination, their symptoms appear like the proving of skimmed milk.

Great soreness all over the head on jarring or coughing; sensation as if top of head was lifted off; pain first in the forehead extending to occiput, making her nearly frantic. Intense headache in forehead and through head, worse in vertex, afterwards head felt bruised.
With all the frontal headaches there is strong pulsation in temples. It has cured many violent, periodical, sick-headaches, that have been present since childhood and said to be inherited. During these violent headaches there is sometimes a sensation as though the head were expanding; it has cured headaches that come before and after menses. Morning sickness during pregnancy.

Lachesis
Lachesis is a frequently indicated remedy, and one that you will need to study much in order to know how to use. Lachesis seems to fit the whole human race, for the race is pretty well filled up with snake as to disposition and character and this venom only causes to appear that which is in man.
Generals: We will first give a survey or the general symptoms, those which characterize the remedy and are of greatest importance, and the circumstances under which the symptoms appear, are brought out or are aggravated.
One who is a constitutional Lachesis patient will find himself suffering from an aggravation of his symptoms in the Spring, when he goes out from the cold weather into the milder weather, and especially is that so if it mild and rainy, or cloudy weather. Or if he goes from a cold into a warmer climate the symptoms of Lachesis will come out. The warm south winds excite the Lachesis symptoms.
The symptoms of Lachesis are worse on entering sleep. He may have felt nothing of his symptoms when awake, but when sleep comes on they are aroused, and they gradually increase as the sleep is prolonged, so that a very long sleep will aggravate all the state and condition of a Lachesis patient, and when awakening from sleep he looks back on that sleep with sorrow.
The sleep has been disturbed by attacks of suffocation and by awful dreams, and now, after having slept a long time, he arouses with dreadful headaches, with palpitation, with melancholy, with sorrows from head to foot. His body is full of suffering and his mind sees no brightness in anything.
There is a cloudy state, sadness, melancholy, insane notions, whims, jealousy and suspicion. When taking a warm bath, or applying warm water to places that are inflamed, his mental symptoms are aggravated. After a warm bath or after getting warmed up, or, if he becomes chilled from being out on a cold day and then goes into a warm room, the symptoms come on. After going into a warm bath, palpitation comes on; it seems as if his head would burst, his feet become cold, and he is shocked all over, pulsation all over, or feeble heart. Fainting in a warm bath. Girls sometimes faint when going into a warm bath. The patient may be cold and chilly yet the warm room increases or brings out the symptoms.
The general aspect of the patient and the localities will point some times to Lachesis. Upon the face there is an appearance of anxiety, of unrest and distress. The face is spotted or purple and the eyes are engorged. The eyes look suspicious. If there is an inflamed spot, it is purple. If there is an inflamed gland, and Lachesis is full of inflammation of the glands and cellular tissues, there is a purple or mottled appearance.
If there is an ulceration the ulceration bleeds black blood, which soon coagulates and looks like charred straw. From the wounds there is much bleeding. Small wounds bleed much like Phosphorus and Kreosote. A prick of a pin will ooze great drops of blood. Ulcers eat in, have false granulations, are putrid, bleed easily, and the blood is black, and all round the ulceration there is a purple, mottled appearance, looking as if about to become gangrenous.
Often gangrene does come; gangrene of parts that have been injured. Sloughing with great offensiveness. The parts turn black and slough. The veins become varicose. These are found upon the limbs, having the appearance of the varicose veins that come after gestation. Enlargement of the veins is a prominent condition of Lachesis.
From the slightest exertion of the mind or from the slightest emotion the extremities become cold, the heart becomes very feeble, the skin is covered with sweat and the head is hot. Warmth does not seem to relieve the coldness of the feet and hands; they are so cold. They may be wrapped up in flannels and still they remain cold, but suffocation is brought on. He cannot breathe and wants the windows open. It is weakness of the heart; sometimes so weak that it can hardly be heard or felt, and the pulse is feeble and intermittent. At other times there is audible palpitation of the heart.
As we go over the symptoms of the text we will notice something singular about the complaints, that is, their tendency to affect the left side, or to, begin on the left and extend to the right. The paralysis begins by gradually appearing weakness upon the left side. Which extends to the right side. It has a strong affinity for the ovaries, and in this it will be found that the left ovary is affected first. So, in inflammation of the ovaries, the left will be affected first, and later the right.
The inflammation begins on the left side of the throat and gradually goes to the right. The left side of the head is commonly most affected. The left eye becomes painful and the pain extends to the right. The left side of the back of the head, in the occipital headache, will be more affected than the right. This does not always follow, and if the reverse is true it does not contra-indicate Lach., but such is the common feature of it. Left upper and right lower has been observed.
In many symptoms of Lachesis, there is morning aggravation. This is the well-known Lachesis aggravation after sleep; the patient will sleep into the aggravation. In the milder symptoms this aggravation is mild and is not felt until after the patient wakes up from a long sleep, but if the aggravation is one that is of considerable violence, the patient may feel it immediately on going to sleep, and it arouses him; for instance, the heart symptoms. As soon as he goes into a sleep he rouses up with palpitation, with dyspnoea, with suffocation, with exhaustion, with vertigo, with pain in the back of the head, and many other circulatory disturbances.
Mind: The next most important thing to be studied is the mental state. Nothing stands out more boldly than the self-consciousness, the self conceit, the envy, the hatred, the revenge and the cruelty of the man. These things, of course, are matters of self-consciousness, an improper love of self. Confusion of the mind to insanity.
All sorts of impulsive insanity. The mind is tired. The patient puts on an appearance like the maudlin of a drunkard, talks with thick lips and thick tongue, blunders and stumbles, only partly finishing words; the face is purple and the head is hot.
There is choking and the collar is uneasy about the neck; and the more uneasiness about the neck, the more choking, the more confusion of mind and the more appearance of intoxication. You will see if you talk with one who is intoxicated with whiskey symptoms like Lachesis, he stumbles through, hardly realizing what he
says, half finishing his sentences and his words, leaving his "g's" off, all the present participles; he stumbles and blunders, he mutters, and tells you first one thing and then another.
These symptoms are increased under the circumstances mentioned in the Spring; in the warm weather following a cold spell; in rainy weather; after a warm bath; after sleep.
The mental state is large. Jealousy without any reason. Unwarranted jealousy and suspicion. Many times this medicine has cured suspicion in girls, when they were simply suspicious of their girl friends. She never sees a whispered conversation going on but they are talking about her, to her detriment.
Suspects that they are contriving to injure her, and she will resort to any scheme to see if they were not talking of her to her detriment. A woman imagines that her friends, husband, and children are trying to damage her; that her friends are going to put her in an insane asylum.
Apprehension of the future. Thinks she is going to have heart disease, and is going insane; and that people are contriving to put her in an insane asylum. Imagine her relatives are trying to poison her and she refuses to eat. She thinks sometimes that it is only a dream and she can hardly say whether she dreamed it or whether she thinks it. She thinks she is dead, or dreams that she is dead, and in the dream preparations are being made to lay her out, or that she is about to die.
Thinks she is somebody else, and in the hands of a stronger power. She thinks she is under superhuman control. She is compelled to do things by spirits. She hears a command, partly in her dream, that she must carry out. Sometimes it takes the form of voices in which she is commanded to steal, to murder, or to confess things she never did, and she has no peace of mind until she makes a confession of something she has never done.
The torture is something violent until she confesses that which she has not done. Imagines she is pursued. Imagines that she has stolen something, or that somebody thinks she has stolen something, and fears the law. She hears voices and warnings, and in the night she dreams about it. The state of torture is something dreadful, and it then goes into a delirium with muttering. The delirium is carried on like one muttering when drunk. This state increases until unconsciousness comes on and the patient enters into a coma from which he cannot be aroused. The patient also goes through periods of violence and violent delirium.
It is full of religious insanity. You will find a dear, sweet old lady who has always lived what would be called an upright and pious life, yet she is not able to apply the promises that are in the Word of God to herself; these things seem to apply to somebody else but not to her. She is full of wickedness and has committed the unpardonable sin. She is compelled to say these things; she is overwhelmed by these things and she is going to die and going to that awful hell that she reads about. The physician must listen to this with attention.
The physician might make the mistake in this instance of making light of such feelings. If he does, the patient will not return, and he will be deprived of the chance of benefiting her.
No matter what her whims are, no matter what her religious opinions are, her state of mind must be treated with respect. It must be treated as if it were so.
She must have sympathy and kindness. It is an unfortunate thing for a doctor to get a reputation of being an ungodly man, among pious people, as he will be deprived of doing these people an immense amount of good. He must be candid with all the whims and notions of the people that he visits in the world. He must be everybody’s friend and he can be such without any hypocrisy if he is simply an upright and just man.
The state of religious melancholy, with religious insanity, is not uncommonly attended with much loquacity, with talkativeness, which Lachesis is full of. It is commonly among women, very seldom among men, that we find this religious melancholy. Now, this woman is impelled to tell it; she will annoy her intimate friends, day and night, with this story of the damnation of her soul and her wickedness and all, the awful things she has done. If you ask her what things she has committed she will say everything, but you cannot pin her down to the fact that she has killed anybody. If you allow her to go through with her story she will tell you all the crimes in the calendar that she has committed, although she has been a well- behaved and well-disposed woman.
There is another kind of loquacity belonging to Lachesis. The patient is impelled to talk continuously. It is found in another. state in which the patient is compelled to hurry in everything she does and wants everybody else to hurry, With that state of hurry is brought out the loquacity, and this is something far beyond comprehension, until you have once heard it.
There is no use attempting to describe it, it is so rapid, changing from one subject to another. Sentences are sometimes only half finished; she takes it for granted that you understand the balance and she will hurry an. Day and night she is wide awake, and with such sensitiveness to her surroundings that you, would naturally think, from what things she hears and how she is disturbed, by noise, that she can hear the flies walk upon the walls and the clock striking upon the distant steeple.
You do not get all these things in the text, you have to see them applied. But the things I give you that are brought out clinically are those things that have come from applying the symptoms of the remedy at the bedside to sick folks.
"Most extraordinary loquacity, making speeches in very select phrases but jumping off to most heterogeneous subjects."
"One word often leads into the midst of another story."
These states may come on in acute diseases like typhoid, when it will take the usual typhoid delirium, or they may come on in conditions like diphtheria, or in any of the diseases that are characterized by blood poisoning; they may come on in the puerperal state, or may take the form of insanity. It is a long acting remedy, and if it has been abused its effects will last a life time.
In many cases a close connection between the mental symptoms and the heart symptoms will be noticed, especially in young women and girls who have met with disappointment, who have been lying awake nights because of disturbance of the affections, or from disappointment, or from shattered hopes, or from grief.
Prolonged melancholy, mental depression, hysterical symptoms, weeping, mental prostration and despair, with pain in the heart, with a gone sensation or sensation of weakness in the heart, with difficult breathing.
She meditates upon suicide, and finally settles back into an apathetic state, in which there is an aversion to, everything, to work, and even to thinking.
I might impress upon your mind the head symptoms if I related the case of a patient who described her symptoms probably more typically than you can find in the books. She was sitting up in bed and unable to lie down; she was worse from lying down, her face was purple, her eyes were engorged, the face puffed and tumid and the eyelids bloated. She sat there perfectly quiet in bed and described the pain as a surging sensation, which came up the back of the neck and head and then over the head.
That is a typical feature of Lachesis. A surging in waves. Waves of Pain that are not always synchronous with the pulse. They may not relate to the flow of blood at all. The surging is aggravated by motion, not so much in the act of motion, but after moving. It is sometimes felt after walking or changing to another place, and sitting down again; that is, a few seconds after the motion is completed the pain begins, and it comes to its height instantly and then gradually subsides into a very steady surging or a more steady ache.
Head: In the head there is a continuous steady ache, which may be aggravated or aroused into a surging which is so violent that it seems as if it would take the life of the patient.
The headache begins in the morning on waking. The milder Lachesis headaches begin in the morning on awaking and wear off after moving about a while. With the headaches and complaints in general there is a momentary vanishing of thought; all sorts of vertigo. Vertigo, with nausea and vomiting. The vertigo inclines the patient to turn to the left.
Lachesis has bursting pains in the head congestive pains with a feeling as if all the blood in the body must be in the head, because, the extremities are so cold and the head pulsates and hammers. This pulsating headache is part of a general pulsation from head to foot. In all arteries and inflammed parts, there is pulsation. The inflamed ovary pulsates, and it feels at times as if a little hhnmmer were hammering upon the inflammed part with every pulsation of the artery. Lachesis has a number of times cured fistula in ano when associated with this feeling as if a hammer continually hammered the little fistulous pipe.
It has cured fissure of long standing when it felt as if the inflamed part were being hammered. Haemorrhoids have been cured when this sensation of hammering was present. So that we see this pulsation in the head is not a special symptom, but is a general symptom, brought out in relation to the head.
Some symptoms are valuable because of the frequency of their association, and when such is the case their concomitant relation. becomes important. The cardiac symptoms are frequently connected with the headache symptoms in Lachesis. It is seldom that you will see Lachesis headaches without cardiac difficulty. A weak pulse or the pulsation felt all over the body, is more or less associated with violent Lachesis headaches.
In the text we find weight and pressure as a strong feature of the Lachesis head symptoms. With almost any complaint of the body, with typhoids, at the menstrual period, during the congestive chill, it seems that the body becomes cold, the extremities become cold, the knees are cold, the feet are cold, and it is impossible to keep them warm, while the face is purple and mottled, the eyes are protruding and engorged, and this awful pain in the head, with a tendency to become unconscious, incoherent speech, difficulty of articulation, and finally actual unconsciousness.
In relation to the head symptoms and mind symptoms and the sensorium in general, the oversensitiveness that is found in Lachesis ought to be mentioned. His symptoms become very intense. The vision becomes very intense; the hearing becomes intense; the sense of touch especially is overwrought. The touch of the
clothing becomes very painful, while hard pressure may be agreeable. The scalp becomes so sensitive to the touch of the hand that it is painful, while the pressure from a bandage is agreeable.
Oversensitive to noise, oversensitive to motion in the room, to conversation and to others walking over the floor. By these circumstances the pains are increased. The patient becomes extremely sensitive throughout all the senses of the body.
The oversensitiveness to touch is probably extensively in the skin, because of the fact that hard pressure often gives relief. In one who is suffering from peritonitis, front inflammation of the ovaries or uterus, or any of the abdominal viscera, the skin is so sensitive to. the clothing that contrivances are sometimes necessary to relieve the suffering from, the touch of the bed clothing. Something in the form of a hoop will be found in the bed, or the patient will have the knees drawn up, or with the hands will hold the clothing from touching the body. The ordinary weight of the hand may bring out the soreness that is in the abdomen, which is an entirely different soreness, whereas the clothing touching the abdomen only brings out the oversensitiveness of the skin. The mere touch of the skin with the finger or hand is unbearable.
Eyes: There are many inflammatory and congestive conditions of the eyes.
The eye symptoms are worse after sleep, and the eyes are oversensitive to touch and light. With the eye symptoms we have headaches, because the brain and eyes are so closely associated. In the sore throats, when the spatula or tongue depressor happens to touch the wall of the throat, the tonsil, or the root of the tongue, there is a feeling as if the eyes would be pressed out. Violent pain in the eyes from touching the throat.
Lachesis is a great jaundice medicine, because it produces much disturbance in the liver. Yellowness of the skin and whites of the eyes, and thickening of tissues about the eyes.
"Fistula lachrymalis," which is accompanied by long standing eruptions about the face.
Oversensitiveness of the meatus auditorus externus. Anything introduced into the canal of the ear will cause violent, spasmodic coughing and tickling in the throat. So sensitive is the mucous membrane of the ear that a violent cough, like whooping cough, will come on from touching the mucous membrane of the ear. This only shows the oversensitiveness of reflexes, and the oversensitiveness in general. With the hearing there is the same oversensitiveness that we have spoken of elsewhere. The Eustachian tube becomes closed with a catarrhal thickening, stricture of the Eustachian tube.
Nose: The catarrhal symptoms of the nose are prominent. Frequent bleeding of the nose and body, watery discharge from the nose. Always taking cold in the nose. Stuffing up of the nose, with disturbance of smell. Oversensitiveness to smell, and oversensitiveness to odors, finally loss of smell.
Lachesis has inflammatory conditions, very chronic in character, with crusty formations in the nose, sneezing, watery discharges from the nose and catarrhal headaches. Sometimes the headache goes off when the catarrhal discharge comes, and when the catarrhal discharge stops the headache comes on. Violent headache with discharge, with sneezing and coryza. Congestive headaches with coryza.
This catarrhal condition has led to the use of Lachesis in syphilis. It is sufficiently similar to cope with the severe forms of nasal syphilis; syphilis where it has affected the nasal mucous membrane, producing crusts and finally affecting the bones. Fetid oezena; very offensive discharges from the nose. Bleeding from the nose need not surprise you, because Lachesis is a hemorrhagic remedy.
The blood from the nose or any part, when it dries or clots, looks like charred straw or becomes black. Parts bleed easily. Copious and prolonged uterine hemorrhage, copious and prolonged menstruation, bleeding front the nose, vomiting of blood, hemorrhage from the bowels in typhoids.
"Great sensitiveness of the nostrils and lips, swelling of the lips, great swelling and tumefaction of the nose in old cases of syphilis."
The nose swells up and becomes purple. The nasal bones are very sore, soreness upon sides of the nose. Lachesis is an especially useful medicine in old drunkards who have red nose, and in heart affections with red nose. A red knob on the end of the nose, a strawberry nose.
Face: The face is purple and mottled, the eyelids are tumid, very much puffed; not bloated as in oedematous subjects, but puffed. There is not the pitting upon pressure that we find in oedema, although Lachesis has that, but there is a puffiness peculiar to Lachesis, the face looks swollen and inflamed, due toa venous stasis, so that the face is purple and mottled.
The nose is tumid, yet it will not remain pitted upon pressure. The lips feel as if inflamed, yet are not inflamed, simply sensitive to pressure. The face has also an oedematous appearance in which there is pitting upon pressure, in cardiac affections, in cases of Bright's disease. On the other hand the face becomes very pale, pale and cold; the skin covered with scaly eruptions.
Eruptions that bleed easily, with crusty eruptions, with vesicular eruptions. Eruptions that fill with blood, bloody vesicles and large blood blisters, such as occur sometimes in burns, with burning. The face becomes jaundiced and very sallow. At times it takes on the appearance also of a chlorosis.
If you have once seen the chlorotic color, it need not be described. It is a condition of anemia, with yellowish pallor, ash colored or grey, intermingled with a sort of greenish color, so that the ancients often referred to it as green sickness. Again the face becomes livid and puffed like the bloated aspect of drunkards, the mottled purple appearance of drunkards who have been drinking for years, until they are bloated and broken down and have a besotted aspect. You see that in Lachesis.
In Lachesis we have a remedy for erysipelas and gangrenous affections, and about the affected part there is the Lachesis appearance, that is the mottled, purplish appearance. Lachesis has become clinically a marked remedy for erysipelas and for gangrene. As provers do not follow up remedies until they produce these things, we have to gather them from the poisonous effects and clinical observation.
Mouth: In Lachesis there is oozing of blood around the teeth, the gums bleed easily. Dry crusts appear upon the teeth in zymotic diseases, often black formations, sordes, and the tongue takes part in the appearance of the mouth and becomes slick. This occurs in typhoid conditions when there is a total loss of assimilation, the appetite is entirely gone, the stomach will not take food, and when food is put into the stomach it is rejected. There is also paresis of the tongue. The tongue seems to be like leather in the mouth, it is moved with great difficulty. And the speech is like that of one half intoxicated; he is unable to articulate.
The tongue swells and is protruded very slowly. It is dry and catches on the teeth and seems to have lost its stiffness. Seems like a rag, or as if the muscles did not act upon it so that it cannot be protruded, or if it is protruded it trembles and quivers and jerks and catches on the teeth. Again it is swollen, it is denuded of its papillae, and smooth, shiny and glassy as if varnished.
In the mouth there is a soapy appearance of the saliva. The saliva runs into the mouth copiously and the patient will often lie with the head over the side of the bed, and the saliva dripping into a pan or commode. The saliva is stringy and can be pulled out of the mouth in strings; white mucus or saliva.
This is not an uncommon feature in diphtheria, in sore throat, in inflammation of the tongue and mouth and gums, and in inflammation of the salivary glands. When this mucus is thick, tough, yellow, stringy and ropy it is like Kali bichromicum. You will often find in severe sore throat that the patient will lie and gag; and cough, and attempt with difficulty to protrude the tongue to expel the saliva from the mouth.
Very often the pain is so severe in the root of the tongue that he cannot expel the saliva by the tongue and he will lie with the open mouth over a commode, or with a cloth over the pillow, to receive the thick, ropy saliva. In such a state with sore throats, especially those that commence on the left side and go to the right, you hardly need to question longer, for it is the aspect of Lachesis.
This state of affairs would lead to Lachesis in ordinary inflammatory conditions of the tongue and in cancerous affections of the tongue. Lach. has in its nature the tendency to formation of malignant scabs and malignant ulcers, such as we find in epithelioma. It has cured a number of cases of epithelioma. It has been a very useful remedy in lupus. It is an important remedy in syphilitic sore throat, in syphilitic ulceration of the throat, tongue and roof of the mouth with this copious, stingy saliva.
Pharynx: The muscles of the pharynx become paralyzed and will not act, and hence the food will collect in the pharynx, that is, the bolus to be swallowed goes to the pharynx and stops, and then a tremendous effort at swallowing, with gagging and coughing and spasmodic action of the chest, takes place in order to carry on respiration, and he will not again attempt it. This state often occurs with diphtheria.
I have a number of times seen it brought about by the physician, who has, instead of giving just enough Lachesis, high enough and similar enough to the disease to cure, given it as low as he could get it, the 8 th or 10 th, dissolved it in water and fed it all through the diphtheritic state.
When you come across cases that have been treated in this way you need not be surprised if a post- diphtheritic paralysis comes on, because Lachesis will produce it. It may cure the diphtheria, but it will leave its poisonous effects which will last that patient a lifetime. Every spring the symptoms of Lachesis will crop out. In all the circumstances of aggravation described the symptoms of Lachesis will crop out if he has once been poisoned by it.
In the sore throat we have a combination of symptoms. Lachesis has produced this state, going from left to right; but with the sore throat there is a sensation of fullness in the neck and throat, difficult breathing, pallor or plethoric appearance of the face, choking when going into sleep, the peculiar kind of saliva and aggravation of the throat symptoms from warm drinks.
There is not always an aggravation of the pain itself from warm drinks, but the patient is often unable to swallow warm fluids. The swallowing of warm fluids often causes choking, and after a swallow of warm tea is taken the patient will clutch at the throat and it seems as if he would suffocate. He says,
"Oh I do not give me any more warm drinks."
Something cold will relieve. The dyspnoea and the distress about the throat is increased by swallowing something warm. Now, in the sore throats of Lycopodium, warmth often benefits, but it is also true in some cases of Lycopodium sore throat, they want cold drinks and cold feels good to the throat.
Very often in the more acute symptoms of Lachesis a warm drink in the stomach is hurtful and causes nausea and suffocation and increases the choking and palpitation and the fullness in the head, whereas in the chronic cases of Lachesis, those that have been poisoned years before, there will be a sensation of nausea and tendency to vomit from taking a drink of cold water and then lying down.
The nausea comes on after lying down, that is, let the patient take a drink of ice cold water and go to bed and nausea will come on. Such a state is peculiar to Lachesis. It has been a later observation of those who have long before proved Lachesis. The symptoms of Lachesis have sometimes to be taken years after.
Lachesis has ulcers in the throat. It has aphthous patches, it has red and grey ulceration, it has deep ulceration. The tendency to ulceration upon the margins of mucous membranes is peculiar to Lachesis.
Also ulceration upon the skin, where the circulation is feeble. It seems that the pain in the throat is particularly marked between the acts of swallowing, and the pressure of the bolus going over the inflamed tonsils relieves the pain.
Always choking when swallowing, choking and gagging in the throat.
The cough is a choking cough and produces a sensation of tickling. This is like the Bell. cough. Bell. antidotes a Lach. cough, it has a cough so much like Lach. that no one can tell them apart.
Again the throat takes on extreme dryness in Lach., and this dryness is without thirst, dryness with aversion to water. Much inclination to swallow; the tendency is to continuously swallow, yet it is painful. Empty swallowing is more painful, than the swallowing of solids. Some Lach. patients suffering from cardiac affections are annoyed with constriction of the throat, choking in the throat when anything warm is swallowed, and sometimes when going into a warm room, choking and palpitation of the heart.
Tendency to chronic sore throat or recurrent sore throat and ulceration with every recurring sore throat. Liquids, of course, you will see, are analogous to empty swallowing, and empty swallowing causes more pain than the bolus which presses upon the sore throat, because it is of the nature of a slight touch. The slight touch increases the soreness and pain in the throat. Slight pressure of the collar increases the pain in the throat.
With the sore throat the muscles and glands about the neck become painful, inflamed and swollen, and very tender to the touch. With the sore throat, very commonly, there is pain in the base of the brain or in the back of the head, and soreness of the muscles of the back of the neck, which is often relieved by lying on the back and aggravated by lying on either side.
If you look into the throat it has a mottled, purplish appearance. Put all these things together, with the copious flow of tenacious saliva, and you will be able to manage cases of diphtheria that commence on the left side and spread to the right, whether the membrane is scanty or copious.
Tonsilitis with suppuration of the tonsils, when the left tonsil becomes inflamed and after a day or two the right one becomes inflamed and swollen, and they both finally go on to suppuration, or when one swells and suppurates and the other swells and suppurates. Diphtheritic appearances of the throat, spreading from left to right. The pharynx is full of thick, white, ropy mucus in the morning; must hawk out a mouthful of mucus in the morning.
Abdomen: The abdomen is distended with flatus. The abdomen is tympanitic in typhoid condition, much rumbling in the distended abdomen. The clothing cannot be tolerated, not even the slightest touch of the clothing, and yet it may require hard pressure to bring out soreness that is deep in the abdomen. This state
is as it is in inflammation of bowels, ovaries and uterus, the patient lies on the back with the clothing lifted from the abdomen.
Violent labor-like pains, menstrual colic, present in typhoid, in puerperal fever, in malignant scarlet fever, in the more malignant affections of zymotic forms of the continued fever.
Lach. has a series of liver troubles with jaundice; congestion of the liver, inflammation of the liver, enlarged liver and the nutmeg liver. Cutting like a knife in the region of the liver. Vomiting of bile; vomiting of everything taken into the stomach. Extreme nausea; continuous nausea with jaundice. White stool. It has cured cases with gall stone.
"Cannot endure any pressure about the hypochondria."
In the chronic state the sensitiveness of the skin is so great over the abdomen, and about the waist and hips, that the wearing of the clothing creates pain, great restlessness and uneasiness, the patient grows increasingly nervous and finally goes into hysterics. Sensitiveness over the lower abdomen; can scarcely allow her clothes to touch her.
Female: It seems strange at first reading that Lachesis can be such a common remedy at the menstrual period.
It is also laid down as a remedy for the climacteric period. Now if you will study the cases of many women at the climacteric period you will find that many of them have the flushes of heat and the surgings in the head and the great circulatory disturbances that are found under Lachesis. This is also true of the complaints, the headaches, etc., that come in women at the climacteric period and at the menstrual period.
The Lachesis symptoms are strong in women during menstruation. There is violent headache, boring pain in the vertex, nausea and vomiting during menses.
The discharge in the female, either as a menstrual flow or as a hemorrhage, is black blood. Pain in the left ovarian region, or going from left to right. Induration of one or both ovaries. It has cured suppuration of the ovaries. The uterine region is very sensitive to touch, to the slightest contact of the clothing; in inflammation of the ovaries, pains in the ovaries and uterus going from left to right. Pains in the pelvis going upwards to the chest, sometimes a surging of pain going upwards, grasping the throat. Labor pains surge up, with clutching at the throat, or the labor pains cease suddenly, with clutching at the throat.
The menstrual pains increase violently until relieved by the flow. The menstrual sufferings are before and after the flow, with amelioration during the flow. The menstrual flow intermits one day and then goes on for one day, and during the intermission there is likely to be pain or headache.
Menorrhagia with chills at night and flushes of heat in the daytime. During the menstrual period violent headache, especially at such times as the flow slackens up.
It is a general feature of Lachesis to be relieved by discharges.
Catamenia flow but one hour every day; on stopping, violent pains follow in region of left ovary, alternating with gagging and vomiturition.
It is especially useful at the menopause, because of the flushes of heat. Uterine hemorrhage, fainting spells, suffocation in a warm room; orgasm of blood most violent. Complaints during pregnancy.
Inflammation of the veins of the leg. Varicose veins, blue or purple, extreme sensitiveness along the veins; sensitive to the slightest touch, though relieved by pressure.
The study of Lachesis is only a commentary on some of its important parts.
Laurocerasus
The many strange constitutional symptoms indicate feeble circulation and weak heart.
Great general coldness, that is not ameliorated by external warmth. It is like wrapping up a dead man. Yet if he approaches a warm stove nausea comes on. If he is in a warm room the sweat breaks out on the forehead and the forehead is cold; but if he moves about slowly in the open air the sweat ceases and the forehead
warms up.
Want of animal heat. Want of reaction. Remedies act only as palliatives, act only as short acting remedies in constitutional disease, or the symptoms partially subside but the patient does not react. The patient does not convalesce.
It often cures the heart failure due to Digitalis in Old School hands, or when convalescence is attended by weak heart if there is cold skin and external heat is objectionable. It should be compared with Camph., Am. c. and Secale.
A prolonged fainting spell; twitching of the limbs, gasping for breath. Complaints after deep sorrow or fright. Chorea after every excitement. Spells of profound sleep with snoring or stertorous breathing.
In the spells of suffocation, he must lie down (Psorinum) but the dry hacking cough comes on as soon he lies down.
Weakness of body and mind. Fainting. Motionless. Apprehensiveness.
Vertigo in the open air; he must lie down.
Coldness of the forehead in a warm room, ameliorated in the open air.
Stupefying pains in the head, with pulsation.
Stitching pains in the head.
Periodical paroxysms of aching pain under the frontal bone.
Sensation as if brain fell forward on stooping.
Tension in the brain. Headache is sometimes ameliorated by eating. The scalp itches. Dim vision. Veil before the eyes. Objects larger.
The face is blue, sunken, bloated, and expressionless; jaundiced yellow spot.
Formication of the face. Lockjaw. Mouth and tongue dry. The tongue is dry, cold and numb; stiff and swollen.
Spasmodic contraction of throat and oesophagus; drink rolls audibly down the oesophagus and through the intestines.
Emptiness in stomach after eating (Dig.) as if he were still hungry. Violent thirst. Loathing of food. Nausea on coming near a warm stove. Vomiting of food with the cough. Eructations, tasting like bitter almonds. Violent pain in stomach, with cold skin.
Coldness in stomach and abdomen. Contractions like cramps in stomach and cutting in abdomen. Pain in liver as though an abscess were forming. Stitching pain in liver on pressure. Rumbling in bowels.
Diarrhoea, with green mucus, and green watery stools, with tenesmus.
Constipation, with difficult stool. It cures cholera infantum with green watery stools when drinks gurgle down the oesophagus and there is general coldness, blueness, and fainting spells.
The whole urinary apparatus is in a paralytic state. Suppression of urine or retention, or urine passed in a very feeble stream. Involuntary urination. Pain, in stomach when passing urine. These urinary symptoms sometimes come with palpitation and suffocation, and fainting spells, or other cardiac symptoms and Laurocerasus must be consulted.
Menses too frequent, profuse, thin, with tearing in vertex at night. Uterine hemorrhage, with flow dark and clotted during climaxis. Fainting spells with coldness during menses. Pain in sacrum during menses.
Heart patients that often suffer much from constriction of the larynx are helped by this remedy. Laryngismus stridulus.
Difficult breathing. Suffocation, oppression of chest, gasping in heart complaints, ameliorated by lying down. Clutching at the heart and palpitation. It has cured mitral regurgitation many times,
Short, hacking, dry, nervous cough. Cardiac cough.
Whooping-cough in puny children when there is a history of feeble heart, blue cold skin, and laryngeal spasm. Paralytic chest symptoms.
Irregular action of the heart, slow pulse, fluttering heart. Sitting up causes gasping; lying ameliorates the oppression. Feeble pulse, cold blue surface, twitching of muscles of face and limbs. Slight exertion aggravates all the symptoms. Cyanosis neonatorum.
Burning in chest on inspiration.
The veins of the hands are distended. Cold clammy feet and legs. Painless paralysis of limbs. Stinging and tearing in limbs. Feet numb from lying with limbs crossed.
Ledum Palustre
Surgeon: This remedy comes up well after the study of Lachesis, for we find in the pathogenesis many features similar to those in Lachesis.
It has the mottled aspect and the same puffed and bloated appearance of the face. It is antidotal to Lachesis, to the poison of insects, to the poison of Apis and to animal poisons.
Ledum is a remedy for the surgeon, and is closely associated in traumatism with Arnica and Hypericum. The symptoms very much resemble such as follow certain kinds of injury, for instance an injury from stepping on tacks, from puncturing with needles, wounds that bleed scantily but are followed by pain, puffiness and coldness of the part.
Causation: Stepping on a nail and it pierces the sole of the foot or the heel, or he receives such a wound in the palm of the hand from a splinter, or he runs a splinter under the nail.
If, after such punctured wounds, the part becomes cold and then pale, paralyzed and mottled think of Ledum. The horse sometimes steps on a nail. If that nail goes through and strikes the margin of the coffin bone, tetanus will follow. It is known to be almost sure death. Put Ledum on the tongue of that horse and there will not be any trouble, for it prevents such conditions.
When tetanus comes on from punctured wounds in the palms or soles, or in other parts, think of Hypericum, or when you have a punctured wound to treat, give Ledum at once and you will prevent tetanus.
When the finger nails have been torn, or the nerves in sentient parts like the ends of the fingers have been torn and lacerated, Hypericum becomes the remedy.
For bruising of various parts, and when the patient feels as if braised all over, no matter how extensively he is bruised, Arnica is generally the remedy.
It may be said, for punctured wounds study Ledum; for lacerated wounds of sentient nerves, study Hypericum; for bruises, study Arnica; for open lacerations and cuts, study Calendula.
The conditions that come from the external, ought to be remedied to a great extent by external means. A solution of Calendula is excellent in conditions that come from the external, and it should be applied externally. When you have lacerated wounds and cuts with knives or other sharp instruments, apply Calendula, because the injury is external without internal effects.
The symptoms that arise from internal cause, treat with internal remedies, and symptoms that arise from external cause, when all that there is of the case is external, treat locally; in other words, for local causes use local means, and for internal or dynamic causes, use internal means.
Let internal wrongs be treated by the homoeopathic remedy and external or local conditions be treated by such soothing dressings as are most comfortable. Always protect surfaces that are exposed, and raw, and bleeding with something of a bland and superficial character.
Wounds must be dressed with as simple a means as possible, and there is no simpler dressing than Calendula, one part to four or six of water. The tincture will smart too much. Your open wounds will
granulate most beautifully under Calendula, and you will have no constitutional effects. When the constitutional state is orderly and there is an open injury let the constitution alone, but put on some soothing application externally. In doing this there is no law to govern the action of the physician.
Air is an irritant to a raw part and will keep up an unnecessary discharge of pus, even from a perfectly healthy sore.
Calendula will keep it protected. The sides of a cut must be drawn together, and if it is perfectly tight it will heal itself by first intention. If it does not, then you may know there is a constitutional condition that you must ferret out and find the remedy for. Local treatment must then be suspended.
These remedies that I have mentioned, to a great extent, cover the management of wounds, and it is simple. Anyone has sense enough to draw together and close up a yawning wound, and to properly dress it. The muscles that naturally draw a wound open have to be overcome by stitches or by strappings. They do not belong to prescribing, they belong to the surgeon.
Coldness: The Ledum patient is very often subject to what may be called constitutional coldness, coldness to touch, coldness in the lady and coldness in the extremities with hot head, and again we see the other extreme, where the whole body is overheated, and the head also is in a state of great heat. There is throbbing and pulsating all over the body; the skin is purple or is too highly colored; he wants the covers all off at night. It is not uncommon to hear a patient, who has a Ledum headache, say that she wants the head out in the cold air, wants to put it out of the window, does not want any covering upon the head; delights to bathe it with very cold water.
Ledum has a bloated condition of the hands, face, and feet; bloated and purple from the knees down in certain dropsical conditions. With this purple, mottled, bloated condition from the knees to the feet the swelling as big as the skin will allow, and the pain excruciating.
The only relief that patient gets is by sitting, with the feet in a tub of ice cold water. I remember the first time I ever saw this in a patient. He was an old syphilitic, whose nasal bones had been eaten cut by syphilis, and his nose was a flabby piece of skin; it had no stiffening in it. He was a drunkard, and was extremely abusive to his family when drunk.
He had been for several years unwilling to work, having lost his ambition, and he would sit in the house and allow his wife to wait upon him. He had practically become a tramp, only he could not tramp, for this dropsical condition had come on and his feet were so badly swollen and sensitive that he sat in the house day after day. When I first saw him he had before him a good-sized old-fashioned wash-tub, and there he sat with the ice water two-thirds up to his knees and pieces of ice floating around on the top of the water, which he liked to have coming in contact with the skin.
When that ice was out he would put in more. The wife described his sufferings by saying he "suffered agonies something; dreadful."
Ledum took his feet out of the ice water so that he never used it afterwards. It caused the purpleness to disappear, the bloating went out of his feet, and he quit drinking. Ledum cured him of his syphilitic trouble, and he never had a return of that original state.
Pulsatilla and Ledum are the two principal remedies that want the feet in very cold water. But Ledum suited that man.
Bleeding: Where there are inflamed surfaces the tendency in Ledum is to bleed, and the blood is black. Ledum patients are full-blooded and plethoric, of a robust character. Such plethoric patients bleed easily, have red faces; they are fleshy, strong and of robust constitution. Hemorrhages sometimes occur in the chamber of the eye, hemorrhage of the nose, hemorrhage in cavities, bloody urine. Old painful ulcers that spread, that are mottled round about, in a constitution that always wants to be cold. The ulcers are relieved by cold,
Rheumatism: This remedy is of a rheumatic nature, rheumatic and gouty. It is a gouty medicine, having complaints in persons who suffer from gout, and have chalk stones in their joints, deposits in the wrists, fingers and toes.
The deposits go from below upwards. The gouty joints become suddenly inflamed and are relieved by cold. Ledum especially singles out the knee; it is suitable in old prolonged cases of inflammation of the kneejoint, of rheumatic knee-joint. You will find such patients sitting with the joint exposed to the cold, fanning the joint, or putting evaporating lotions upon the joint, such as chloroform, or ether, which give relief to the joints while evaporating to dryness.
Rheumatic and gouty extremities with pain and swelling; pain worse from motion, worse at night and from warmth of bed; better from cold applications with copious pale urine. The pains and swelling go upwards and the heart becomes affected.
Face: The face I have already described as puffy or bloated like the Lachesis face. It is a besotted face and looks very much like the face of an old drunkard. Ledum counteracts the effect of whiskey, and takes away the appetite for whiskey. Ledum is to whiskey what Caladium is to the smoking habit. You can break patients from the habit of smoking so that they go to the other extreme, and have an aversion to it.
It has erysipelas, as you might expect. It has a blue, mottled and puffed and sometimes oedematous appearance. It takes on an acute character and becomes burning. Phlegmonous erysipelas of any part of the body, but particularly of the face, or the injured part.
Lilium Tigrinum So far as proved Lilium Tigrinum has shown itself adapted to the complaints of women.
It is especially suited to hysterical women, who suffer from uterine troubles, cardiac troubles and various nervous manifestations; suitable to a woman who is extremely irritable, full of fanciful notions, insanity, religious melancholy and imaginations, with cardiac affections and prolapsus.
These conditions often alternate; when the mental symptoms are most marked the physical symptoms are relieved. The "dragging down" that is associated with prolapsus seems to be a dragging down from the region of the stomach, and even sometimes from the throat.
A bearing down, as if all the interior organs were dragging down. With this state of extreme relaxation there is great fidgetiness and most marked of all, palpitation. She can lie only on the back, and is aggravated from lying on either side. From every emotion the heart flutters, and is irregular and excitable. These mental symptoms and heart symptoms and uterine symptoms often rotate or alternate, and constitute the principal features.
Mind: She can hardly speak a decent word to anybody. She will snap even when spoken to kindly. She is so irritable that her friends cannot pacify her. Even consolation aggravates. When spoken to she is irritable. She lies awake nights, and is tormented either by fanatical religious ideas, or a religious melancholy, and seems inclined to dwell upon insane, ideas concerning religion and modes of life unreasonable, illogical and fanciful.
Has wrong ideas concerning everything. Receives wrong impressions and everything is inverted. It is impossible to please her. Now these states are present with a state of irritability of the sexual organs, nymphomania; violent sexual excitement associated with spasms, with palpitation, with sweats, with periods of exhaustion. She sits alone and broods over imaginary troubles, and when spoken to is crabbed.
"Ideas not clear; they become more so if she exercises her will." "Makes mistakes in writing, in speaking, cannot apply the mind steadily; tormented about her salvation."
The patient tries to describe an indescribable feeling by saying she has a "crazy feeling” in the head, as if the ideas scattered, and the more she attempts to think rationally the more irrational she becomes. The more she attempts to think of something the less likely she is to recall it. When putting the mind upon something else it comes back again. This remedy has all kinds of symptoms from sexual excesses in overwrought and nervous women, from sexual excitement, causing confusion of mind with palpitation.
It says in the text: "Listless, inert, yet does not want to sit still."
This patient will sit still and brood and think over the past, and when spoken to will jump up and run hastily and excitedly and slam the door without any cause; when spoken to kindly by members of the family, or a friend, it seems that she will go wild. A patient once under an aggravation from this remedy said to me:
"I was spoken to to-day in a street car, and I was so mad I wanted to fling something at his head."
She was thinking over something about herself, and did not want to be disturbed. It is a violent state of temper, a violent state of irritability, a loss of balance. She says:
"It seems as if I must fly when spoken to or disturbed."
When coming in contact with her friends she has these feelings. The contact seems to arouse her out of a state of lassitude and quietness. Strange things occur in this remedy. The sensations described in the text are so vague and so varied that you can see that it is an effort on the part of the provers to describe what they feel. The sensations are numerous and indescribable.
This patient very commonly is a warm-blooded patient.
She is like the Pulsatilla patient; warm-blooded, wants a cool room, likes to walk in the open air, except at times when the prolapsus is aggravated by walking. The head is generally relieved by moving about in the open air, > when walking in the open air. The headache and most of the complaints are relieved from cold, or from a cool room, and aggravated from a warm room. The dyspnoea comes on in a warm room. The patient suffocates in a crowded room, in the theatre, in church, like Apis, Iodine, Kalii., Lyc. and Puls.
Head: A crazy feeling comes up from the back of the head to the top of the head.
What that is only one that feels it can describe. It is described sometimes as a tingling, or an electric sensation. A slight tingling comes up the back of the head and goes to the top, and is associated with vertigo. When you come to sift that thought it really brings nothing to mind. Very often you have to get those things clinically, and think about them to get at the idea.
The pains in the forehead are very marked, and they are associated with great disturbance of vision, a loss of vision, the room looks dark, or the eyes are unable to focus. Nervous disturbance of vision, photophobia, twitching of the lids, jerking about the eyeballs, and inflammation of the mucous membrane of the eyes, of the lids and balls, conjunctivitis. Very often with the complaints of the head the eyes are turned in, a convergent strabismus, or there is threatened syncope, with the pain in the forehead.
By all these things mentioned it may be known what an over-sensitive, extremely nervous, hysterical person the Lilium tig. patient must be. These things are commonly associated with patients who are extremely nervous, who have fluttering of the heart, who have pain down the spine, and more or less prolapsus, with a great sense of dragging down. When one condition is present, the other is commonly absent; they alternate, or they may exist all together.
"Wild feeling in the head, as tho' she would go crazy, with pain in the right iliac region." These provers seemed to like the expression, "crazy feeling in the head, as if she would go crazy".
That crazy feeling is a confusion of mind, as if the mind were quite unable to concentrate itself. That is what is interpreted by this crazy feeling the patients have. It is sometimes like a vertigo, as if things were going round, or as if she would lose her mind. Then it comes again as a terrible, tearing headache, described as a crazy headache in the forehead. Headache in which there is confusion of the mind, or as if the mind would go crazy.
Abdomen: The abdomen, stool, urinary and sexual organs, furnish us a field for the use of this medicine.
The whole abdominal viscera seem to be dragging down from the stomach. The patient wants to hold up the abdomen, pendulous abdomen. It seems as if the pelvic organs would protrude. The patient must lie down, wants to wear a T bandage. Wants to grasp the abdomen from the sides and lift up for support. It is a sensation of weakness or bearing down in the pelvis as if everything were coming into the world through the vagina.
This remedy has a very urgent diarrhoea, driving out of bed in the morning; he must make great baste. You may get this confused with Sulphur, because Lilium tig. has great heat in the head, emptiness in the stomach, and great burning of the palms and soles. It has also a dysentery that you will hardly be able to distinguish from Merc. cor., so marked is the tenesmus, mucus and blood.
The stool is merely mucus mingled with blood, and the tenesmus is as great and the burning in the anus as marked as in Merc. cor. It is especially suited for those attacks of dysentery that come on as an occasional chronic manifestation in nervous patients such as I have described. Now, do not think that because this patient is nervous that she is weak, or liliputian, or lean; for it is especially suitable for those with full veins; apparently plethoric, full blooded, fleshy, rotund women who are very nervous, and especially at the change of life.
Recurrent dysenteric attacks with every cold in those who suffer from pelvic and abdominal relaxation, mental irritability as described, palpitation and fluttering of the heart, with nervous constitutions. You do not see Merc. cor. in such a picture. If it were a dysentery alone I would not be able to tell which it was.
All of these dysenteric manifestations have been left out of the Guiding Symptoms, yet I have seen them verified over and over. Again, it has a most inveterate and troublesome constipation.
It has also a tenesmus of the bladder and rectum. Teasing to urinate, as well as urging to stool. Sit a long time with much urging, and after long straining no stool.
Frequent urging, with a sensation as if a ball were in the rectum. When the fundus of the uterus is turned back to the rectum it gives a sensation as if the rectum were full of faeces; it brings on urging to stool and the patient will sit and strain, and the tenesmus of the bladder and rectum is unbearable. Constant urging to stool, and no stool in the rectum. You will be astonished to know that the remedy that is indicated with such symptoms will relieve the patient of all distress in a short time.
But you ask, will this remedy put the uterus right again? Well, the patient will get relief of her sufferings and will not feel this uncomfortable state after the administration of the remedy. The bowels become regular, the disturbance of micturition is relieved and the patient gradually returns to health and later the uterus will be found in place.
"Pressure in the rectum, with almost constant desire to go to stool." Lilium tigrinum has cured the most inveterate protruding hemorrhoids with burning.
"Haemorrhoids after delivery, sore to touch, bearing down after stool as if all would protrude from the vagina."
It does not mean that we shall apply that simply to hemorrhoids that come after delivery, but it has cured hemorrhoids in such a constitution, and not only hemorrhoids, but relaxed uterus and vagina.
A paralytic relaxation is present in all the abdominal tissues. I have mentioned the uterine symptoms incidentally in connection with other parts.
"Menses scanty, flow only when moving about."
This will make you think of Puls., the menses being so scanty, and because the Puls. patient is of similar nervous temperament. Puls. has scanty menstruation and relief in the open air. It has also much dragging down in the pelvis, though not so extreme as a rule as in this medicine. But there is much in this medicine quite different from Puls.
The come the heart symptoms. "Seems as if the heart were grasped or squeezed in a vise, hard, as if violently grasped."
moe
"Constrictive pain in the heart." "In fresh air, chilly, but vertigo is >."
Pain in the back and down the spine; irritable and sensitive spine with trembling. It competes very closely with Platina.
Lycopodium
Lycopodium is an antipsoric, anti-syphilitic and anti-sycotic, and its sphere is broad and deep. Though classed among the inert substances, and thought to be useful only for rolling up allopathic pills, Hahnemann brought it into use and developed its power by attenuation.
It is amonument to Hahnemann. It enters deep into the life, and ultimate changes in the soft tissues, blood-vessels, bones, liver, heart, joints. The tissue changes are striking; there is tendency to, necrosis, abscesses, spreading ulcers and great emaciation.
Generalities: There is a predominance of symptoms on the right side of the body, and they are likely to travel from right to left or from above downward, e. g., from head to chest.
The patient emaciates above, especially about the neck, while the lower extremities are fairly well nourished. Externally there is sensitiveness to a warm atmosphere when there are head and spine symptoms. The head symptoms also are worse from the warmth of the bed and from heat, and worse from getting heated by exertion.
The patient is sensitive to cold and there is a marked lack of vital heat, and worse in general from cold and cold air and from cold food and drinks. The pains are ameliorated from warmth except of the head and spine.
Exertion aggravates the Lycopodium patient in general. He becomes puffed and distressed, and dyspnoea is increased by exertion. He cannot climb, he cannot walk fast. The cardiac symptoms are increased as well as the dyspnoea by becoming heated from exertion. The inflamed parts are sometimes relieved from the application of heat. The throat symptoms are generally relieved from the application of heat, from drinking hot tea or warm soup. The stomach pains are often relieved by warm drinks and taking warm things into the stomach. Nervous excitement and prostration are marked.
In the rheumatic pains and other sufferings the Lyc. patient is ameliorated by motion. He is extremely restless, must keep turning, and if there is inflammation with the aches and pains the patient is better from the warmth of the bed and relieved from motion, and he will keep tossing all night.
He turns and gets into a new place and thinks he can sleep, but the restlessness continues all night. He wants cool air, wants to be in a cool place with head symptoms. It is true that the headache is worse from motion enough to warm the patient up, but not from the motion itself. The headache is worse from lying down and from the warmth of the room, and better in cold air and from motion until he has moved and exercised sufficiently to become heated, when the headache becomes worse. That is quite an important thing to remember concerning Lycopodium, because it may constitute a distinguishing feature.
The head symptoms are worse from warm wraps and warm bed,
The complaints of Lyc. are likely to be worse at a fixed time, viz., from four till eight o'clock in the evening. An exacerbation comes on in the acute complaints and often in the chronic complaints at this time.
The Lyc. chill and fever is worse at this time, and in typhoid and scarlet fever the patient is especially worse from 4-8 P.M. In gouty attacks, in rheumatic fevers, in inflammatory conditions, in pneumonia, in acute
catarrhs, which are complaints especially calling for Lycopodium, it is always well to think of this remedy when there is a decisive aggravation from 4-8 P.M.
Stomach: The Lycopodium patient is flatulent, distended like a drum, so that he can hardly breathe. The diaphragm is pushed upwards, infringing upon the lung and heart space, so that he has palpitation, faintness and dyspnoea. It is not uncommon to hear a Lycop. patient say,
"Everything I eat turns into wind."
After a mere mouthful he becomes flatulent and distended, so that he cannot eat any more. He says a mouthful fills him up to the throat. While the abdomen is distended he is so nervous that he cannot endure any noise. The noise of the crackling of paper, ringing of bells or slamming of doors goes through him and causes fainting, like Ant. crud., Borax and Natr. mur.
These general conditions go through all complaints, acute and chronic. There is an excitable stage of the whole sensorium in which everything disturbs. Little things annoy and distress.
The Lyc. patient cannot eat oysters; they make him sick. Oysters seem to poison the Lyc. patient, just as onions are a poison to the Thuya patient.
The Oxalic acid patient cannot eat strawberries. If you ever have a patient get sick from eating strawberries, tomatoes or oysters, and you have no homoeopathic remedies at hand, it is a good thing to remember that cheese will digest strawberries or tomatoes or oysters in a few minutes.
Skin: The skin ulcerates. There are painful ulcer, sloughing ulcers beneath the skin, abscesses beneath the skin, cellular troubles. The chronic ulcerations are indolent with false granulations, painful, burning, stinging and smarting, often relieved by applying cooling things and aggravated by warm poultices. It is somewhat a general in Lycopodium that warm poultices and warmth ameliorates; warm applications ameliorate the pain in the knee, the suppurating condition and the gouty troubles. in an unusually warm bed, and in a warm room hives come out.
The hives come out either in nodules or in long and irregular stripes, especially in the heat, and itch violently. Lyc. has eruptions upon the skin, with violent itching. Vesicles and scaly eruptions, moist eruptions and dry eruptions, furfuraceous eruptions, eruptions about the lips, behind the ears, under the wings of the nose and upon the genitals; fissured eruptions, bleeding fissures like salt rheum upon the hands.
The skin becomes thick and indurated. The sites of old boils and pustules become indurated and form nodules that remain a long time. The skin looks unhealthy, and it will slough easily; wounds refuse to heal. Surface wounds suppurate as if they had contained splinters, and this suppuration burrows along under the skin. Ulcers bleed and form great quantities of thick, yellow, offensive, green pus. Chancres and cancroids often find their similimum in Lyc.
The Lyc. state when deciphered shows feebleness throughout. A very low state of the arteries and veins, poor tone and poor circulation. Numbness in spots. Emaciation of single members. Deadness of the fingers and toes. Staggering and inability to make use of the limbs. Clumsiness and awkwardness of the limbs. Trembling of the limbs.
Mind: The mental symptoms of Lyc. are numerous.
He is tired. He has a tired state of the mind, a chronic fatigue, forgetfulness, aversion to undertaking anything new, aversion to appearing in any new role, aversion to his own work. Dreads lest something will happen, lest he will forget something. A continually increasing dread of appearing in public comes on, yet a horror, at times, of solitude.
Often in professional men, like lawyers and ministers, who have to appear in public, there is a feeling of incompetence, a feeling of inability to undertake his task, although he has been accustomed to it for many years.
A lawyer cannot think of appearing in court; he procrastinates, he delays until he is obliged to appear, because he has a fear that he will stumble that he will make mistakes, that he will forget, and yet when he undertakes it he goes through with ease and comfort. This is a striking feature also of Silicea. No medicines have this fear so marked as these two.
Lyc. also has a religious insanity, which has a mild and simple beginning, a matter of melancholy. This religious melancholy grows greater and greater until he sits and broods. He has very often aversion to company, and yet he dreads solitude.
"Dread of men and dread of solitude; irritability and melancholy."
This dread of men is not always a state of dread in women. It is a dread of people, and when that is fully carried out in the Lyc. patient you see that she dreads the presence of new persons, or the coming in of friends or visitors she wants to be only with those that are constantly surrounding her does not want to be entirely alone; wants to feel that there is somebody else in the house, but does not want company; does not want to be talked to, or forced to do anything; does not want to make any exertion, yet at times when forced to do so she is relieved.
"Taciturnity, desires to be alone."
Now, let us follow that out a little further. The taciturnity is because the patient does not want to talk, wants to keep silent, yet, as I have said already, very glad to feel there is somebody else in the house and that she is not alone. She is perfectly willing to remain in a little room by herself, so that she is practically alone, yet not in solitude. If there were two adjacent rooms in the house you would commonly find the Lyc. patient go into one and stay there, but very glad to have somebody in the other.
The Lycopodium patient often weeps in the act of receiving a friend or meeting an acquaintance. An unusual sadness with weeping comes over this patient on receiving a gift. At the slightest joy she weeps, hence we see that the Lyc. patient is a very nervous, sensitive, emotional patient. Here it is:
"Sensitive, even cries when thanked."
When lying in bed suffering from the lower forms of fevers, there is delirium and even un consciousness. He picks at imaginary things in the air, sees flies and all sorts of little things flying in the air.
"Excessively merry and laughs at simplest things." A condition of insanity.
"Despondent."
The Lyc. patient wakes up in the morning with sadness. There is sadness and gloom. The world may come to an end, or the whole family may die, or the house may burn up. There seems to be nothing cheering, the future looks black. After moving about a while, this passes off. This state precedes conditions of insanity, and finally a suicidal state comes, an aversion to life.
See how this remedy takes hold of the will and actually destroys man's will to live. That which is first in man is his desire to be, to exist, and to be something, if ever so small. When that is destroyed, we see what a wonderful thing has been destroyed. The very man himself wills then not to be. It is a perversion of everything that makes the man, the destruction of his will.
"Apprehensiveness, difficult breathing and fearfulness." "Anxious thoughts as if about to die."
"Want of self-confidence, indecision, timidity, resignation." "Loss of confidence in himself and in everything." "Misanthropic, flies even from his own children.” "Distrustful, suspicious and fault finding."
"Oversensitive to pain; patient is beside himself."
Head: Lyc. is subject to periodical headaches, and headaches connected with gastric troubles. If he goes beyond his dinner hour a sick headache will come on. He must eat with regularity or he will have the headache which he is subject to. This is somewhat like a Cactus headache.
Cactus has a congestive headache which becomes extremely violent with flushed face if he does not eat at the regular time. One distinguishing feature is that with the Lycopodium headache, if he eats something, the headache is better while the Cactus headache is worse from eating. Lyc. and especially Phos. and Psorinum have headaches with great hunger.
At or about the beginning of the attack there is a faint all-gone hungry feeling which eating does not satisfy. Such is the nature of Phosphorus and Psorinum when the appetite and headache are associated.
The Lycopodium headache is < from heat, from the warmth of the bed, and from lying down, > from cold, from the cold air, and from having the windows open. Lean, emaciated boys are subject to prolonged pains in the head. Every time this little fellow takes cold he has a prolonged, throbbing, congestive headache, and from day to day and from month to month he becomes more emaciated, especially about the face and neck. This same trouble is present when a narrow chested boy has a dry, teasing cough, without expectoration, and emaciates about the neck and face.
This remedy is especially suitable in these withered lads, with a dry cough or prolonged headache. In children who wither after pneumonia or bronchitis, emaciate about the face and neck, take cold on the slightest provocation, suffer with headache from being heated, have nightly headaches, and a state of congestion that affects the mind more or less, in which they rouse out of sleep in confusion.
The little one screams out in sleep, awakes frightened, looks wild, does not know the father and mother, or nurse or family until after a few moments, when he seems to be able to collect his senses and then realizes
where he is and lies down to sleep again. In a little while he wakes up again in a fright, looks strange and confused. That repeats itself.
The headaches are throbbing and pressing, as if the head would burst; but this is not so important as the manner in which they come on, the circumstance of their cause, the things that the child does and the fact that they are better from cold, worse from noise and talking, worse from 4 to 8 P.M., and he emaciates from above downward.
These are more important than the quality of the pain that the patient feels, but if he describes the quality of the pain it is spoken of as a throbbing, pressing, bursting or as a fullness.
Upon the scalp we find eruptions in patches, smooth patches with the hair off. Patches on the face and eczematous eruptions behind the ears, bleeding and oozing a watery fluid, sometimes yellowish watery.
The eczema spreads from behind the ears up over the ears and to the scalp. Lyc is a very important remedy to study in eczema of the infant.
Eczema ina lean, hungry, withering child with more or, less head trouble, such as has been described, with a moist oozing behind the cars, red sand in the urine, face looking wrinkled, a dry teasing cough, in a child that kicks the covers of a child whose left foot is cold and the other warm, with capricious appetite, eating much, with unusual hunger at times and great thirst, and yet losing steadily, will often be cured by Lyc.
It will throw out a greater amount of eruption at first, but this will subside finally and the child will return to health. The head in general is closely related to one symptom, viz., red sand in the urine. A long as the red sand is plentiful, the patient is free from these congestive headaches, but when the urine becomes pale and free from the red pepper deposit; then comes the bursting, pressing headache, lasting for days.
It might be said that this is a uraemic headache; but it does not matter what you call it, if the symptoms are present the remedy will be justified. In old gouty constitutions, when the headache is most marked, the gout in the extremities will be > and vice versa.
The headaches is present only in the absence of pain in the extremities. Again, when there is a copious quantity of red sand in the urine the gouty state, either in the head or extremities, will be absent, but whenever he takes cold the secretion seems to slacken up with an < of the pain.
There is another feature of the Lyc. headache related to catarrhal states. The headache is < when the catarrh is slacked up by an acute cold. The Lyc subject often suffers from thick, yellow discharge from the nose.
The nose is filled with yellow, green crusts, blown out of the nose in the morning and hawked out of the throat. Now, when the patient takes cold the thick discharge to a great extent ceases, and he commences to sneeze and has a watery discharge. Then comes on a Lyc. headache, with great suffering, with pressing pains, with hunger, and finally the coryza passes away, and the thick yellow discharge returns and the headache subsides.
We have many eye symptoms in Lycopodium, but most prominent are the catarrhal affections of the eyes. The symptoms are so numerous, they describe almost any catarrhal condition of the eyes, so that you cannot discriminate upon the eye symptoms alone. Inflammatory conditions with copious discharge, with red eyes, ulceration of the conjunctiva and lids, and granular lids.
Ears: For the ears Lyc. becomes an important remedy, because this selfsame emaciating child, with the wrinkled countenance and dry cough, has had, since an attack of scarlet fever, a discharge from the ears, thick, yellow and offensive, with loss of hearing.
If the suitable remedy be given in a case of scarlet fever, there will be no ear trouble left, because ear troubles do not necessarily belong to scarlet fever. They are not a part of scarlet fever, but are dependent on the constitutional state of the child. Lyc. has also most painful eruptions of the ears, otitis media, abscess in the ear, associated with eczema about the cars and behind the ears.
Nose: The nose symptoms I have only partly described in association with the head.
The trouble often begins in infancy. The little infant will lie at first with a peculiar rattling breathing through the nose, and finally it will breathe only through the mouth, as the nose is obstructed. This goes on for days and months. The child breathes only through the mouth, and when it cries it has the shrill tone, such as is found when the nose is plugged up. If you look you will see the nose is filled up with a purulent matter and hanging down the throat is a muco-purulent discharge. Much stuffing up of the nose is a chronic state of Lyc.
The child will go on with this trouble until it forms into great cruse, yellow, sometimes blackish, sometimes greenish, and the nose bleeds. It is most useful in those troublesome catarrhs associated with headaches; in such patients as lose flesh about the neck. It may seem strange and unaccountable that Lyc. can cause emaciation about the neck and shriveling of the face when the lower limbs are in a very good state of preservation. In old chronic catarrhs of adults they must keep continually blowing the nose.
He cannot breathe through the nose at night, as crusts form in all portions of the mucous membranes. Crusty nostrils with eczema, with oozing eruptions about the face and nose. The mucous discharge is almost as thick and tenacious as in Kalium bichromicum.
Face: The face is sallow, sickly, pale, often withered, shriveled and emaciated.
In deep-seated chest troubles, bronchitis or pneumonia, where the chest is filled up with mucus, it will be seen that the face and forehead are wrinkled from pain, and that the wings of the nose flap with the effort to breathe.
This occurs with all forms of dyspnoea. We see something like it in Ant. tart., the sooty nostrils being wide open and flapping. In Ant. tart. the rattling of the mucus is heard across the room and the patient is seen to be in distress, but if you see the patient lying in bed with the nose flapping and the forehead wrinkled, with rattling in the chest, or a dry, hacking cough and no expectoration, you will often find the particulars of the examination confirm your mind that it is a case for Lyc.
In that exsudative stage of pneumonia, the stage of hepatization, Lyc. may save the life of that patient. It is closely related in the period of hepatization to Phos. and Sulph.
The Sulph. patient is cold; there is no tendency to reaction; he feels the load in the chest, and examination of the chest shows that hepatization is marked. He wants to lie still and is evidently about to die. Sulphur will help him.
It does not have the flapping of the nose, nor the wrinkles upon the forehead, like Lyc. In the brain complaints of Stramonium, the forehead wrinkles, and in the chest complaints of Lyc. the forehead wrinkles, and their wrinkles are somewhat alike. You go to a semi-conscious patient suffering from cerebral
congestion and watch him; he is wild, the eyes are glassy, the forehead wrinkled and the tendency is to activity of the mind.
That is not Lyc. but Stram. By close observation these practical things will lead you to distinguish, almost instantaneously, between Stramonium in its head troubles, and Lyc. in the advanced stage of pneumonia.
The face is often covered with copper-colored eruptions, such as we find in syphilis, and hence it is that Lyc. is sometimes useful in old cases of syphilis, cases which have affected the nose, with necrosis or caries of the nasal bones, and the catarrhal symptoms already described. About the face also there is much twitching.
You will see by the study of the face that his face conforms to his sensations. lie is an oversensitive patient and at every jar or noise, such as the slamming of a door, or the ringing of a bell, he wrinkles his face. He is disturbed, and you see it expressed upon his countenance. He has a sickly wrinkled countenance, with contracted eyebrows in complaints of the abdomen as well as in chest complaints.
We also see that the jaw drops as in Opium and Muriaticum acid. This occurs in a state marked by great exhaustion and indicates a fatal tendency, It is especially marked in typhoid when the patient picks at the bed clothes, slides down in bed, wants almost nothing, and can hardly be aroused.
It is the expression of the last stage of the disease, a low type of fever, typhoids, septic and zymotic diseases. Under the jaw there is often glandular swelling, swelling of the parotid and submaxillary glands. The swelling is sometimes cellular and the neck muscles are involved. The tendency is to suppuration of these glands, and swellings about the neck in scarlet fever and diphtheria.
Throat: The next important feature we notice are the throat symptoms.
It was mentioned when going over the general state that the striking feature of Lyc. in regard to direction is that its symptoms seem to spread from right to left; we notice that the right foot is cold and the left is warm; the right knee is affected; if the pains are movable they go from right to left.
Most complaints seem to travel from right to left, or to affect the right side more than the left. This is also true of sore throats; a quinsy affecting the right side will run its course, and when about finished the left tonsil will become inflamed and suppurate if the appropriate remedy be not administered.
The common sore throat mill commence on the right side, the next day both sides will be affected, the inflammation having extended to the left side. This remedy has all kinds of pains in the throat and fauces. It is useful in cases of diphtheria when the membrane commences on the right side of the throat and spreads over towards the left.
Patches, will be seen one day on the right side and the next day on the left side. We have noticed also that complaints in Lyc. spread from above down, so it is with these exudations.
They often commence in the upper part of the pharynx and spread down into the throat. Lyc. has cured many such cases. It is the case sometimes that Lyc. is better lay holding cold water in the mouth, but the usual Lyc. sore throat is better from swallowing warm drinks. It is a feature whereby it is possible to distinguish Lachesis from Lycopodium. Lachesis is better from cold and has spasms of the throat from attempting to drink warm drinks, while Lyc. is better from warm drinks, though sometimes better from cold drinks. Lyc. does not sleep into the suffocation and constriction of the throat and dyspnoea as in Lach. The throat is extremely painful, it has all the violence of the worst cases of diphtheria. It has the zymosis.
Stomach and abdomen: The stomach and abdominal symptoms are intermingled.
There is a sense of satiety, an entire lack of appetite. He feels so full that he cannot eat. This sense of fullness may not come on until he has swallowed a mouthful of food; he goes to the table hungry, but the first mouthful fills him up. After eating he is distended with flatus, and gets momentary relief from belching, yet he remains distended. Nausea and vomiting; gnawing pains in stomach as in gastritis; catarrh burning in ulcers and cancer; pains immediately after eating; vomiting of bile, coffee ground vomit, black, inky vomit.
Under Lyc. apparently malignant cases have their life prolonged. The case is so modified that, instead of culminating in a few months, the patient may last for years. Right hypochondrium swollen as in liver troubles.
Pain in liver, recurrent bilious attacks with vomiting of bile. He is subject to gall stone colic. After Lyc. the attacks come less frequently, the bilious secretion become normal and the gall stones have a spongy appearance as though being dissolved.
Lyc. patients are always belching; they have eructations that are sour and acrid like strong acid burning the pharynx.
"Sour stomach,” sour vomiting, flatus, distension and pain after eating, with a sense of fullness. Awful goneness,” or weakness, in stomach, not relieved by eating (Digit. ).
The stomach is worse by cold drinks, and often relieved by warm drinks. In the stomach and intestines there is a great commotion, noisy rumbling, rolling of flatus as though fermentation were going on.
Lyc., China and Carbo veg. are most flatulent remedies and should be compared.
The stomach symptoms are worse or brought on from cold drinks, beer, coffee or fruit, and a diarrhoea follows. Old chronic dyspeptics, emaciated, wrinkled, tired and angular patients, everything eaten turns to wind. Lycopodium is useful in old tired patients with feeble reaction and feebleness of all the functions, with a tendency to run down and not convalesce.
This patient has most troublesome constipation. He goes for days without any desire, and although the rectum is full there is no urging. Inactivity of intestinal canal. Ineffectual urging to stool. Stool hard, difficult, small and incomplete.
The first part of the stool is hard and difficult to start, but the last part in soft or thin and gushing following by faintness and weakness. Lyc. patients have diarrhoea and all kinds of stool. So you will see from reading the text that the characteristic of Lyc. is not in the stool. Any kind of diarrhoea, if the other Lyc. symptoms are present, will be cured by Lyc. It has troublesome hemorrhoids, but they are nondescript. Any kind of hemorrhoids may be cured by Lyc. if the flatulence, the stomach symptoms, the mental symptoms, and the general symptoms of Lyc. are present, because the hoemorrhoidal symptoms are numerous.
Kidneys: The kidneys furnish any symptoms and may be the key to Lycopodium in many instances.
There seems to be the same inactivity in the bladder as in the rectum. Though he strain ever so much, he must wait a long time for the urine to pass. It is slow to flow, and flows in a feeble stream. The urine is often muddy with brick dust, or red sand deposits, or on stirring it up it looks like the sediment of fermenting
cider. We find this state in febrile conditions. In acute stages of disease; where the red sand appears copiously, Lyc. is often the remedy.
This is a very prominent symptom. In chronic symptoms when the patient feels best the red sand is found in the urine Lyc. has retention of urine and suppression of urine. It has "wetting of the bed" in little ones, involuntarily micturition in sleep, involuntary micturition in typhoids and low fevers.
A marked feature of Lyc. and one of the most prominent of all remedies, is polyuria during the night. He must arise many times at night and pass large quantities of urine, although in the daytime the urine is normal. Enormous quantities of urine, very clear and of light specific gravity.
Male sexual organs: One of the most prominent remedies in impotency.
Persons of feeble vitality, overwrought persons, overtired persons, with feeble genital organs, seldom need Phosphorus, but Lycopod. is a typical remedy where the young man has abused himself by secret vices and has become tired out in his spine, brain and genital organs.
If this patient makes up his mind that he will live a somewhat decent life and marries, he finds that he is impotent sexually, that he is not able to obtain erections, or that the erections are too feeble, or too short,
and that he is not a man.
Lyc. has inflammation of the mucous membrane of the urethra, with a gonorrheal discharge. It is anti- sycotic and has troublesome fig warts upon the male and female genitals.
"Moist condylomata on the penis, enlargement of the prostate gland."
Female sexual organs: It is a great friend of the woman in inflammation and neuralgia of the ovaries, and in inflammation of the uterus.
The neuralgia especially affects the right ovary, with a tendency to the left. Inflammation of the ovaries, when the right is more affected than the left. It has cured cystic tumors of the right ovary.
Lycopodium produces and cures dryness in the vagina in which coition becomes very painful. Burning in the vagina during and after coition. It has disturbance of menstruation. Absence or suppression of menses for many months, the patient being withered, declining, pale and sallow, becoming feeble.
It seems that she has not the vitality to menstruate. It is also suitable in girls at puberty when the time for the first menstrual flow to appear has come, but it does not come. She goes on to 15, 16, 17 or 18 without
development, the breasts do not enlarge, the ovaries do not perform their function.
When the symptoms agree Lyc. establishes a reaction, the breasts begin to grow, the womanly bearing begins to come, and the child becomes a woman. It has a wonderful power for developing, and in that respect it is very much like Calc. Phos.
"Discharge of flatus from the vagina."
"Varices of the genitals."
Chest: In the respiratory organs Lyc. furnishes a wonderful remedy.
Dyspnoea and asthmatic breathing in catarrh of the chest. The colds settle in the nose, but nearly always go into the chest, with much whistling and wheezing, and great dyspnoea.
The dyspnoea is worse from walking fast, after exertion and from going up a hill. Throbbing, burning and tickling in the chest. Dry, teasing cough.
Dry cough in emaciated boys. After coming out of pneumonia, the dry, teasing cough remains a long time or there is much whistling and asthmatic breathing.
The extremities are cold while whistling and face are hot, with much coughing and troubles in the chest. He wants to go about with the head uncovered, because there is so much congestion in the head.
This patient has a feeble reaction. There is no tendency to repair and the history of the case is that The troubles have existed since an attack of bronchitis or pneumonia. Besides the dry, teasing cough, Lyc. goes into another state in which there is ulceration, with copious expectoration of thick yellow or green muco- pus, tough and stringy. Finally night sweats, with fever in the afternoon from 4 to 8 o'clock, come on. Its use in the advanced stage of pneumonia, in the period of hepatization, with the wrinkled face and brow, the flapping wings of the nose and scanty expectoration, we have already spoken of.
Then it has marked catarrh of the chest with much rattling, especially in infants. Rattling in the chest flapping of the wings of the nose and inability to expectorate.
The right lung is most affected, or more likely to be affected than the left, or it is affected first in double pneumonia and troubles that go from one side to the other. Think of Lyc. among the remedies for neglected pneumonia, in difficult breathing from an accumulation of serum in the pleura and pericardium.
I have mentioned sufficiently the gouty tendencies of the limbs and the nerve symptoms. But there is a restlessness of the lower limbs and which comes on when he thinks of going to sleep and this prevents sleep until midnight.
Much like Arsenicum. It is often a very distressing feature. Numbness of the limbs. Drawing, tearing in the limbs at night; better by warmth of bed and motion. These pains are sometimes found in chronic intermittent fever and are cured by this remedy. Sciatica that comes on periodically, better by beat and walking. Varicose veins of the legs. One foot hot the other cold. Oedema of the feet.
It has all manner of fevers, continued intermittent and remittent. It is especially suitable in old age, and in premature old age, when a person at 60 years appears to be 80 years, broken down, feeble and tired.
It is eminently suited in complaints of weakly constitutions. It is suitable in various dropsies, associated with liver and heart affections. Scabs remain upon the skin, do not separate; they crust over and the crust does not fall, or may become laminated like rupia.
Sulphur, Graph. and Calc. are not longer acting or deeper acting than Lyc. These substances that seem to be so inert in their crude form come out strongest when potentized and form medicines of wonderful use.
Urines: You might naturally suppose that a medicine that has such a gouty nature in it would have more or less kidney symptoms.
"Urination frequent, quantity diminished or increased, stream often stops during the flow." "Burning in the urethra after urinating.” "Itching redness and discharge of pus."
It has red sand in the urine as marked as Lycopodium. It has great quantities of sandy deposit of various colors. When the patient is feeling at his best, there are great quantities of sandy deposits passing away. When there is little deposit in the urine, the gouty deposits in the joints become marked, and he does not feel so well.
It has another symptom that was verified by Lippe:
Copious clear, colorless urine, light in specific gravity and from its being light or deficient of salts in the urine we have an aggravation of the gouty manifestations.
Remember that the rheumatic tendency spreads upwards from the lower extremities, from the circumference to the centre.
"Menstruation too early, too profuse, bright red; absence of vital heat."
Genitals: Great coldness of the body at this time, yet the patient wants the cold air. Copious menstrual flow. Old gouty subjects, with mottled face with the puffiness that is not oedema, simply a venous stasis, with copious menstrual flow, with great pain during menstruation.
The uterus is extremely sensitive to touch, and the pelvic organs are. so sensitive that any deep touch becomes painful to the patient. Dysmenorrhoea in gouty subjects. It turns the constitution into order and prevents the after formation of gout. When such cases are very deep-seated, the uterine troubles will be cured in middle life, and the gouty appearance will come separately. The better the internal is, in an incurable disease, the worse the external becomes, and, when this is so the external trouble is essential to health, and so long as the external manifestations are in the extremities, and the joints are being increasingly affected, so long the internal is in a state of order.
When the remedy works in that way, do not change it and try to get something that will drive the external away. So long as the patient is improving and the external is growing worse, that is the right direction. Ledum acts in this direction. Its tendency is to make the complaints go away from the centre, for its complaints begin in the circumference and go towards the centre. It is sometimes impossible to manage a gouty patient without giving him some sort of explanation.
Lycopodium also keeps conditions coming to the surface. It will send them back to their own place in the externals when they have a tendency to go in. Lycopodium often causes a return of the red sand in the urine.
"Emaciation of suffering parts."
A nerve is injured by a puncture and a slight infection takes place, so that the wound becomes congested, with a mottled, oedematous appearance, and the part becomes cold, just such a condition as Ledum will
cure. The nerve that supplies that part takes on an ascending neuritis, pains shoot along the nerve, the muscles that are supplied by that nerve dwindle and the part withers. We have in Pulsatilla a similar state.
"The diseased limb withers."
Magnesia Carbonica
This remedy has only been partially proved, and comes to us now as Hahnemann lett it.
The mental symptoms and symptoms of some portions of the body and particulars have not been fully brought out. The remedy really needs reproving with high potencies upon sensitive provers that the finer shades may be understood. I would not speak of it but for the fact that it relates to a class of cases so very important that you will not be able to get along without it. It is related to the older and deeper psoric sickness. It is deep acting and long acting and permeates the economy as thoroughly as Sulphur.
General features: Some of the most striking general features are: Amelioration from motion; desire for open air, yet very sensitive to cold air; wants to be covered during all stages of fever; daily evening fevers; symptoms recurring every twenty-one days. Sensation of heat and even sweat from eating and drinking warm things; evening thirst.
Like other Magnesias it has most violent neuralgic pains, pains along the course of nerves, pains so violent that he cannot keep still, and he moves about and is relieved by motion. The provers felt these pains mostly in the head and face, but clinical experience has demonstrated that it has violent neuralgia everywhere.
Weare justified from the proving, in considering it as especially related to the left side of the face; neuralgia in the night; driving him out of bed, keeping him in constant motion. As soon as he stops moving the pain becomes very severe, shooting, tearing and cutting.
It has varied eruptions upon the skin; dry scaly, dandruff-like eruptions upon the skin, very unhealthy hair and nails. Particularly does it affect the teeth and roots of the teeth. In every change of the weather the roots of the teeth become violently painful, burn, shoot and ache continuously. Toothache before and during menstruation.
During pregnancy she suffers all the time with toothache, tearing pains in the left side of the face, although the roots of the teeth are perfectly sound. The hollow teeth are unusually sensitive, and painful. The teeth are so sensitive that they cannot be manipulated by the dentist.
This is like Ant. crud., but Magnesia carb. especially affects the roots of the teeth, while Ant. crud. affects the dentine more particularly. Sensitiveness of the teeth, so that he cannot bite upon the teeth, and the teeth feel too long. Magnesia carb, and China, when no other symptoms are present, are prominent remedies among the affections of the teeth during pregnancy.
There is a kind of marasmus that you will puzzle over if you do not know this remedy. If we analyze the remedy in general, we will see that it produces a state of the body like that prior to tuberculosis.
He does not undergo, repair, he loses flesh, and the muscles become flabby as if some serious disease were coming. In children of tuberculous parents there is that tendency to go into marasmus. The child's muscles are flabby, the child will not thrive in spite of feeding and medicines. It seems to be laying the foundations for some serious trouble.
Finally, it emaciates and the back of the head begins to sink in, as if from atrophy of the cerebellum. The appetite increases for milk and meat and animal broths, and yet they are not digested, and when the milk is taken it continually passes the bowel in the form of white potter's clay, or like putty.
The stool is soft and of the consistency of putty. If you go through a china factory where the men are forming with their hands, in such wonderful manner, all sorts of beautiful dishes, and moulds, you will see that the original clay, as they are manipulating it, is white. It is a perfect picture of the Mag. carb. stool, composed of putty-like undigested milk.
I have observed, especially among illegitimate infants, those that have been conceived by clandestine coition, that they have a tendency to sinking in the back of the head. The occipital bone will sink in, and the parietal bones jut out over it, and there will be a depression. That is not an uncommon thing in children that go into marasmus. They are very likely to have a potter's clay stool. It does not run, and it is not hard.
The white, hard stool is quite another symptom, and the soft semi-fluid white stool leads to another class of remedies, but this pasty stool, looking as if it could be moulded into any kind of shape, is a Magnesia carb. stool. I once had in charge an orphanage, where we had sixty to one hundred babies on hand all tho time. The puzzle of my life was to find remedies for the cases that were going into marasmus. A large number of them were clandestine babies. It was a sort of Sheltering Arms for these little ones.
The whole year elapsed, and we were losing babies every week from this gradual decline, until I saw the image of these babies in Magnesia carb., and after that many of them were cured.
The Mag. carb. baby smells sour like the Hepar baby.
Wash it as you will and it smells sour; the perspiration is sour, and the whole baby smells sour. It is not especially the stool. The stool smells strong and pungent putrid, and very often the whole child has a pungent odor, like an unclean baby, though it be well washed.
The Magnesias produce inactivity of the rectum and anus - a paresis. The stool is large and hard, requiring great straining to expel. It is dry, hard and crumbling. The stool will remain partly expelled and then crumble, breaking up in many pieces. Another stool that is laid down in the books as a most striking condition of Magnesia carb. is green; it is the diarrheic stool, and the green part floats upon the watery portion of the stool.
The stool is often lumpy, and liquid.
The lumps lie in the bottom of the vessel, but floating upon the liquid portion of the stool is the green like the scum of the frog pond. This is recognized as one of the most striking features.
"Stools green, like scum on a frog pond; sour, frothy; with white floating lumps like tallow, bloody, mucous."
Floating like lumps of tallow, is more characteristic of Phosphorus, and many a time has Dulcamara cured it.
The face of the chronic adult case is pale, waxy, sickly and sallow. and you wonder why this patient will not right up, and will not thrive. She has a sickly countenance, her muscles are lax, she becomes so tired and sweats upon little exertion.
She is disturbed in every change of the weather, and is worse at the beginning of menstruation, She seems to take cold whenever menstruation is coming on. She says:
"I know my menstrual period is coming on, because I have a cold in my head."
Magnesia carb. has coryza every month before. the monthly period.
These patients take on an appearance as if going into decline, and yet they go on year after year unable to do anything; not able even to keep house, have a violent craving for meat and an aversion to vegetable food, grow thin and increasingly flabby, muscles relaxed, and with tendency to prolapsus. The walls of the abdomen have a tendency to fall down and to be relaxed, and the rings favor the formation of hernia.
That is the kind of relaxation. The nerves are painful, and the muscles are tired. When you have such a case and have prescribed, and they persist in spite of every remedy, you know that the case does not well indicate a remedy, that the conditions are latent and there is a tendency to some grave internal disorder. The organs are threatening to break down; the kidneys, the heart, the lungs, or the brain are about to undergo organic change.
We have a catarrhal state in this remedy, but it is a dry catarrh, not much discharge. An old ulcer will dry up and become shiny and discharge almost nothing. The nose is dry and the eyeballs are so dry that the lids stick together and it is difficult to open the eyes. The skin becomes dry and itches and burns. Tendency to dryness of the mucous membranes and dryness of the skin. Dryness is a marked feature of this medicine.
"Inordinate appetite for meat in children.”
The stomach is a troublesome organ. The Magnesia carb. patient is always complaining of a sour stomach; sour eructations. Food comes up sour. There is nausea and coming up in the throat of sour food. Pains in the stomach after eating an ordinary amount of food; bloated after eating; much flatulence after eating. The stomach digests the food slowly and it becomes sour.
This remedy is especially useful if the history has been a tubercular one. Losing flesh and craving for meat in those who are tubercular, or in those, that are from tubercular parents.
Patients suffering from a dry cough.
Dry cough before the evening chill like Rhus tox. There are persons who have simply this tendency who go along year after year in this withered state, with the little hacking cough, not rousing up into much. Finally some favorable circumstance arises and the tuberculosis comes on rapidly after it has remained in a sluggish state for a long time.
There are a few remedies more likely to be associated with that condition than any others, Arsenicum, Calc. carb., Lycopodium, Magnesia carb. and Tuberc. They fit into this lingering state, this prelude to active phthisis.
They sometimes set a patient thriving, but mind you, these cases are hard cases to manage. They are difficult to find remedies for. Their trouble is so latent, the symptoms do not come out, and sometimes you have to read between the lines. They are the one-sided cases spoken of by Hahnemann.
In addition to this dry, tickling cough, which is not mentioned in the books, we find
"Cough, spasmodic at night from tickling in the larynx."
"Sleepiness during the day and sleeplessness at night."
When you have seen many of these cases that are threatening to go into phthisis, you will notice that it is a general feature with all of them.
"Doctor, I am so tired in the morning; while I sleep some in the night, in the morning I feel as if I had not slept."
Always tired and relaxed. Most of these subjects are cold and chilly. This, state has not been bought out yet in the remedy, but clinically it relates to cold and chilly patients. Patients who say that they have not much blood.
Magnesia Muriatica
It would seem rather strange that the two remedies to which Hahnemann gave such a good start by proving and use should be so neglected and forgotten as Magnesia carb. and Magnesia mur. have been.
These two, if used, would cure many of the liver troubles that are not now cured. Magnesia mur. could cure many conditions in nervous, excitable women that now go uncured. These remedies are neglected, while Phosphorus and Sulphur are prescribed for almost everything.
Magnesia mur. is a deep-acting antipsoric suited to nervous patients with stomach and liver troubles. it has enlarged glands and irritation of the nerve centres and brain. This patient is often sensitive to cold, chilly, but be desires fresh air and open air.
Many of the complaints are ameliorated by the open, fresh air, but come head symptoms are an exception. The head must be covered, as it is so sensitive to the open air. He is extremely restless; only with great difficulty can he keep still, and if forced to keep still, he becomes anxious. Anxiety is the marked feature. Restlessness, fidgetiness throughout the body, coupled with anxiety.
This comes on at any time, but it is worse at night in bed and still worse on closing the eyes to go to sleep. When he closes the eyes he becomes go anxious, restless and fidgety that he must throw the covers off, take a long breath or do something.
He is kept awake at night by the anxious feeling. It was described originally by the prover as an uneasiness, but in the Guiding Symptoms it is spoken of as a restlessness in bed. If you study the hysterical nature, the anxiety and restlessness, you will see it is throughout the whole economy and should be classed under mind and nerves.
Some remedies have vertigo on closing the eyes, some have anxiety on closing the eyes. Conium has sweat on closing the eyes. These were the points used by keynote prescribers and some times good results were obtained. I remember once curing an organic stricture, which had been dilated but was no better.
The patient described his symptoms and the stricture was all he could think of. I did not see his remedy and gave everything without relief. One day, however, he told me he could not close his eyes to go to sleep without having a profuse sweat. I gave him Conium on that keynote alone but it cured him of the sweat and the stricture, brought back an old gonorrheal discharge and resorption of the inflammatory material took place.
A scientific prescriber would not do that; but when he heard that symptom he would not know it was in the nature of Conium to have the stricture, and in another case he would see that Conium did not suit, and he would know when and when not to give it.
Anxious in the room, ameliorated in the open air. Anxiety at night in bed on closing the eyes. While reading she felt as if some one were reading after her and she must read faster and faster. That occurs in patients who are tired from being worked up to the highest pitch and it seems as if they would fly to pieces. Any thought that comes into the mind tends to repeat itself.
Vertigo, ameliorated walking in the open air. Vertigo in the morning on rising. The head symptoms are troublesome. Silicea will be given in cases where this remedy should be given, because the Silicea headache is ameliorated from wrapping up the head. This remedy has it also. Soreness of the hair follicles. Sensation as if the hair were pulled. Headache ameliorated from tying a bandage tight around the head or wrapping up the head.
Yellowness all over the body. Yellow eye in jaundice and liver troubles. Eyes inflamed. Margins of lids and eyelashes crusty; fine pimples and eruptions. After leaving the head symptoms, which are relieved by warmth, we find many symptoms worse in the warm room.
Pulsation in the ears. Ulceration of the edges of the nostrils. Tongue has the appearance as if it had been burnt, excoriated and cracked in various directions. Fissures hum like fire. Hunger but knows not for what. Ravenous hunger followed by nausea. Aggravation from salt things, from eating salt food, from salt baths, from sea bathing, and at the seashore from inhaling sea air.
Chest complaints, liver complaints and constipation at sea. Bromine has complaints of sailors when they come on shore. Magnesia mur. has complaints from going to sea.
When a patient has urticaria at the seashore, Arsenic will cure in Arsenic cases and will often mitigate when it is the only symptom.
Foul eructations tasting like rotten eggs. Disordered stomach. Stomach easily disordered. Waterbrash, vomiting. Like Magnesia carb., it has inability to digest milk. Milk causes pain, and it is passed undigested lienteric stools. Fainting at the dinner table in hysterical women.
It has many liver troubles. Enlargement and induration of the liver, with jaundiced skin. Right lobe of liver sore, painful while lying on it and when he turns over to the left he is uncomfortable, as it feels as if the liver dragged over to the left.
Natrum Sulph. often cures that symptom, and Ptelea has a somewhat similar condition. These two symptoms, aggravation from lying on the right, that is, the soreness, and aggravation from lying on the left, that is, the dragging; come separately or together. It has much liver trouble from lying on the liver.
Tenderness in the region of the stomach and over the bowels. Attacks of gastralgia in the evening, A strong feature in this remedy is indigestion. The stomach becomes less and less able to digest and finally he cannot take a mouthful of food without distress.
Abdominal dropsies. Colic, cramps, tearing pains. Great flatulence. With this kind of digestive disturbance we have a good home for tapeworm, it hatches out easily in this patient. The most troublesome patients I have are those who come after having had a tapeworm removed by violent drugs. It takes a long time to restore them. Ifa patient will come with his worm and all his symptoms, I will give him relief, and he will soon be turned into order and the tapeworm will cause no trouble.
Constipation of infants, as in Magnesia carb. Chalky stools like Magnesia carb. When the patient is an adult and yellow with jaundice, the stools are light colored, bileless and there is no expulsive, power.
No Power to expel the contents of the bladder, so he presses with the abdominal muscles on the full bladder and passes a little. Lack of sensation in the bladder, so that sometimes he cannot tell whether, he has to urinate or not until his bladder is so full that it causes pressure. The inability to feel extends to the urethra, and he cannot tell in the dark whether he is passing urine or not. Metrorrhagia, with backache which is ameliorated by pressing hard back in the chair or lying on a hard pillow. Bearing down pains in the pelvis, especially in hysterical women and girls.
Congestion of chest from sea bathing. Chest troubles and colds on the chest at the seashore and from salt baths. Palpitation of the heart with anxiety. Anxiety and restlessness come on at rest; he must do something, must hurry. These symptoms are likely to come on again in the evening when he tries to go to sleep.
Shocks through the body, like electric shocks, when wide awake, jerking the whole frame; twitching and jerking. Numbness in the extremities. Tearing pains in the upper limbs and marked restlessness in lower limbs. Cramps in calves at night. Paralytic drawing, and tearing in all the limbs. Burning of the soles at night in bed. Foot-sweat is another symptom like Silicea. Numbness of the arms in the morning on waking.
Hysterical and spasmodic complaints. Weakness from sea bathing or salt baths. It is the aggravation from salt. Sleep unrefreshing, anxious dreams. Bodily state sensitive to cold, and great disposition to take cold.
Some complaints are ameliorated by fresh air, if not too cold.
Magnesia Phosphorica
Magnesia phos. is best known for its spasmodic conditions and neuralgias.
The pains: are very violent and may affect any nerve. A pain localizes itself in a nerve and becomes worse and worse, sometimes coming in paroxysms, but becoming so violent that the patient becomes frantic.
The pains are ameliorated by heat and pressure. The patient feels better in a warm place; and his neuralgias are also better, he is miserable, and his pains are brought on when he becomes cold or is in a cold place. Pains are brought on from riding in the cold, and in cold, damp weather. Exposure for a long time to cold winds causes neuralgia of the face,
The pains are felt everywhere. Pain in the bowels, enteralgias, cramps in the stomach and bowels, with the same modalities. Pains in the spinal cord under the same rule - amelioration from heat. There are times when a nerve, in which there is considerable pain, becomes sensitive to pressure, becomes sore. The spinal cord becomes sore.
Convulsions, with stiffness of the limbs. Convulsions in adults or children, followed by extreme sensitiveness to touch, to wind, to noise, to excitement, to everything. Such convulsions, as children have during dentition. Colic; three months'colic, cramps, bilious colic.
But the special feature is its power to debilitate, to cause irritation of the nerves and muscles. Cramps from prolonged exertion. Stiffness numbness, awkwardness and deadness of a nerve from prolonged exertion.
Fingers: Thus it applies to long use of the hands and fingers in writing, and gives a fair sample of writer's cramp. It is especially useful in the cramps that come in the fingers, from writing, playing instruments and piano practice.
Pianists suddenly break down, with stiffness of the fingers, after several hours’ labor every day for years. The fingers give out. In playing the harp a cramp comes on and the fingers cannot perform their use. Other parts are affected in the same way from prolonged exertion. A laborer's hand will sometimes cramp and become almost useless. As soon as he undertakes to do that particular thing his hand cramps and he clutches the implement or loses hold. The carpenter after prolonged use of a tool has a cramp. This is a strong feature of the remedy in all sorts of over-exertion.
Violent cramps in dysentery and cholera morbus, that make him scream out. Twitching of the muscles all over the body, as in cholera. It was Schtiessler's main remedy for chorea, but we can only use it by its proving. Schtiessler prescribed it in all nervous conditions, but its proving justifies its use in neuralgia ameliorated by heat and pressure, cramps and twitchings.
Shooting pains along the nerves, but these are not so common as violent pains in paroxysms - a tearing pain as if the nerve were inflamed and put ona stretch. Shaking as in paralysis agitans and complaints resembling it. Amelioration from heat and pressure, and aggravation from cold, cold bathing, cold winds, cold weather, lack of clothing. Pains all over, but more likely pain located in one part.
Mind: The mental symptoms have not been brought out to any extent. It has been used clinically when diarrheas have ceased suddenly and brain troubles have come on. Congestion of the brain, but this is clinical.
Head: Neuralgia and rheumatic headaches ameliorated by heat. Excruciating pains. Violent attacks of headache ameliorated by hard pressure, heat and in the dark.
I have seen this mitigation of the symptoms in chronic congestive headache, when the face was red and there was throbbing, almost like Bell .; those headaches give way to Magnesia phos., when there is relief by heat and pressure. He wants the head. bandaged with a tight-fitting cloth, a warm room, and he is aggravated by cold.
Eyes: Spasms and jerking about the eyes, or prolonged tonic spasms producing a strabismus. Violent supra and infra-orbital pains with amelioration from heat and pressure. It has cured more face-aches than other pains.
Face: Neuralgia of the face, worse on the right side, and ameliorated by heat and pressure, and aggravated by cold. Tic douloureux. Chronic jerkings of the face. It favors rheumatic and, gouty subjects who suffer with neuralgia. It is a wonderful remedy for spasmodic hiccoughing. I have sometimes given Magnesia phos. for hiccoughing when I could not get any other symptoms to describe on.
Stomach and abdomen: Pain at the pit of the stomach. Spasms of the stomach with clean tongue. Colic ameliorated by doubling up, like Coloc., and ameliorated by heat.
The colic is not so markedly relieved by heat in Coloc., but is relieved by pressure. Distension of the abdomen and flatulence, with much pain. Radiating pains in the abdomen. Compelled to walk and groan from pain. Meteorism. It is said to cure cows of this condition. Colchicum will cure cows when they are distended with gas after being turned into clover patches.
Cutting, darting pains in hemorrhoids. If well proved we would probably have many liver symptoms, because both Magnes. and Phos. have liver symptoms.
Violent pains in acute rheumatism, ameliorated by heat. Neuralgic pains in the limbs. Rest relieves many complaints, and the least motion brings them on. Pains changing place.
Manganum
General features: Manganum is pre-eminently a drug that causes a species of chlorosis, and it is suitable for chlorotic girls, in broken down constitutions, waxy, anaemic, pallid, sickly, threatening phthisis, with necrosis and caries of bone and organic affections.
There is the history of a long period of scanty menstruation, or the menses have been delayed until the patient was eighteen or twenty years of age.
A strong feature is the great soreness of the periosteum, and especially of the shin bone. Tendency to ulceration and eruptions, and around these there is thickening and infiltration. Chronic eruptions; inveterate like psoriasis.
Small ulcers suppurate and infiltrate with purple hardness. It has a deep action, breaks down the blood corpuscles and lays the foundation for tuberculosis, especially in the larynx. Repeated attacks of laryngitis, each leaving the patient in a worse state than before. Tuberculosis that begins in the larynx. Aversion to food, no appetite, nothing will tempt him.
This, with great soreness over the body, lays the foundation for some deep complaint. It is not an acute periostitis, but a passive soreness all over. Inflammation of the joints and swellings go on to suppuration and necrosis.
Ulcerations and suppurative processes take on a quality of semi-malignancy and do not heal, presenting an erysipelatous appearance. Everywhere there is soreness to touch and soreness from jarring.
The bones are sore from walking. Arnica relieves only a day or two; but in this remedy it is deep-seated and prolonged, and we would not think of Arnica or Baptisia, which would only give relief for a day or so.
Vesicular eruptions, infiltrating, deep-seated, with tendency to crack and bleed. Roughness of the skin and psoriasis. Complaints worse in cold, damp weather and before a storm.
Mind: And now we will take up some, of the mental symptoms.
There are only a few of them, but they are striking, and these go deeper into the nature of the man himself, even than those we have been speaking about.
Anxiety and fear. Great apprehensiveness. Something awful is going to happen. Restless and anxious. He walks the floor, and the more he walks the floor the more anxious he becomes. He attempts mental occupation; tries to occupy his mind, and the more he does this, the more anxious he becomes.
He is tired and careworn. He cannot think; he cannot meditate. He has difficulties in his business because he cannot do good thinking. Anxious restlessness.
The queerest part of all is just how he gets relief. He lies down and it all passes away. You cannot- find that in every medicine; that is rare, strange and peculiar. And yet, see how general it is; it defines the whole nature of the sick man. His very life is excited, tired and anxious. Great sadness and distress.
He lies down and says, "Why did I not think of that before?"
Perfectly comfortable now. He gets up, and the anxiety and restlessness come over him again, and he is fairly driven to distraction.
See how unlike Rhus that gets relief from motion. See how unlike Ars. that is, the patient goes from one bed to another, from bed to chair and back again; he cannot sit still, or lie still, for his anxiety is worse keeping still.
See how striking these symptoms are, and see what a contrast we have. The very innermost life, of the patient is talking to us and asking for remedies. We must now read the signs and inner expressions of the disordered economy.
Then, he has these tormenting fears. Anxiety in the day time while moving about, better while lying. down. Sad, weeping and silent. Can think of nothing to console him but to lie down and get peace. Is it any wonder, then, that some of these patients are driven to a bedridden state? And Manganum is a wonderful remedy for bedridden women who love to keep still, and it is said of them that they love to lie in bed.
As far as we have gone we see that everything brings out that very idea and the nature of things that Hahnemann talks about in his first paragraph, that the sole duty of the physician is to pay his attention to the sick, to the patient himself; and who is this patient himself?
This is what we have been talking about, this is what we have been trying to bring out here; and all the particulars that I shall take up corroborate these very things. These particulars are so linked with, these generals talked about that they make a grand unity of thought, and we cannot separate them.
Irritability and low-spirited, like Sulph., and Graph. It is similar to Arg. met., Phos., Graph., and Sulph., in its underlying tendency to tuberculosis. Fretfulness from small things.
Head: Headaches as in anaemia.
Dreadful headaches; head feels heavy sticking pains; pressing, boring pains. Stitches, like needless. Aggravation from jarring on stepping. Soreness in the brain and skull.
Skull sensitive to touch and pressure. Red, sore spots here and there on the scalp (like Phos.), as if erysipelas would develop. Drawing, stinging headache in the open air, ameliorated in the house.
Other headaches are ameliorated in the air. Aggravation from a jar, motion, and change of temperature and in cold, damp weather.
Eyes: Agglutination of the eyelids.
It is a suppurative and catarrhal remedy. The eyelids are swollen. Aching of the eyes on looking at near objects, especially a near light. I have used this medicine often with that symptom and cured when there was pain in the eyes from sewing, reading fine print and doing anything that would concentrate vision.
Ruta in nervous, gouty constitutions, when there is pain in the eyes and complaints from sewing and reading fine print for a long time. Ruta is especially a remedy for artists who work with a magnifying glass.
Ears: Offensive discharges from the ear.
Dullness of hearing ameliorated by blowing the nose. Stopped sensation ameliorated by blowing the nose. Catarrh of the Eustachian tube. The external ear is painful to touch.
The ear symptoms arc numerous. It seems to many patients that all their troubles settle in the ears. All the pains and aches in the upper part of the body settle in the ears. The pains in the throat shoot to the ears.
There are pains in the throat, and pains in the teeth that go to the ears. Pains in the eyes that centre in the ears. That is strange. The ear is a centre of much tribulation.
"Catarrhal conditions, with increasing deafness." From cold, damp weather.
He is deaf whenever the cold rains conic in the fall. Then there is a soreness, rawness and burning in the auditory canal, with much itching.
Silica and Kali carb. are the two principal remedies for the paroxysmal cough that comes on from scratching the auditory canal. I have seen them choke and gag and vomit when they needed Kali carb. after scratching the auditory canal.
Spasmodic cough from scratching the auditory canal belongs principally to Silica and Kali carb. but Manganum has cured it. Itching in the ears from talking, from swallowing, from laughing, or doing anything that brings the throat into operation.
From talking, which is using the larynx. When the bolus p asses down behind the larynx is when it takes place. It is sometimes present in laryngeal phthisis, in chronic ulceration of the larynx, with burning,
stinging pains in the larynx that shoot to the ears.
In the proving of Manganum it is astonishing how many ear symptoms are recorded. And all these ear symptoms, like the others, are brought on, or increased, in cold, damp weather.
"Catarrh of the Eustachian tube." Obstruction. Feels as if the ears were obstructed. "Feels as if there were a leaf before the ear."
In cold, rainy weather: it strong feature running through the remedy is similar to Dulc., in that it is worse from cold, cold air, and cold damp weather.
His catarrh rouses up in cold weather. Every cold, damp spell causes hoarseness and the formation of mucus in the throat All of its complaints respond to the weather.
Wherever there is irritation there is great soreness. The eyes are red and sore. The throat is red and raw. Ear discharges are followed by great tenderness. Soreness and tenderness run all through.
Chronic catarrh. Nose stopped up. Discharge yellow, lumpy and green in the morning. Bloody discharge. The nose and cartilages sore. He avoids handling the nose.
No medicine will give you a sicklier face. When persons have bled out and have become waxy and pale the routinist thinks of China, but when there has been no bleeding and this same state is present from, breaking down of the blood corpuscles Manganum is to be thought of.
Chlorosis and pernicious anaemia would make one think of Manganum, and also Picric acid and Ferrum. Small wounds suppurate; every bruise remains sore for a long time. There is not much bleeding, for there is not much blood.
Infiltration is in keeping with this remedy. I have seen it cure inveterate ulcers, indurated and purple, in anaemic patients. Old "fever sores” can be cured with this remedy. Squamous eruptions.
Stomach: All sorts of stomach disorders.
Indigestion. Want of appetite. Drawing in the region of the stomach. Colic. All of these are worse from cold, damp weather. The pains are ameliorated from bending double. It is a very useful remedy for warding off tabes mesenterica, anaemic constitution, no appetite, diarrhoea, pain in the bowels, and, as the patient emaciates, the glands are felt.
Useful in women who have been anaemic for some time from loss of blood, but it is not so great a remedy for anaemia following haemorrhage as for that condition result ing from destruction of the blood corpuscles.
Dreadful flushes of heat like Psor. Lach., Sulph. and Graph., coming on in women who have been anaemic for some time.
Liver: it is also a great liver remedy.
There is congestion and tumefaction of the liver. It has cured a tendency to fatty degeneration. It has cured jaundice; it has cured many cases of gall stone; which means that the liver goes into such a sluggish state that the bile is unhealthy, the flow is impeded, and then little nodules form in it, and from gall stones.
It establishes a better working order of the stomach, a better working basis of the liver, the bile becomes healthy, and gall stones are dissolved in healthy bile. Gall stone colics are likely to occur along with gall stones.
The abdomen: may be said to be full of rumblings, and there are frequent griping pains and these come on in cold, damp weather.
They come on from eating cold food, like iced foods. Cold things create much distress in the region of the liver. Distress in the stomach, and distress through the bowels.
"Pain and contraction at the navel" something like Plumbum, although it is not said to draw like a string at the navel, like Plumbum and Platinum.
"Passes much flatus with the stool. Irregular action of the bowels."
There may be periods of constipation, interrupted with every indigestion, causing diarrhoea so that the bowels are always irregular. He is never quite safe, he has constipation or diarrhea. As we might suppose, the stomach is the faulty organ.
"Cramps in the anus while sitting. Better lying down." Females: It is a useful remedy for those flashes of heat that occur at the climacteric period.
The chlorotic state mentioned is closely related to the menstrual state. Disorders of the uterus, and of the stomach.
Very scanty menstrual flow. It lasts but a day or two, and it comes too soon. This is unusual in anaemic conditions, unusual in chlorosis. In women past the turn of life, every little while there will come a little hemorrhage, a little watery flow.
Anaemic old ladies, with a little watery flow from the uterus. We have had in the past to rely mostly on Calcarea for the old ladies with hemorrhages of the uterus.
Weare not surprised with all these weaknesses if we have muscular relaxation, and it is true in Manganum with these tired, weakly, anemic women; and also there is prolapsus of the uterus and prolapsus of the rectum. A dragging down of the intestines, and the whole abdomen feels heavy from a state of relaxation.
The region most threatened is the larynx, trachea and lungs. Larynx: If this anemic girl does not improve and get up a better reaction something serious will happen.
Menstruation is merely a pale fluid or a little leucorrhea. Rawness of the larynx. Hoarseness and loss of voice in a chronic state. It is suitable in recurrent cases coming with every spell of damp weather until finally tuberculosis starts.
Every cold starts up additional trouble in the larynx, causing a laryngitis. It is a wonderful remedy in speakers and singers, as useful as Argentum met.
Constant accumulation of mucus, more forms as soon as he clears it. Hemming all the time and annoying everybody. Arg. met., Sil., Sulph., Phos. and Manganum, all do that. Each hem brings up a mouthful of mucus.
Tubercular laryngitis. Rawness in the larynx. Expectoration of green mucus, great anemia. Every spell of cold, rouses up a bronchitis, like Dulc. Cold, dry weather sometimes relieves, but the patient is sensitive to cold; he is chilly and anemic,
The cough is ameliorated by lying down. Most coughs are worse from lying down, and few remedies have amelioration from lying. In Euphrasia there is a cough coming from coryza, especially acute coryza in vigorous persons, and the cough is better while lying.
Again there is a nervous spinal cough in spinal subjects, nervous girls, who have a cough as soon as they lie down, which is cured by Hyos.
This remedy has a day cough, no cough at night because he is lying. Arg. met. has a day cough; like Manganum it refers to the larynx, and is ameliorated by lying down. Cough worse from talking, laughing, walking, deep inspiration and cold, damp weather.
This remedy is most useful in recurrent complaints, and is hardly ever seen in first attacks. It is of great use in patients who are gradually declining. Ulceration and bleeding in the lungs. The hemorrhage is watery, like bloody saliva or bloody mucus. The patient grows nervous, tremulous and has palpitation.
The limbs are full of distress, even to gout. Sore bones, burning in soles, arthritic enlargements, painful periosteum, some joints. It has not rapid inflammatory rheumatism, like Puls. and Bell., but tenderness of the joints, with not much swelling and aggravation from damp weather, like Rhod., Rhus and Dulc.
This remedy does not usually come up in fevers, but in cases of low typhoid, after the fever has somewhat abated, the bones are sensitive, sore all over, the patient does not rally, there is prolonged convalescence, especially in badly treated cases, who have been drugged until the blood corpuscles are ruined.
You would think if he could only start up a big abscess he would be better, but be has not vigor enough for that.
Some of these patients have "fever sores," and this acts as a seton and relieves them; but this patient cannot develop one, only the periosteum is sore and infiltrated.
Medorrhinum
Children: One of the many uses of this remedy is in the inherited complaints of children.
The physician of long and active experience meets many obstinate cases in children. The infant soon emaciates and becomes marasmic, or a child becomes asthmatic, or suffers with vicious catarrh of nose or eyelids, or has ringworm on the scalp or face, or is dwarfed; and after some waste of time it comes to mind that the father was treated for gonorrhea that was obstinate and perhaps had condylomata on the genitalia.
This remedy will cure, or begin the recovery. The woman married several years desires to become a mother. She was healthy when she married, but now she has ovarian pains, menstrual troubles, she has lost all sexual response, is growing pale and waxy, and becoming violently sensitive and nervous.
The husband's history gives the cause, and this remedy will cure. The pale waxy young men, who crave stimulants and tobacco, who are sensitive to drafts, become stiff after exertion and walking, who perspire easily and are extremely sensitive to cold, who have never been well since having a gonorrhea cured by injections.
Rheumatic symptoms: in every part of the body. Some symptoms are worse in the daytime. The usual comparison with Syphilinum, which reads,
"Med. in daytime and Syph. at night," does not hold good as a sweeping statement. It is true that many Syph. pains are worse nights.
It is true that some sycotic and Medorrhinum symptoms are worse daytimes. It is also true that many sycotic symptoms are violent day and night. It is also true that the mental symptoms of Med. are most violent at night. It will not do to be too sweeping with circumstances of this nosode.
The rheumatic inflammations are worse from motion, but where swelling is not present these patients act like Rhus patients; they are sensitive to cold, suffer from aching and torturesome pains, and find relief only in motion - like Rhus. Most sycotic patients suffer from cold, some are sensitive to heat.
Sore, bruised and lame, as if he had taken a deep cold and was coming down with a fever. The pains come on with a feeling of general tension. Obstinate cases of rheumatism. Losing flesh.

Nose: This remedy cures obstinate nasal catarrh, also post nasal obstruction with loss of smell. Mucus, white or yellow. A middle aged man was cured of an obstinate nasal discharge by Med. very high and a discharge from the urethra which had been suppressed many years before came back and acted like a
chronic gleet, and finally subsided without other treatment.
Bleeding from the nose, and bloody nasal discharge. Nose sensitive to inhaled air. Itching and crawling in nose.
The greenish yellow, waxy, sickly face of the sycotic patient looks like that of the Arsenic patient, but strange to say, Arsenic does not otherwise correspond to the symptoms, but may be mistaken for it. The skin shines, and is often covered by blotches and there are fever blisters about the mouth. Herpes on the
face.
Epithelioma of wing of nose, or on lip. Rheumatic pains and stiffness of face. Swelling of the submaxillary glands.

A young man who had been in good flesh and health took gonorrhoea. He was treated by injection. Soon he began to lose flesh. He suffered from pain in the groin, which compelled him to walk bent. He became pale and waxy; stiff and lame all over, and was very sensitive to cold.
Took cold frequently, which seemed never to get quite well. After Med. very high the discharge returned, and he seemed quite well. Pain in spermatic cords.
Infants: This remedy has cured many cases of marasmus in infants that had inherited sycosis from a parent.
Children of a sycotic father are especially subject to attacks of vomiting and diarrhoea, and emaciation. They resist well selected chronic remedies, or are only palliated by well selected remedies. After Med. high they thrive, and remedies act better.
Stools: Constipation.
Can pass stool only by leaning far back when straining at stool. Inactivity of the rectum. Round balls, and hard lumpy stool. Oozing of moisture at the anus, smelling like fishbrine.

Respiration: is difficult.
Suffocation and short breath on slight exertion. Asthma in children of sycotic parents (Nat. s.). Spasms of the glottis with clucking in the larynx; air expelled with difficulty, but inhaled with ease. Several cases of asthma have been cured by this remedy. Dryness of the larynx causes spasms and cough on falling asleep.
Most obstinate catarrh of air passages with copious viscid expectoration has been cured by this remedy. Cannot cough deep enough to reach the phlegm (Caust.). The cough is ameliorated by lying on the abdomen, is aggravated at night. The expectoration. is yellow, white or green, viscid, difficult to raise. Cough worse in a warm room.
Many of the patients that need this remedy look sick, pale, and walk stooped as if about to go into phthisis. Dry cough, with rattling in chest. Great heat, even burning in chest. Many pains in chest. Rheumatic, sharp pains through chest on exposure to damp cold air.
When patients who have suffered from gonorrhoea seem to be taking on a phtisical complex of symptoms and the paucity of individualizing symptoms makes the remedy doubtful, this remedy will bring better reaction, and sometimes be the remedy for many months.
Intense pain in chest on coughing. Sensation of coldness in chest and mammae. Stitching pain in chest. The chest is sore to touch, and aggravated by the motion of breathing.

Mercurius
General features: The pathogenesis of Mercury is found in the provings of Merc. viv. and Merc. sol., two slightly different preparations, but not different enough to make any distinction in practice.
Mercury is used in testing the temperature, and a Merc. constitution is just as changeable and sensitive to heat and cold. The patient is worse from the extremes of temperature, worse from both heat and cold. Both the symptoms and the patient are worse in a warm atmosphere, worse in the open air, and worse in the cold.
The complaints of Mercury when sufficiently acute to send him to bed are worse from the warmth of the bed, so that he is forced to uncover; but after he uncovers and cools off he gets worse again, so that he has difficulty in keeping comfortable. This applies to the pains, the fever, ulcers and eruptions and the patient himself.
He is an offensive patient. We speak of mercurial odors. The breath especially is very foetid, and it can be detected on entering the room; it permeates the whole room. The perspiration is offensive; it has a strong, sweetish, penetrating odor. Offensiveness runs all through; offensive urine, stool and sweat; the odors from the nose and mouth are offensive. When Merc. is used in large doses and the patient is salivated he gives off these odors.
One who has once smelt a salivated patient will remember the mercurial odor. | remember when I was a student, almost every room had the mercurial odor. Mercury was given till the gums were touched and salivation was produced. That odor is often an index to the use of Merc.
He is worse at night. The bone pains, joint affections and inflammatory conditions are all worse at night and somewhat relieved during the day. Bone pains are universal, but especially where the flesh is thin over the bones. Periosteal pains, boring pains, worse at night and from warmth of the bed.
The glands are inflamed, and swollen; the parotids, sub-linguals, lymphatic glands of the neck, groin and axilla are all affected; the mammae swell and there is inflammation and swelling of the liver. It is pre- eminently a glandular remedy. Induration is also a general; inflamed parts indurate. If the skin is inflamed it is hard. Inflamed glands are hard.
There is induration with ulceration. A tendency to ulcerate runs through the remedy. Ulcers are found everywhere, in the throat, nose, mouth, and on the lower limbs. Ulcers sting and burn and have a lardaceous base, an ashy-white appearance looking as if spread over with a coating of lard. It looks like a diphtheritic exudate, and Merc. has diphtheritic exudations on inflamed surfaces.
Ulcers in the throat have this appearance. The mucous membrane sometimes inflames without ulceration, but with exudation, and hence it is useful in diphtheria. It has the same condition in ulcers; when the system is run down they exude a grey lardy or ashy deposit. Chancres take on that form, a whitish cheesy deposit on the base. When you realize that the complaints of Merc. are worse at night, and think of the bone pains, periosteal inflammations, etc., it is not surprising that Merc. sometimes cures syphilis. It is wonderful that the allopath hit upon it for this disease, and he cures or suppresses enough cases by similarity to justify its continued use. When given suitably it cures.
Another marked feature is the tendency to the formation of pus. With inflammation there is burning and stinging and the rapid formation of pus and the part is aggravated by both warmth and cold. Abscesses burn and sting; inflammation of joints is attended with pus formation; in inflammation of the pleura the cavity fills up with pus. The discharges of pus are yellow-green. The Merc. gonorrheal discharge is thick greenish-yellow, with stinging and burning in the urethra.
Rheumatic inflammation of joints and catarrhal inflammation of mucous membrane are features running through the remedy, and these are attended with sweat, and an astonishing feature is that the sweat does not relieve, and there is even an aggravation while sweating.
Rheumatism in old syphilitic, gonorrhoeal and gouty patients. It is similar enough to relate to some cases of psora, syphilis and sycosis. It partakes of the nature of all three miasms.
After a prover has taken Merc. a long time he emaciates. This is seen in old mercury takers and in syphilitics who have been mercurialized. It is a great remedy in this condition-steady emaciation with trembling, worse at night and from the warmth of the bed, great restlessness, can't find peace in any position. These miserable wretches, who are breaking down, are great sufferers, whether psoric, syphilitic or sycotic.
A strange feature is repeated swelling and abscess formation without any heat. An abscess or swelling in a joint forms, and he sweats from head to foot, is worse at night, loses flesh, trembles and is weak, but there is no heat while the abscess goes on. Abscesses form when the life force is so low that there is no tendency to repair; a slow and prolonged pus formation, no irritability in the abscess, no tendency to granulate, it opens and keeps on discharging and seems dead. Merc. will warm it up, stop the sweat and favor granulation.
The superficial ulceration is inclined to spread and become phagedenic; it is not deep but grows larger. These open ulcers are especially seen in old syphilitics; lardaceous base; not much irritability, they are even numb, and if pus is discharged it is greenish-yellow; false granulations appear. Merc. cor. is a greater remedy for the superficial, eating, phagedenic ulcer.
At times Merc. takes on a gangrenous condition. This may be seen anywhere, but especially on the lips, cheeks and gums. Cancrum oris. Gangrenous chancre, foetid and black; a sphacelus forms in the chancre and the part sloughs off. All these conditions are aggravated by beat.
A patient with a typical Merc. abscess rebels at times against the poultice, for it makes the trouble worse.
Trembling runs through the remedy, quivering all over. It has been used with benefit in paralysis agitans. Tremor of the hands so that he cannot lift anything or eat or write. Merc. is a great remedy in children with
epileptiform fits, twitching and disorderly motions. It will help children to grow out of these in coordinate angular movements of the hands and feet.
Jerking, twitching and trembling. The motions of the tongue are disorderly and the child cannot talk. Convulsions. Involuntary motions which can be momentarily controlled by volition. The restlessness is extreme.
The trembling, weakness, sweat, foetor, suppuration and ulceration, the aggravation at night and from heat and cold, give the earlier impressions of the remedy.
Mind: The mental symptoms, which still more deeply show the nature of the medicine, are rich.
A marked feature running all through is hastiness; a hurried, restless, anxious, impulsive disposition. Coming in spells, in cold cloudy weather, or damp weather, the mind will not work, it is slow and sluggish and he is forgetful. This is noticed in persons who are tending toward imbecility. He cannot answer questions right off, looks and thinks, and finally grasps it. Imbecility and softening of the brain are strong features.
He becomes foolish. Delirium in acute complaints. From his feelings he thinks he must be losing his reason. Desire to kill persons contradicting her. Impulse to kill or commit suicide; sudden anger with impulse to do violence. She has the impulse to commit suicide or violent things, and she is fearful that she will lose her reason and carry the impulses out. Impulsive insanity, then, is a feature, but imbecility is more common than insanity.
These impulses are leading features. The patient will not tell you about his impulses, but they relate to deep evils of the will, they fairly drive him to do something. Given a Merc. patient, and he has impulses that he tries to control, no matter what, Merc. will do something for him. During menses, great anxiety, great sadness. Anxious and restless as if some evil impended, worse at night, with sweat.
Al these symptoms are common in old syphilitics, broken down after mercurial treatment and sulphur baths, at the springs, with their bone pains, glandular troubles, sweating, catarrhs and ulcerations everywhere.
Head: Merc. is suitable to rheumatic troubles of the scalp, and neuralgias and brain trouble when there are burning, stinging pains and pains affected by the weather, and when there are head troubles that have come on from suppressed discharges, such as suppressed otorrhoea after scarlet fever, or when there are head troubles in scarlet fever.
Think of Merc. if you are called to a child with sweating of the head, dilated pupils, rolling of the head, and aggravation at night, who has had scarlet fever or a suppressed ear discharge. Merc. cures lingering febrile conditions analogous to the typhoid state, but caused by suppressed ear discharge. I have cured cases that were due to packing the ear with borax, iodoform, etc., the patient having first a remittent and later a continued fever.
This would go on for five or six weeks and be relieved only when the discharge returned after a dose of Merc. I remember a case of this type. It was called cerebro-spinal meningitis; the head was drawn back and twisted and held to one side.
It began as an otitis media with discharge which was suppressed. Two or three doctors were called and could do nothing. In the night I went to the bedside and got the history and symptoms of Merc. Merc. re-
established the discharge in twenty-four hours, the torticolis passed away, the fever subsided and the child made an excellent recovery. I can recall many such cases.
There is a tension about the scalp as if it were bandaged. Nervous girls have headache over the nose and around the eyes as if tied with a tape, or as if a tight hat were pressing on the head. Pressing, tearing pain in the eyes. Burning pains in the temples ameliorated by sitting up and moving about, worse at night.
Periosteal pains worse in cold, damp weather, in rheumatic and gouty constitutions, with sensitiveness in the eyes and ears, sore throat and glandular swellings. Headaches in old mercurialized syphilitics; they become barometers; sensitive to the weather. The catarrhal headaches are very troublesome; headache in those suffering from chronic catarrh with thick discharge.
The thick discharge becomes watery and the pain in the forehead, face and ears very distressing. These headaches are violent. Chronic rheumatic headache from the suppression of a discharge from any part, or from foot sweat suppressed; alternation of foot sweat and headache. When the foot sweat is gone he has pain and stiffness in the joints.
Silicea has that also. Sil. and Merc. do not follow each other well, when well selected; but if crude Mercury has been taken for a long time, Silica, like Nitric acid, is a good remedy to eliminate it when the symptoms agree.
With all headaches there is much heat in the head. Bursting headaches, fullness of the brain, and. constriction like a band. Vise-like pressure. He is sensitive to the air when he has headache. This is true of Merc. all through. He is relieved in the room, but worse in a warm or cold room, and violently worse from a draught. He wants to be covered but is worse from heat. The hoop-like sensation is worse at night.
Merc. is a wonderful remedy to ward off acute hydrocephalus after measles and scarlatina; the child rolls the head and moans, and the head sweats. It is closely related to Apis, which is also a great remedy after scarlet fever to ward off or cure hydrocephalus. Exostoses in old syphilitics.
Lacerating, tearing pains in the pericranium.
The whole external head is painful to touch. The scalp is tense and sore. Foetid, oily sweat on the head. Children have moist eczema, an excoriating, offensive eruption.
Eyes: Merc. is a wonderful eye remedy, especially for "colds."
Every cold settles in the eye in gouty and rheumatic patients. Catarrh of the eyes worse from looking into the fire or rather from sitting close to the fire; the radiated heat causes smarting. Eyelids forcibly drawn together as if long deprived of sleep. Fog or mist before the eye. Merc. cures iritis in syphilitics.
The rule now-a-days is to use a mydriatic in iritis to prevent adhesions. I have treated many cases and I have no desire to dilate the pupil. I believe it is unnecessary. The homoeopathic remedy will stop the iritis speedily so that no adhesions will form, and if they have begun the remedy will remove them. Pains tearing and burning around the eyes, in temples, etc. Tension of the scalp as if it were a tight fitting cap, or tension as from a tape.
Ulceration and inflammation of the cornea. Vascular appearance of the cornea; inflammation, especially confined to the cornea, sometimes pustular, sometimes diffused. There is copious lachrymation with all eye symptoms, and the tears excoriate, causing a red line down the cheeks. Greenish yellow, or a green
discharge. Lids spasmodically closed. Great photophobia. In inflammatory conditions of all the tissues of the eye lids, conjunctiva and deeper structures. Colds settle in the eye like Dulc.
Sometimes you will see a little fine growth on the iris, growing across the pupil and attached by a pedicle. It is really a syphilitic condylomata. Merc. cures it in a few days. Inflammation of the retina and choroid and of the optic nerve. All sorts of disturbed vision. It is useful in purulent ophthalmia, with swollen lids. Two kinds of constitution need it, the syphilitic and the rheumatic or gouty. He can not open the eyes; they are spasmodically closed, and there is great tumefaction.
Ears: Ear troubles. Horribly stinking greenish discharge. Green, thick, acrid pus from the ears like the discharge from the nose and other parts. Stinking otorrhoea. In otitis media with ruptured drum, Merc. is a frequently required remedy. In Spring after a long, cold Winter, the cold, damp weather causes many cases of otorrhoea; it is almost endemic in large cities. The ear drum heals like any other place if the patient is put in good condition by the remedy. It not well treated a hole will be left. Ears inflamed, with cramp-like pains.
Merc has stinging pain like Apis. All routinists will give Apis for stinging pains, and yet it often is Merc. that the patient needs. Purulent, offensive otorrhoea. Enlargement of the parotids and cervical glands with all inflammations of the ears. Parotids sore and enlarged, neck stiff, and head sometimes drawn back., Furuncles in external canal. Fungous excrescences and polypi.
The nose troubles would take a long time to describe.
Old syphilitics, with nasal bones affected, thick, greenish, yellow, acrid, stinking discharge. Nosebleed and bloody discharge from the nose. Coryza acrid, watery, with pressure through the bones of the face, worse from heat or cold, worse at night; sensitive to every draught; must get up and walk the floor. It has coryza with much sneezing with an opposite state, ameliorated lying, not at all during the night while lying in bed, only in the daytime while up and about.
The inhalation of hot air feels good to the nose, but the heat aggravates the body. Incessant sneezing. Bleeding, scurfy, red nostrils. Old catarrhal smell in the nose. Rawness, burning and swelling. Inside of the nostrils smarting and burning. Aching, tearing and pressure in the bones. Bones of the face painful, feel as if pressed outward, and be wants to press, but it is painful.
Merc. is not deep enough to cure the whole constitution in psoric cases that are constantly taking cold. It cures the cold at once, but implants its own nature and the patient catches cold oftener. It should not be given often, not oftener than twice in a winter. Kali iod, is better for the same burning in the face, running coryza, and aggravation from heat and warmth of the bed, and it will cure the coryza in a night when apparently Merc. is indicated. it is also an antidote to Merc. Don't give many doses of Merc. in psoric cases; look for a deeper medicine.
Face: It has syphilitic eruptions and neuralgias of the face with or without catarrh. It is a great medicine for mumps; it is a routine remedy for this condition, which shows that it must be frequently indicated. It cures where the symptoms agree.
Scorbutic gums in those who have been salivated. Rigg's disease; purulent discharge from around the teeth. Toothache; every tooth aches, especially in old gouty and mercurialized patients. Looseness of the teeth. Red, soft gums. Teeth black and dirty. Black teeth and early decay of the teeth in syphilitic children, like Staph. Copious salivation.
Gums painful to touch. Pulsation in the gums and roots. Gums have a blue red margin, or purple color, and are spongy and, bleed easily. Gums settle away, and the teeth feel long, and are elongated. Teeth sore and painful so that he cannot masticate. Abscesses of the gums and roots of the teeth.
The taste, tongue and mouth furnish important and distinctive symptoms. As the tongue is projected it is seen to be flabby, has a mealy surface, and is often pale. The imprint of the teeth is observed all round the edge of the tongue. The tongue is swollen as if spongy, and presses in around the teeth and thus gets the
imprint of the teeth. Inflammation, ulceration and swelling of the tongue are strong features.
Old gouty constitutions have swollen tongue; the tongue will swell in the night and he will waken up with a mouthful. The taste is perverted, nothing tastes right. The tongue is coated yellow or white as chalk in a layer. Offensive mouth; putrid odors from the mouth especially the mercurial odor of the salivated patient. The tongue becomes clumsy; difficulty in talking; his speech is hardly intelligible. Awkwardness of the tongue as in persons intoxicated. Ulcers flat; eating ulcers; holes are eaten through the cheek. Eating away of the soft palate and the bone of the bard palate is often eaten away.
Purulent formation in the antrum of Highmore and fistulae from the mouth to the antrum. Fluoric acid and Silicea are more frequently indicated in these fistulae, especially if the bone is involved. Copious flow of foetid saliva. Sore mouth of children and nursing mothers; little aphthous patches with the mercurial odor and flabby, spongy appearance of the mucous membrane and tongue. General diffused inflammation of the mouth. The whole mucous membrane is sensitive and painful, burning, stinging and smarting; dryness with or without aphthous patches. Thrush of children. Scorbutic gums.
Throat: Sore throat. It is a remedy for inflammation of the throat, with spongy appearance, general diffused tumefaction swelling of the parotids, fullness and stiffness of the neck. Lardaceous base in ulcers; flat ulcers, spreading ulcers. Great dryness in the throat. The swelling impairs the motion of all the' muscles that take part in swallowing.
Swallowing is attended with difficulty, pain and paralytic weakness, and the effort to swallow forces the bolus up into the nose, and liquids come out through the nostrils. The mercurial odor is a strong feature, but Merc. often cures when that odor is not perceptible; it has such an affinity for the throat. it has chronic throat troubles and syphilitic ulcers and patches.
The inflammation extends upwards and downwards, red and pale patches, the red looking as if they would suppurate or ulcerate. The red spots become quite purple, but the more purple they are the more they are like Lach. Tonsils dark red with stinging pains. Quinsy, after pus has formed. It is useful in diphtheria, and most cases are diffused, extensive patches or patches here and there, with spongy appearance, but no ulceration. Tumefaction; and the exudations are upon a tumefied base. Stiff neck. Erysipelatous inflammation of the throat. Dark, sloughing, eating, corroding ulcers in the throat.
Stomach: He has aversion to meat, wine, brandy, coffee, greasy food, butter.
Milk disagrees, and comes up sour. Sweets disagree. He is turned against his beer. The stomach is chronically disordered; eructations, regurgitations, heartburn, etc. Sour stomach; it is foul. He has nausea with vomiting and regurgitation of food. In such a stomach food is like a load. Bad taste; bitter mouth; be tastes the food; it comes up sour.
With all this the saliva constantly runs from the mouth. It does not improve as digestion goes on. The half- digested substances are vomited. It is like the state in persons who have destroyed their stomach from crossing liquors, beer, wine and whisky.
Liver: The liver furnishes much trouble.
Our forefathers for years took blue mass every Spring to regulate the liver. They physicked themselves with it and tapped their liver every Spring with it, and as a result they had worse livers than they would have had if the doctors had stayed at home. Constipation, bilious habits and disordered stomach.
The fullness in the region of the stomach, coming in spells, worse in cold, damp weather and warm, damp weather, worse in the Spring, jaundiced condition, disordered stomach, the aggravation at night and from the warmth of the bed, nightly feverishness and foul mouth, will give you the Merc. state.
Stitches in the liver. Liver symptoms worse lying on the right side. Many complaints of Merc. are aggravated by lying on the right side. The lung symptoms and cough, liver, stomach and bowel symptoms are all worse while lying on the right side.
Abdomen: In the abdomen we find colic, rumbling, distension, aches and pains, stinging and burning.
It has a great variety of stools, of diarrhoea and constipation. It has a well-defined dysenteric condition. Slimy, bloody stools with much straining, he feels as if he could never finish, even when no more is passing, a "never-get-done" feeling.
This is the very opposite of Nux and Rhus in dysentery. These are relieved if a little stool is passed, but Merc. and Sulph. will sit and strain, and all the salts of Merc. have the same state. Merc. cor. has a more violent attack, with violent urging to stool and to urinate, and intense suffering, with burning in the parts and the passage of pure blood.
Merc., Ipec. and Acon. are frequently indicated in epidemic dysentery that comes in hot weather, and Ipec., Dulc. and Merc. are frequently indicated in the dysentery of cold weather.
You should go to the bedside of a case of dysentery with the repertory or go home and send medicine. Your first prescription should cure in epidemic dysentery, and if you work cautiously you will cure every case. It is a very simple condition to cure, but a very bad thing to get mixed up. Do not give Arsenic just because it conforms to the dysenteric condition, for if it does not cure it will mix up the case. Hesitate about giving Ars. in dysentery until you are perfectly sure it is indicated.
A few days ago I saw a patient who could not lie down because, of pain in both hypochondria; he had incessant vomiting, inflammatory rheumatism of the ankles, hands, arms and shoulders, he had purpuric spots on the arms and legs, he had inflammation of the stomach, and was a perfect museum of diseases. He had had Phos. and Ars. and many remedies very high, all supposed to be well selected but Cadmium sulph. put him to sleep in fifteen minutes.
The point was that he wanted to keep perfectly still, and hence it was unlike Ars., although all the other symptoms were like Ars.
That is a strong feature of Cadmium sulph; he wants to keep as still as Colch. and Bry. For many years I have used it for such cases. I saw another case of cancer with coffee-ground vomit, and Cadmium sulph. stopped her vomiting, and she ate quite well until she died six weeks later. The doctor in charge had given her Ars. and Phos. and Morphine till she could take no more.
Urines: The urine burns and smarts.
Frequent urging to urinate, dribbling a little; bloody urine, great burning. Haemorrhage from the urethra. Itching worse from the presence of urine. Gonorrhoea which has existed for some time; discharge thick, greenish-yellow, and offensive. Smarting and burning in the urethra when urinating. Loss of sexual power.
Genitals: Lascivious excitement with painful erections.
Ulcers on the prepuce and glans, making it suitable in chancre and chancroid. Flat ulcers; ulcers with lardaceous base. Inflammation of the inner surface of the prepuce. Balanitis, offensive pus. In chronic balanitis when pus forms behind the glans and under the foreskin, gonorrheal or psoric, consult jacaranda caroba.
The woman has much tribulation. Burning, stinging in ovaries. Screaming from pain. Stinging, tearing, cutting pains in the ovaries, patient covered with sweat. Copious, excoriating leucorrhoea, parts raw, sore, inflamed and itching.
Stinging, itching and boring pains in the uterus. Pains in the uterus and ovaries at the menstrual period. Milk in the breast of the non-pregnant woman at the menstrual period. Milk in the breasts instead of the menstrual flow. I once had a freak in a sixteen-year-old boy, who had milk in his breasts. I cured him with Merc.
Menstrual flow light red, pale, acrid, clotted, and profuse or scanty. The menses are sometimes suppressed. Women who have been in the habit of taking mercury for biliousness remain sterile. (Coffee drinkers often remain sterile also and you must stop their coffee.)
Amenorrhoea with ebullitions. Chancres on the female genitals. Aged women have denuded genitals, rawness, soreness and false granulations, which are always bleeding. Burning, throbbing and itching in the vagina. Itching of the genitals from the contact of the urine; it must be washed off.
In children, boys or girls, the urine burns after urinating and they are always carrying the hands to the genitals. Little girls have acrid leucorrhoea causing burning and itching and much trouble. Phlegmonous inflammation of the genitals. Boils and abscesses at the menstrual period; little elongated abscesses along tho margin of the mucous membrane and skin, painful, aggravated by walking, forming during the flow and breaking after the period. This with itching, causes great suffering.
Morning sickness. A woman, while pregnant, has oedematous swelling of the genitals. Diffused inflammation, soreness and fullness of the genitals and pelvis, causing difficulty in walking, and she must take to bed.
In pelvic cellulitis in the early months of pregnancy Merc. is an important remedy. Repeated miscarriages from sheer weakness Merc. is a wonderful strengthener when properly used. Prolonged lochia. Milk scanty and spoiled.
Merc. is one of the best palliatives in cancer of the uterus and mammae. It will restrain and sometimes cure epithelioma. I knew one case cured by the Proto-iodide, an ulcerated, indurated lump in the breast, as large as a goose egg with knots in the axilla, blueness of the part, and no hope.
The stooth attenuation, given as often as the pains were very severe, took it away and she remained well. The effect observed on the nose is not all of the Merc. coryza.
Respiratory: Most Merc cases begin in the nose and travel down the throat, creating rawness and scraping of the larynx, and rawness and soreness in the chest; laryngitis, tracheitis and bronchitis.
Loss of voice, complete aphonia. The course of the Merc. cold is downwards, even going on to pneumonia, with sweat, restlessness and aggravation from the warmth of the bed. Of course many of the colds remain in the nose.
There are various conditions in the chest. Coughs; colds that remain in the chest, lack of reaction and tardy recovery. The colds finally settle in the bronchial tubes; the chest feels as if it would burst and the cough is worse lying on the right side. I look back over many cases of patients who took cold from exposure and now look sickly and sallow, with a dreadful cough and rattling on the chest; every change of the weather gives them a new cold, and they cannot lie on the right side; their tendency is to go into mucous phthisis or quick consumption.
The cough is worse in the night air. There are many pains in the chest. He has a rheumatic constitution, is always sweating, worse while sweating and from the extremes of heat and cold. Stitching stabbing, rheumatic pains in the chest with night sweats. Bloody, thick green expectoration. Suppuration of the lung, great quantities of pus form.
Tremendous orgasms, bubbling and flushes of heat in the chest. With many complaints there is sore throat and rheumatism and stiffness of the neck; stiff neck with swollen glands and goitre. Stiff neck with every cold; stiffness of the side and back of the neck. Induration and soreness of the cervical glands along with other complaints.
Limbs: Merc. especially affects the joints; inflammatory rheumatism with much swelling, aggravated from the heat of the bed and from uncovering.
It is difficult to get just the right weight of clothing. Rheumatic affection with sweat, aggravation at night, from the warmth of the bed and while sweating, with sickly countenance. It especially attacks the upper limbs, but is also found in the lower.
Tremulous condition of the extremities, like paralysis agitans. Trembling of the hands with great weakness. Paralysis of the lower limbs, and twitching, jerking and quivering of the paralyzed parts. Arg. n., Phos., Stram., Secale and Merc. have twitching of the muscles of the paralyzed limb.
Soreness between the thighs and genitals. Ulcers on the legs; abscesses. Oedematous swelling of the feet. Cold perspiration. Copious sweat during sleep. Pain and sweat come on when comfortable in bed; bone pains. He covers up because he feels cold, but when he becomes warm the pains are aggravated.
Fever: Merc. is full of fever. Very seldom, however, has it a true, idiopathic, continued fever. It stands very low for continued fever alone, but it is especially indicated in surgical fevers, at first remittent, but later continued, such as come on from the suppression of discharges.
The Merc. patient about to go into a chill is chilly even when the chill has not yet come on; sensitive to the moving air in a warm room; violently sensitive to a draught. Cold hands and feet. The sweat is profuse and offensive.
The complaints in general are worse while he sweats, and the more he sweats the worse he is. He sweats copiously and his greatest sufferings are in the sweat. Merc. does not have a clear intermittent.
Between the paroxysms be has liver disturbances, diarrhoea, fever. In surgical fevers, bilious fevers, worm fever in children, and remittent fevers there is much aching in the bones, great sensitiveness to the air, aggravation at night in bed when the fever runs highest, mercurial breath and sallow skin. The fever does not go so high. and the skin is not so hot as in Bell. The loaded tongue and the bilious fevers fade out after Merc.
It is useful in hectic fever in the last stages of consumption, and in exhausting diseases with hectics, and in cancer when there is the aching, foul sweat, etc. It acts wonderfully in catarrhal fever, grippe, etc., and when colds extend to the chest and there are the copious discharges everywhere. It is suitable in quasi-typhoids that have come out of remittents, symptomatic typhoids, when the patient is icteric, low, prostrated, tremulous, with quivering muscles, great exhaustion and continued fever.
Skin: There are many skin symptoms; scurfy eruptions, vesicular eruptions, eruptions discharging pus.
Vesicles burn and smart, with excoriating discharges, especially on the head. Much itching of the skin, violent, in all parts of the body, as from fleas, especially when warm in bed at night. Copper-colored eruptions as. in syphilis, and mucous patches. The scurfy eruptions are especially marked.
Ulcers on parts where the skin and flesh are thin over the bones. Offensive forms of eczema. Most eruptions are moist with copious oozing. It cures shingles.
The skin is sallow. Excoriating wherever two parts come together. Rawness between the thighs and between the scrotum and thighs. Eruptions in such places. it has fissures at commissures, at the corners of the
mouth and eyes; rawness and bleeding of the perineum rendering walking difficult.
This furnishes a basis for the Salts of Mercury.
The salts of mercury: After studying Merc., corrosive mercury, the proto-iodide and the bin-iodide, we may from some specific symptoms in the case say that we prefer one of the salts of Mercury.
When we go to rheumatic and gouty cases with the aggravation from sweat, aggravation from the warmth of the bed, the mercurial odor, etc., we can commonly say that one of the Mercurius will cure this case.
Mercurius Corrosivus
Merc. cor. has more excoriation and burning, more activity and excitement.
Merc. is slower and more sluggish. Merc. cor. is violent and active in its movements, it takes hold and runs its course with greater activity. So with a mercury base we have often to prefer this salt.
In the eye symptoms there is more excoriation. The pains, burning, smarting, etc., in the eruptions and ulcers are more violent. In Merc. we have slow spreading ulcers, but in Merc. cor. there is great eating; it will spread over an area as large as your hand in a night. He has the mercurial odor and sweat, and he is sallow; he needs mercury, but a more active preparation than Merc. viv.
Merc. cor. has decided symptoms of its own, but they are limited. You cannot tell the ptyalism, or the lardaceous ulcers apart.
In sore throat, if it is a Merc. case, the ulcers are spreading rapidly and burning and smarting like coals of fire, you would say that Merc. is not so intense as this. You need Merc. cor. for the violence, the intense burning, and the rapid spread. The throat is enormously swollen, the glands are swollen, and the thirst is
insatiable.
In dysentery there is more violence; copious bleeding; great anxiety, can scarcely leave the stool a second, great tenesmus of rectum and bladder; urging to urination and stool is constant; great burning in the rectum. It is a violent case of dysentery. I would prefer Merc. in ordinary Merc. cases, but if this patient is not relieved he will not live, and Merc. cor. is needed here.
In the urinary organs the symptoms are violent. Albuminuria is more marked in Merc. cor. than in Merc. It is one of the most frequently indicated remedies in the albuminuria of pregnancy and a very useful remedy when gout is present.
From slight irritation of the foreskin of the male organ, the mucous membrane and skin contract and phimosis takes place.
Merc. cor. relieves the itching and burning, and causes the purse-string to let up. It is seldom indicated in gonorrhoea, but is called for when there is greenish yellow or bloody watery discharge, with violent burning and urging to urination and to stool, and violent painful erections. Chancres spread with great rapidity.
Stitching, rending, tearing pains, here and there, especially in the chest.
Mercurius Cyanatus
Given a Merc. base and diphtheria, when the membrane is greenish and inclined to spread through the nose and involve a large surface, the Cyanide of Mercury is needed.
It has exudation more marked than any other form of Mercury.
Malignant forms of diphtheria, rapidly forming, and with phagedenic ulceration.
Mercurius Iodatus Flavus
(Proto-iodide of Mercury.) There are sore throats that especially call for the proto-iodide. When in sore throats the inflammation and pain predominantly affect the right side, and there is a
tendency to remain on the right side, or if the Merc. state is present and the sore throat goes from right to left, it is the proto-iodide you want.
The patient that needs this remedy for constitutional troubles will be worse during rest and from a warm room and better in the open air.
This is especially true when the patient needs Merc. prot. in neuritis of the right arm that comes on in writers.
The arm then is very painful when writing, from passive motion, from rubbing, from pressure, from both beat and cold, but better from walking in the open! air.
Complaints are nearly all worse on the right side of the body.
Mercurius Iodatus Ruber (Bin-iodide of Mercury.)
Again, if in a Merc. patient with diphtheria, tonsillitis, etc., the inflammation and pain begin on the left side, and incline to remain there or spread to the right, the bin-iodide is indicated.
These two iodides have more rapid and greater induration beneath ulcers and chancres than Merc., and in old syphilitics the iodides are sometimes more useful.
Mercurius Sulphuricus
(Sulphate of Mercury. Turpeth mineral.)
Merc. sulph. will sometimes help, when you have a case of hydrothorax with quick, short breathing, etc., and burning of the chest.
If you go to an old case of hypostatic congestion, with dropsy, or a case of dyspnoea from hydrothorax, when the Merc. base is present. you will be astonished at the action of this sulphate.
Mezereum
The principal use of this remedy is in eruptions and ulcerations.
The most violent and important of its symptoms are those of mucous membranes, skin and periosteum. The outer surfaces of the body are in a constant state of irritation; nervous feelings, biting, tingling, itching, changing place from scratching. Even when there is nothing to be seen, there is violent itching and the patient rubs and scratches until the part becomes raw and then burns; itching changes place; the part becomes cold after scratching, cold in spots. Itching changing place after scratching, especially when associated with no visible cause.
As soon as he gets warm in bed or as soon as he goes into a warm room, the itching begins. Formication, itching, biting. The patient is so nervous that he is compelled to move, to change positions.
Vesicular eruptions upon the skin, running a certain course, itching, burning like fire; dries into a crust and disappears; a new crop appears near or in the same place. Vesicles form crusts beneath which is ulceration; these crusts turn white, chalk-like, are thick, tough and leathery.
They are often elevated; fluctuation beneath the crusts; pressure causes thick, white pus, sometimes yellow- white, to ooze forth; violent itching. The pains are aggravated by cold, but the itching and restlessness are worse from beat. A child tears. at the eruption with its fingers when the crusts are present.
Scald-head; thick, white, elevated crusts; copious, white or yellow white pus, often offensive, putrid; vermin are often found among the crusts. Acrid pus eating away the hair; the eruption spreads to any part of the scalp, especially to the top; it is also found beneath the ears, and about the face and chin.
Eruptions with much itching; dark, red rash with violent itching, biting, tingling, crawling, changing place by pressure, rubbing or scratching. Cases with a history of suppressed eczema or syphilis. Eruptions upon the legs and arms, on parts with poor circulation as the ears, wrists, backs of the bands; skin eruptions followed by ulcers; discharging a thick, white, offensive matter.
Especially useful where eruptions have been suppressed by zinc ointment, mercurial salve, etc. Eruptions on the face, eyes, ears and scalp in child or adult, which have disappeared under the use of some ointment and inveterate catarrhal conditions have resulted, or in which eye symptoms have developed; conjunctiva chronically swollen, ectropion, granular lids, conjunctival surfaces like raw beef; fissures in the comers of the eye; red cicatrices about the eyes where the eruptions have been; dry spots and enlarged veins about the eyes and nose; skin feels indurated.
Ear troubles from suppressed eruptions; thickening of the mucous membranes of the ears; degeneration of the drum of the car; deafness, otorrhoea.
Offensive and troublesome catarrh of the nose; incrustations, thickening of the mucous membrane, ulceration; he hawks thick, yellow matter out of the throat; has been cauterized, atomized, etc., and yet the offensive ozoena remains. The periosteum is affected so that it breaks down. Advanced state of atrophic degeneration of the mucous membranes of the throat and nose.
In the throat, thickening, burning, chronic redness, tumefaction, smarting, soreness on swallowing; granulations and ulcerations of the throat.
Perforating ulcers of the soft palate, all due to suppressed eruptions. Give the remedy and you will have a copious eruption in the original place; if not, there will be no relief. Often the deafness cannot be cured, because the drum of the ear or the whole ear is destroyed, is white, chalky, and contains no blood-vessels; a state of atrophic catarrh, so that there is too much structural change for hearing to be restored, yet the patient can be cured.
Has all the catarrhal states, the ulcerations and patches of copper colored eruptions found in syphilis.
When outward manifestations are pronounced, its internal manifestations are scanty. It tends to manifest the sufferings of the body on the skin; it throws the physical evils to the surface, hence, the Mez. patient is in fairly good health when the eruptions are out; when they are suppressed, then catarrhal affections, bone diseases, nervous disorders, strange mental symptoms constipation, rheumatism, and joint symptoms appear; he becomes a mental wreck.
Religious or financial melancholy; melancholy which shapes itself upon the patient's business; indifference to everybody and everything; irritable; thought is difficult; memory weak; absent minded; has no rest when alone, yet averse to talking. Insanity with melancholy, sadness, and a history of eruptions that have called for Mez.
Violent headaches and brain affections; pains rending, tearing; boring; head painful to touch; syphilitic affection of the brain; headaches through the sides of the head as if in the bone; feels as if the head would be crushed (closely related to Merc. and Kali iod.).
Headache extending from the root of the nose to the forehead (Merc. and Hepar). Pains in the head cause faintness (Hepar). Pains in the bones of the skull aggravated by touch; bones feel as if scraped.
The hair mats together.
"Head covered with thick, leather-like crusts, under which thick, white pus collects here and there, and glues the hair together.
Scabs on the head look chalky and extended to the eyebrows and nape of neck. Elevated, white, chalk-like scabs with ichor beneath, breeding vermin."
Neuralgias, sciatica, pain in the spine, in the brachial plexus and down the arms; neuralgia of the face; all following suppressed eruptions.
The Mez. patient is sensitive to warm air as far as the skin and. eruptions are concerned, but very sensitive to damp or cold weather as to the neuralgias. After the eruptions have given place to internal manifestations, the patient is chilly, sensitive to the changes of the weather, worse in stormy weather; worse after a bath, because he takes cold and his internal complaints are aggravated. The eruptions are aggravated after washing.
When the eruptions are not out, the skin is hot and he wants something to cool it; he is better from cool water; there is simply a redness at this time. The itching is aggravated from bathing in warm water.
Ulceration about the roots of the teeth; a scrofulous condition of the gums, which bleed, settle away from the teeth; the teeth decay suddenly.
The face is sickly, full of ulcers, old scars, boils, etc. The anaemic face may flush up at times, but it is usually pale, gray, and waxy, expressive of a cachexia met with in some bone diseases.
Sensation of goneness, fear, apprehension, faintness in the stomach, as if something would happen; every shock, pain and hearing bad news, cause this apprehensive, hungry, faint, weak, all-gone feeling in the pit of the stomach. It comes on when the door-bell rings, if the patient is expecting the postman, while waiting at the depot for the arrival of a friend or the departure of the cars; on being introduced to sonic one, he experiences a thrill beginning in the stomach is "frightened in the stomach."
Cal., Kali carb., Phos. and Mez. have this. These "solar-plexus" individuals often have a deep cracked tongue and are hard to cure.
Worse from the warmth of the bed (hence related to Merc. and syphilis). Neuralgia worse in bed and at night, relieved by the external application of heat, but worse afterward; better in the open air.
Inflammatory rheumatism, worse from the warmth of the bed and at night; worse from touch; pains run down the bones; bursting sensation in the bones. They feel enlarged; tearing pains in the periosteum, necrosis, caries, fistulous openings discharging briny particles and large ulcers surrounded by pustules.

Orgasm of blood about heart.
Moschus
Mind: Moschus cures many hysterical girls who have come to adult age without ever learning what obedience means.
They are self-willed, obstinate and selfish. When they have been encouraged to resort to crafty cunning, to have every whim gratified from infancy to eighteen years of age they become fit subjects for Mosch., Asa f, Ignatia and Valer.
They not only have volumes of real and imaginary symptoms, but they become adepts at producing at will a kaleidoscopic complex of symptoms, increasing in quantity and intensity until all their own desires are attained, and the onlooker, be he or she nurse, physician or bewildered mother, is overwhelmed, dismayed and in retreat.
However much they pretend to be honest and truthful their reported sensations are untrustworthy. They have traded upon their sensations and imagination so long that a direct effort to give a truthful statement is unsuccessful. The most erratic and unexpected neuropathic phenomena are always in appearance.
The physician cannot measure these cases by his experience and say what is common and uncommon. He is compelled to fall back upon the one word that covers a multitude of these manifestations, viz., "Hysteria."
Moschus is often indicated in these constitutions and cures much that is morbid, when its own peculiar symptoms agree. When one of these girls becomes sick from taking cold the acute symptoms will be told with a host of her imaginary sensations.
The globus hystericus is generally present, hyperesthesia of the skin, quivering of the muscles, wakefulness, palpitation, excitement, fainting and trembling.
"Dreadful" pain all over the body, rush of blood to head, cramps in hands and feet, convulsions of whole body. It is not generally known that the morbid sensations and functions correspond with the mental state of the individual. When the functions and tissue symptoms are hysterical or erratic the mental state will be found to be correspondingly hysterical.
When the peculiar Moschus symptoms of the face is present, viz.: one cheek red and cold, the other pale and hot, there is certainly some hysterical perversion in the mind of that patient.

Muriaticum Acidum
When treating a low form of continued fever with extreme prostration Arsenicum, Muriatic acid and Phos. acid force themselves upon the mind.
With Arsenicum there has been the anxious restlessness; with Phos. acid there has been the mental prostration, and then the muscular weakness; with Muriatic acid the muscular weakness comes first, and there has been history of restlessness and the mind has been stronger than could be expected.
With this great muscular exhaustion with jaw hanging down and the patient sliding down in bed and soon the involuntary stool and urine, this remedy is forced upon the mind. Paralytic weakness is what it must be called.
Soon the tongue is paralyzed, as well as the sphincters of the bladder and rectum. It seems to be eminently fitted for the lowest forms of zymotic fever when the above symptoms are present, He finally becomes unconscious.
There has been some restlessness, but nothing like Arsenicum and Rhus tox. He refuses to talk because it frets him to do so. Phos. acid is slow answering questions because of exhaustion of mind which makes him unable to think.
The vertigo comes on moving eyes, and on lying on the right side. This vertigo is sometimes associated with liver disease. A stout, full blooded jaundiced man about forty had suffered much from pain in the liver, with great soreness, was comfortable only when lying on left side; when he turned on his back or right side an anxious vertigo would come at once and he would break out in copious sweat, and be forced back to the left side.

Naja The use of Naja has extended far beyond its proving.
So many of the Ophidian family present symptoms in common with it, that much has been presumed truly so.
Many characteristics run through these remedies, each remedy having its own peculiar sphere. Taken together the family presents a wide range of curative action.
Mure, of Brazil, thought that the snake family presented curative powers for the healing of the nations.
In the mineral kingdom, man may find his remedy when sick, so in the vegetable and animal kingdom. It is possible that the product of the serpent may be everything needed for the healing of man. Extend this to the whole animal kingdom and it is probably so.
There seems to be everything existing in one kingdom that exists in another. The lowest is the mineral, the next the vegetable, and last the animal kingdom. If we had a perfect knowledge of any one kingdom, we could probably cover the entire scope of curative possibilities. But we have only a knowledge of a few remedies in each kingdom.
Another idea has been advanced that in any particular region, the vegetable kingdom provides all that is necessary for curing in that region. If we were acquainted with all the vegetable growths, how much we would know in comparison with what we do know!
It is highly probable that there is a throwing off from the sick human race of something that is absorbed by the plants, The evils that are thrown off by man may be absorbed by the vegetable kingdom. Plants will correspond to men in the region in which they grow, if there is anything in this.
In two thousand years there might be a necessity for some kind of a check upon the growth of plants. The absorption of these evils may cause them to vary in species, and if they continue to grow and each to absorb the evils from the human race, they will continue to differ. This favors evolution and explains it in a sense.
It is important to compare the symptoms of Naja with those of the other snakes. The patient is disturbed by closeness of the collar, < after sleep.
There are exhaustion and trembling, trembling, of the muscles. Its direction is somewhat like Lach., from left to right,, i. e., the ovarian pains, the diphtheria, the joint affections go from left to right.
Naja, like Lach., is < in damp weather. On inflamed surfaces it produces grayish exudations. It does not partake so, extensively of this character as do Lach. and Crotalus. There is only a shadow of the septic in Naja, but it is extensive in Lach. and extremely marked in Crotalus. Naja is not as subject to haemorrhage as either Lach. or Crotalus.
There is trembling of the muscles, a rheumatic diathesis, and tendency of all complaints to settle about the heart. It is used in valvular troubles of the heart, in young persons who grow up with cardiac valvular diseases. The whole trouble settled about the heart. This suggests Naja, and Naja has often cured.
If the valvular trouble is congenital it can not be cured, but if not, it shows that all the disturbing forces have settled about the heart. All the symptoms have settled about the heart; Naja has this. In school boys
and girls who have no symptoms this is the generic remedy for this kind of complaint. Always prescribe Naja unless guided away from it by some specific symptom.
Naja has more nervous, Lach. more septic symptoms. Naja, marked agitation without sepsis, Lach., all the nervousness. with a tendency to hemorrhage and sepsis; black blood, like charred straw; dark clotted blood.
Naja has surging of the blood upwards, like Lachesis - a distressing symptom. There is marked dyspnoea, cardiac or otherwise. There is stuffing up of the chest; great rawness of the trachea and larynx, the whole passage is raw as if excoriated.
There is much sneezing, with running of water from the nose; inability to lie down at night; dryness of the air passages of the nose, hay fever. The patient has suffocative attacks in August.
The whole chest is in a state of congestion; emptiness of the left side of the chest; low pulse or intermittent pulse. With all the complaints of the chest there is inability to lie on the left side. Numbness of the left arm. There is dyspnoea; if he goes to sleep, he wakes up suffocating, gasping, choking or he starts. from sleep as if from a dream. In most complaints there is inability to lie on the left side.
There is a dry, hacking cough with sweating in the palms of the hands that is cured by Naja. These cardiac cases are often attended by a dry, hacking cough, a cough with every little exertion. It is not catarrhal state, nor is it tubercular. The heart beats slowly and will not be urged to work, and a cough comes on from exertion. Cactus also has a cardiac cough.
The extremities are cold and blue and the head hot. The head symptoms are < in a warm room; the head feels warm, fevered, yet the feet and limb do not become warm. There is copious sweating of the hands and feet causing the gloves and shoes to rot out; but the sweat is not offensive.
There is a sense of fullness and puffiness of the hands and feet, showing a slow circulation in the veins which we might expect.
We might naturally expect that this patient would be intense and excitable, which is the case. There is a suicidal tendency.
The headaches are nondescript; of a congestive character all over the head, especially in the occiput. Headaches accompanied by a quick and nervous pulse.
Profound sleep is consistent with all the makes. There is deep, profound sleep with stertorous breathing.
She wakes with a headache every morning. It is natural for the Naja headache to be present in the morning and wear off with exertion. The other complains are < exertion. The mind symptoms are < exertion of the mind.
There are symptoms in connection with hay fever. The rawness in the throat and larynx; dreadful aching in the throat extending to the larynx, which swallowing does not relieve. The Lach. state is expressed more by a lump in the throat; grasping of the throat with a sense of choking.
The Naja patient is subject to severe attacks of bronchitis. There is rawness between the larynx and trachea, < after coughing.
This is a great remedy in asthma, especially cardiac asthma. The breathing is so bad that he cannot lie down.
Useful in chronic nervous palpitation; palpitation after exertion of any kind. Chronic nervous palpitation with inability to speak on account of choking.
There is a continued, dull, aching pain through the back between the shoulders, associated with cardiac affections.
Sometimes there is little beside this sensation of heat, of aching, to indicate the remedy; he is so tired in that spot that be wants to lie down or lean backwards to test his back.
The palpitation is < lying on the left side, < walking.
This is the most useful of all the remedies we have in a cardiac state with very, few symptoms. It is true that this region is particularly singled out by Naja to produce its symptoms.

This is true of all the Sodiums, but especially so of Natrum carb.; aggravation from the slam of a door, a pistol shot, which causes headache and complaints in general, aggravated from music.
Digestion: The more soda these patients take, the more flatulent do they become; they are stoop- shouldered; digestion is difficult, and finally milk will not digest at all, bringing on a diarrhoea with undigested, lienteric stools; also, starch causes flatulence and looseness of the bowels, Many symptoms from drinking cold water when overheated.
Urine offensive like that of a horse, from a vegetable or milk diet. This is not so marked as in Nitric ac., but resembles it.
Skin: Natrum carb. throws out eruptions upon the knuckles and fingertips; also the toes; vesicular eruptions open up and form ulcers on the joints of finger-tips.

The eruption passes away with a crust, but will often ulcerate, it does not heal and an ulcer forms. Circulation feeble; wounds suppurate. Feet and skin burn. Crusty eruptions on the skin that have not been vesicular; but most Natr. carb. and Natr. mur. eruptions are of the vesicular form. Tingling, biting, itching, changing place, now here and now there; cold skin; sweaty body.
Mind: Nervous exhaustion, physical exhaustion, weakness of mind and body.
Book-keepers lose the ability to add up figures. In reading a page, the one previous to, it soon goes out of the mind. The memory will not hold out from the beginning to the end of a sentence. Forgets what he reads.
Confusion of mind follows and then he is unable, to perform any mental labor. Men become so fatigued from the details of business that a confusion of the mind comes over them, they get brain fag.
Oversensitive to heat, especially after sunstroke, even some years after; has to be well shaded when walking in the sun, must seek a cool or dark place the patient has not had the proper acute remedy during the attack the remedy is aggravated by both cold and heat, but this is a special aggravation from the heat of the sun; head troubles are not worse from cold in Natr. carb.
Old cases of brain fag with weakness and trepidation. The body troubles are aggravated from cold and in the winter; as cold as if he had no blood in the body, extremities cold, and he cannot get them warm; cold as ice to, the knees and elbows.
The body and extremities are worse in winter, the head in summer.

Otalgia, with sharp, darting, piercing pains when the mental state, the chilliness and other generals are present. The discharges are commonly offensive.
Coryzas trouble much; always has a cold in the head the watery discharge is of short duration and is soon followed by a thick copious flow of yellow mucus.
Ulceration, thick crusts; sleeps at night with the month open; dry, yellow crusts are blown out with pain and bleeding. The catarrh increases with each fresh cold, until it becomes foetid; the bones of the nose are
affected; almost a constant headache over the eyes, in the forehead, at the root of the nose; congestive headaches, worse from change of weather, cold room, damp weather; increased by every storm.
Most foetid ozoena, mucous membranes ulcerated and destroyed.

So are the Natrum babies in general.
Accumulation of mucus in the throat and posterior nares, generally yellow in color, while with Natr. mur. it is white; the latter spits up copious, thick, white mouthfuls.
Natr. carb. is ameliorated by eating; when chilly, he eats and is able to keep warm; the pains are ameliorated after eating; he has an all gone feeling and pain in the stomach which drives him to eat; he gets hungry at 5 A.M. and 1 P.M. 5 A.M. is the favorite time for the Natr. carb. aggravation; he becomes so hungry at this time that he is forced out of bed to eat something, which also ameliorates the pain.
Headache, chilliness, and palpitation better from eating (Ignat., Sepia, Sulph.).
Nervous hunger in pregnant women, who cannot sleep unless they get up at night and eat crackers, calls for Psorinum.

There may be a spasm of the sphincter, producing the same effect, or a clot of blood or mucus shoots from the vagina with noisy flatus. Nervous, fidgety, excitable, lean, dyspeptic women, not hysterical. Menses too soon or too late; neuralgias, oversensitive to drafts and dampness, sensitive spine, legs numb; leucorrhea yellowish-green, copious.

Natrum Muriaticum
Generals and aspect: Salt is so common an article of diet that it has been assumed that it could be of no use in medicine.
This is only the opinion of men who, operate entirely on the tissues. There are no constitutional effects from crude salt.
One may find an individual growing thin with all the symptoms of salt; he is taking salt in great quantities, but digesting none of it. Salt will be found in the stool, for it does not enter into the life. There is a Natr. mur. inanition, a starving for salt. The same is true of lime. Children can get plenty of lime from their food and that is better when the salt or the lime is given in such shape that it cannot be resisted by the internal man - aimed not at the house he lives in, but at the individual himself-then the bone, salt inanition, the Natr. mur. inanition, will soon pass away.
We do not with our small dose supply the salt that the system needs, but we cure the internal disease, we turn into order the internal physical man, and then the tissues get salt enough from the food. Drugs must all be administered in suitable form. We may need to go higher and higher until the secret spring is touched.
Natr. mur. is a deep acting, long acting remedy. It takes a wonderful hold of the economy, making changes that are lasting when given in potentized doses.
A great deal is presented that can be seen by looking at the patient, so that we say: this looks like a Natr. mur. patient. Experienced physicians learn to classify patients by appearance. The skin is shiny, pale, waxy, looks as if greased. There is a wonderful prostration of a peculiar kind. Emaciation, weakness, nervous prostration, nervous irritability.
Mind: There is a long chain of mental symptoms; hysterical condition of the mind and body; weeping alternating with laughing; irresistible laughing at unsuitable times; prolonged, spasmodic laughter.
This will be followed by tearfulness, great sadness, joylessness. No matter how cheering the circumstances are she cannot bring herself into the state of being joyful. She is benumbed to impressions, easily takes on grief, grieves over nothing.
Unpleasant occurrences are recalled that she may grieve over them. Consolation aggravated the state of the mind - the melancholy, the tearfulness, sometimes brings on anger. She appears to bid for sympathy and is mad when it is given.
Headache comes on with this melancholy. She walks the floor in rage. She is extremely forgetful; cannot cast up accounts; is unable to meditate; forges what she was going to say; loses the thread of what she is hearing or reading. There is a great prostration of the mind.
Unrequited affection brings on complaints. She is unable to control her affections and falls in love with a married man. She knows that it is foolish, but lies awake with love for him. She falls in love with a coachman. She knows that she is unwise, but cannot help it. In cases of this kind Natr. mur. will turn her mind into order, and she will look back and wonder why she was so silly. This remedy belongs to hysterical girls.
In a mental state where Ign. temporarily benefits the symptoms, but does not cure, its chronic Natr. mur. should be given. It is as well to give Natr. mur. at once if there is an underlying constitutional state too deep for Ign.
Modalities: Aversion to bread, to fats and rich things.
The Natr. mur. patient is greatly disturbed by excitement, is extremely emotional. The whole nervous economy is in a state of fret and irritation, < from noise, the slamming of a door, the ringing of a bell, the firing of a pistol, < music.
The pains are stitching, electric-like shocks, convulsive jerkings of the limbs on falling asleep, twitchings, shooting pains. She is oversensitive to all sorts of influences, is excitable, emotional, intense.
Complaints come on in the warm room, worse in the house, she wants the open air. The mental complaints are > in the open air. She takes cold easily from sweating, but is generally > in the open air, though worse on getting heated; < by sufficient exertion to heat up, but > by moderate exertion in the cold air.
Both Natr. carb. and Natr. mur. have the general nervous tension of Natrum, but one is a chilly patient, the other warm, blooded.
Face: The face is sickly looking, the skin greasy, shiny, sallow, yellow, often chlorotic, covered with vesicular eruptions around the edges of the hair, the ears and back of the neck.
There are scaly and squamous eruptions, with great itching, oozing a watery fluid, or sometimes dry. An exfoliation takes place, a shining surface is left. In the meatus, scales form, and peel off, leaving an oozing surface.
Watery vesicles form about the lips and wings of the nose, about the genitals and anus. Vesicular eruptions, white, oozing a watery fluid, come and go. Great itching of the skin is present,
The skin looks waxy, dropsical. There is great emaciation, the skin looking dry, withered, shrunken. An infant looks like a little old man. There is a down on the face that passes away when improvement sets in. Emaciation takes place from above downward.
The collar-bones become prominent and the neck looks scrawny, but the hips and lower limbs remain plump and round. Lyc. also has emaciation from above downward. The directions of remedies will often enable us to distinguish one from another.
Discharges: The characteristic discharge from the mucous membranes is watery or thick whitish, like the white of an egg.
There is a marked coryza with a watery discharge, but the constitutional state has thick, white discharges. He hawks out a thick, white discharge in the morning. There are gluey oozings from die eyes. From the ears flows a thick, white, gluey discharge. The leucorrhoea is white and thick.
With the gonorrhoea the discharge has existed a long time and become gleety. There is smarting m the urethra only after urination.
Head: The headaches are awful; dreadful pains; bursting, compressing, as if in a vise; the head feels as if the skull would be crushed in. The pains are attended with hammering and throbbing. Pain like little hammers in the head on beginning to move.
Hammering pains in the head on waking in the morning.
The pain comes on in the latter part of sleep. There is great nervousness during the first part of the night; she falls asleep late and awakes with hammering in the head. There are also headaches beginning at 10 tou A.M., lasting until 3 P.M. or evening.
The headaches are periodical, every day, or third day, or fourth day. Headaches of those living in malarial districts, > from sleep; the patient must go to bed and be perfectly quiet, > from sweating, headaches associated with intermittent fever.
During the chill it seemed as though the head would burst; he is delirious and drinks large quantities of cold water. There is no relief to the head until after the sweat. Sometimes all the symptoms are relieved by the sweat except the headache.
In another form of headache; the greater the pain the more the sweat; sweating does not relieve; the forehead is cold, covered with a cold sweat. When the head is covered warmly he is > moving about in the open air.
Headache due to disturbance of vision where there is inability to focus rapidly enough. Headache < from noise.
Headache involving the whole back of the head and even going down the spine in troubles following the brain diseases, hydrocephalus.
Spine: In spinal troubles, when there is great sensitiveness to pressure an irritable spine.
The vertebrae are sensitive and there is a great deal of aching along the spine. Coughing aggravates the pain in the spine, also walking makes it worse, but it is > from lying on something hard, or pressing the back up against something hard; they may sit with a pillow or the hand pressed against the back. In menstrual
troubles, you find the woman lying with some hard object under the spine.
A general nervous trembling pervades the body. There is jerking of the muscles, trembling of the limbs, inability to keep the limbs still, as in Zincum.
Stomach and liver: The stomach and liver are closely related.
The stomach is distended with flatus. After eating there is a lump in the stomach. It seems to take a long time for food to digest. < from eating. Whitish, slimy mucus is vomited attended with relief.
There is great thirst for cold water, sometimes there is relief from drinking, sometimes the thirst is unquenchable. We find fullness in the region of the liver with stitching, tearing pains.
The bowels are distended with gas. There is slowing down of the action of the bowels, the stool being very difficult, in hard, agglomerated lumps.
Bladder: There is slowing down of the action of the bladder. Must wait before the urine will start, and then it comes slowly-dribbles; there is not much force in the flow.
After urination there is a sensation as if more urine remained in the bladder. If anyone is present he cannot pass urine, cannot pass it in a public place.
There is also continued urging, he must pass the urine often.
This remedy and Natr. sulph. were used by the homoeopaths to clear up chronic diarrhoea, the old army diarrhoea.
Natr. mur. is useful in the complaints of women, in troublesome menstruation. There is a great variety of menstrual complaints: menses too scanty or too free, too late or too soon. We cannot individualize from the menstrual symptoms, we must do it from the constitutional state.
Examine every possible function to be sure you have all the symptoms. Examine every organ, not by examining it physically, for results of diseases do not lead to the remedy, but examine the symptoms.
Observe the rapidity with which remedies affect the human system there are some that are long acting, deep acting. Natr. mur. is one of these. It operates very slowly, bringing about its results after a long time, as it corresponds to complaints that are slow, that are long in action.
This does not mean that it will not act rapidly; all remedies act rapidly, but not all act slowly; the longest acting may act in acute diseases, but the short acting cannot act long in chronic diseases. Get the pace, the periodicity of remedies.
Some remedies have a continued fever, some a remittent, others an intermittent fever. In Acon., Bell. and Bry. we have three different paces, three different motions, three different forms of velocity; so in Sulph., Graph., Natr. mur., Carbo veg. a different form, a different development.
Some would not hesitate in a continued fever to give Bell., but its complaints come on in great haste, with great violence and have nothing in their nature like a continued fever. This is not like typhoid. Bell. and Acon. have no manifestations of typhoid, even if the symptoms are present.
Be sure that the remedy has not only the group of symptoms, but also the nature of the case. The typhoid case has a likeness in Bry. or Rhus, but not in Bell. We owe no obedience to man, not even to our parents, after we are old enough to think for ourselves. We owe obedience to truth.
Natr. mur. is a long acting remedy; its symptoms continue for years; it conforms to slow-coming, long- lasting, deep-seated symptoms. It requires a long time for a man to be brought under the influence of it, even when moderately sensitive.
The chill comes in the morning at 10-30; every day, every other day, every third or fourth day. The chill begins in the extremities which become blue; there is throbbing pain in the head, the face is flushed; delirium, talking of everything, constant maniacal actions.
They grow worse until a congestive attack comes. During the entire attack there is thirst for cold water. During the coldness he is not > by heat, not > by piling on the clothing, but wants cold drinks.
We would naturally suppose that a person freezing to death would want warm things, but the Natr. mur. patient cannot bear them.
The teeth chatter, he tosses from side to side, the bones ache as if they would break, and there is vomiting as in congestive conditions. In the fever he is so hot that the fingers are almost scorched with the intense heat, and he goes into a congestive sleep or stupor. The sweat relieves him; the aching all over is > by the sweat, and in time the headache passes away.
There is intense chill, fever and sweat. Sometimes the attacks are in robust, strong people, but usually in the anaemic, in emaciated people full of malaria; lingering, chronic cases.
Complaints do not always have this long prodrome. Its most striking use is in cases that have been living a long time in malarial swamps; saturated with the malarial atmosphere; they are anaemic, often dropsical; in old cases that have been mixed with arsenic and quinine, the crude drugs used by the Old School to break the fever as long as the patient is under their sway, but the patient is sick internally even more than before, and when the condition comes back, it is generally in its original form; the crude drug is usually unable to change the type of an intermittent fever.
Remedies only partly related to the case will change the character of the sickness so that no one can cure the case. The homoeopathic remedy will cure intermittent fever every time if you get the right remedy. If there is a failure the case is mixed up so that no one may be able to cure it. First of all a master must realize the case and turn it into order so that it can then be cured. There are few men who never spoil a case of ague, because many cases come from partly developed, marked cases, the symptoms not being all out, especially in cases that have taken homoeopathic remedies. The homeopathic failures are the worst failures on earth.
Natr. mur. is irregular enough in its nature to develop the chills into regularity. When it has come into better order, wait: either the whole case will subside, or another remedy will be clear. There are other
remedies that can turn cases into order. Often cases spoiled by homoeopaths can be turned into order by Sep. Marked cases with congestion of the head, aching in the back and nausea are turned into order by Ipecac.
The cure is permanent after homoeopathic prescribing; the chills do not return.
Natr. mur. not only removes the tendency to intermittents, but restores the patient to health, and takes away the tendency to colds, the susceptibility to colds, and to periodicity. It is the susceptibility that is removed. We know that every attack predisposes to another attack.
Each attack of ague is more destructive than the previous one. The drugs used increase the susceptibility; the homeopathic remedy removes$ the susceptibility. Homeopathic treatment tends to simplify the human
economy and to make diseases more easily managed.
Unless this susceptibility be eradicated, man goes down lower and lower into emaciation, emaciation from above downwards.
Children born in a malarial region are likely to go into, marasmus. They have a voracious appetite, a wonderful hunger, eating much, but all the time emaciating.
Pregnancy: Conditions of pregnancy. The mammary glands waste, there is wasting of the upper parts of the body. The uterus is intensely sore. The leucorrhoea, which is at first white, turns green. Women take cold in every draft of air.
There is pain during sexual congress with dryness of the vagina, a feeling as though sticks pressed into the walls of the vagina; pricking pains.
There is dryness of all mucous membranes; everywhere the membranes are dry. The throat is dry, red,
patulous; a sensation of a fishbone jagging into it when swallowing; there is inability to swallow without washing down the food with liquids; there is sticking all the way down the oesophagus.
Throat: Most prescribers give Hep. for every sticking or fishbone sensation in the throat; this is the old keynote, the old routine.
Nitr. ac., Argent. nit., Alum. and Natr. mur. all have it, but all differently. Hepar sulfur: The tonsils are swollen, full, purple-quinsy.
The patient is sensitive to the slightest draught, there is pain in the throat even on putting the hand out of bed; he sweats in the night with no relief; he is sensitive to every impression; feels everything ten times amplified.
Nitricum Acidum: There are yellow patches in the throat; ragged, jagged ulcers in the throat, or it is inflamed and purple.
The urine smells like horses’ urine.
Argentum nitricum: There is much hoarseness, the vocal cords being disturbed.
The throat is swollen, patulous; the patient wants cold things, cold water, cold air. Adapted to those cases that have had ulceration of the os uteri with cauterization.
Natrum Muriaticum: There is extreme dryness of the mucous membranes, as if they would break; chronic dryness without ulceration.
There is much catarrhal discharge like the white of an egg, with dryness of the mucous membranes when not covered by this mucus. The patient is extremely sensitive, sensitive to a change of weather.
Every remedy has its own pace, its order or succession. We must bear in mind the order of succession.
Natr. mur. is useful in old dropsies, especially dropsy of cellular tissues. Sometimes there is dropsy of sacs, dropsy of the brain following acute diseases. In acute spinal meningitis with extreme nervous tension, where there is chronic drawing back of the head, chronic jerking of the head forward.
Acute diseases that result in hydrocephalus, or in irritation of the spine. Sometimes useful in abdominal dropsy, but more often in oedema of the lower extremities. Acute dropsies after scarlet fever; the patient is oversensitive, starts in his sleep, rises up in the night with confusion; there are albumen and casts in the urine,
In dropsy after the malaria, Natr. mur., when it acts curatively, generally brings back the original chill. The only cure known to man is from above down, from within out, and in the reverse order of coming. When it is otherwise, there is only improvement, not cure. When the symptoms return there is hope; that is the road to cure and there is no other.
The skin symptoms are sometimes very striking. In old lingering cases where the skin looks transparent as if the patient would become dropsical, a waxy, greasy, shiny skin; other remedies with greasy, shiny skin are Plumb., Thuja, Selen.
These remedies go deep into the life. Any remedy that can produce such wonderful changes is long-acting.
Useful after labor when the mother does not progress well; she is feeble and excitable; the lochia is prolonged, copious and white; the hair falls out from the head and genitals; the milk passes away, or the child does not thrive on it.
Useful in after pains where there is subinvolution of the uterus, the uterus is in a state of prolonged congestion.
She is < noise, music, the slamming of a door. She craves salt and has an aversion to bread, wine and fat things. Sour wines disorder the stomach. Natr. mur. will clear up the case, restore the milk, turn the case into order.
Natr. mur. is needed by those chlorotic girls who have a greasy skin, a greenish, yellowish complexion; who menstruate only once in two or three months.
The menses are copious, or scanty and watery. Where the symptoms agree, this remedy can eradicate this chlorosis and turn the countenance into a picture of health, but not in a short time.
It takes years to establish health in a typical chlorosis; the cut finger bleeds only water; the menstrual flow is only a leucorrhoea; there is pernicious anemia. Natr. mur., goes deep enough into the life to restore the pink complexion.

Nux Moschata
This is not a very great remedy; it has not a very wide range of usefulness, but it is often overlooked when needed.
We get into the habit of relying entirely on the polychrests.
The old women used to give nutmeg to hysterics, and wonderful to tell its provings justify its use. It must have had some palliative relation to the hysteria. The root is much stronger than the nut, in the same proportions, and contains the real medicinal qualities.
The patient appears to be dazed; there is a complete loss of memory; she is automatic in her actions. This is a wonderful state of the mind. She goes about the house performing her duties, but if interrupted, forgets what she has been doing, forgets that she was all day in conversation with her son; she has no recollection of past events.
Mind: This is a singular state of the mind sometimes found in hysterical women.
Sometimes it is impossible to find out what state of the mind is present she is so forgetful. She lies with the eyes closed and yet knows everything that is going on, but remembers nothing. She speaks with intelligence about the things of the moment, but knows nothing of the past. She prophesies, predicts with a sort of clairvoyance.
The mental state is the keynote. Sometimes she is < in the morning, sometimes in the evening, or on waking. She performs all her duties and yet seems to be in a dream, she seems not to know her friends.
Sleep: The Nux mos. patient is always ready to go to sleep; it is with great difficulty that she can keep awake. She falls asleep on all occasions, in season and out of season. The eyes look heavy; she cannot keep awake; falls into a profound slumber, sometimes into coma.
Useful in the coma of typhoid and intermittent fever. When aroused she remembers nothing; looks dazed; looks about and wants to know who the people are around and what they are doing. It is a state in which patients answer questions slowly after a long interval, and then look confused again.
They give an answer that has no relation to the question asked, or, answer correctly. We find such a state in typhoid, in hysteria, after shock, after fear, blighted affections, or the loss of a friend. It is more suitable after shock ending in this kind of trouble than in typhoid.
It is also useful in typhoid, but where there is great weakness, sliding down in bed, and nervous trembling, Phos. ac. is a better remedy. Nux mos. does not relate so completely to the general image of a typhoid as does Phos. ac.
The sleepiness and the dazed state are two things combined, and when combined are difficult to cover by a remedy. This state is somewhat like Opium.
Faintness and even fainting when standing long, such as occurs in a nervous woman standing to have a dress fitted.
There is a dry mouth, the tongue cleaves to the roof of the mouth in all complaints. There is great sleepiness and automatic conduct, especially in nervous women. It has cured petit mal.
The hemorrhages stand out in bold relief; hemorrhages from the nose, uterus and bowels. There is vomiting of blood.
The patient is sensitive to wind, to a draft, to damp air. She has a headache < walking against the wind; hoarseness from walking against the wind; she is so sensitive to cold weather that she comes home dazed and sleepy from walking against the wind; her mouth is dry but there is no thirst, she doesn't desire water (sometimes thirst is present).
The patient may hold water in the mouth without desire to swallow it. Nux mos. holds ice water and succulent fruits in the mouth to relieve the sensation of dryness. Often there is a sensation of dryness when the mouth is moist.
In the extremities there is numbness, tingling, prickling, paralytic weakness; there is threatened paralysis; momentary hysterical paralysis; coming for a short time and then going away.
Aphonia with a dry mouth, in hysterical patients; when walking out of doors. This aphonia passes away on going into the house.
The whole back is sensitive to pressure, the vertebrae are sensitive.
This remedy has prolonged and inveterate constipation; prolonged urging to stool followed by a soft stool. (Alum., Psor., China.) The stool is difficult but soft. He wonders why he has to urge for a soft stool.
Women: In woman there are many troubles; menorrhagia lasting ten or fifteen days; the blood is clotted; the menses are too often, last too long, are irregular. The abdomen is full of colic; cramping pains extending to be broad ligaments and down the limbs; most distressing dysmenorrhoea from exposure to cold, riding in the wind or living in damp houses.
With this there is a dry mouth and thirstlessness; she wakes at night with a dry mouth; it seems as if the tongue cleaved to the roof of the mouth.
This remedy is especially suitable for lean women, those who have lost flesh. The breasts are flat. I remember a case of a woman thirty five years old whose breasts which were once well rounded became perfectly flat. Nux mos. restored the breasts.
This is a little remedy, but when wanted nothing will take its place.
Nux Vomica
Antidote: Everywhere in this remedy we observe the striking oversensitiveness of the patient; it is brought out in all the symptoms.
Irritable; oversensitive to noise, to light, to the least current of air, to his surroundings; extremely touchy in regard to his food; many kinds of food disturb, strong foods disturb; he is aggravated by meat; craves stimulants, pungent, bitter, succulent things, something to brace him up.
Oversensitive to medicines. One reason why there are so many Nux patients is because people have been overdrugged by the old school. When a patient comes from the old school and had prescribing, having had stimulants and tonics to brace him up, wine and stimulants of all sorts, it is sometimes impossible to get reliable symptoms, to get the patient settled down, until we give Nux as an antidote.
It is useful in those overdrugged by tea, coffee, wine. Old coffee drinkers become sensitive, oversensitive to noise, their symptoms are flitting; they do not give their symptoms well. Such patients will do well for a few days on Nux; some of their symptoms will drop out and they will settle down.
Mind: The mental state is varied, but they all show oversensitiveness irritable, touchy, sensitive conditions.
They are never contented, never satisfied; disturbed by their surroundings, and the become irritable, so that they want to tear things, to scold. Impulses are strongly marked at times. The woman has impulses to destroy her husband or to throw her child into the fire; the impulse is intermingled with violent temper, cannot be contradicted or opposed; if a chair is in the way he kicks it over; if, while undressing, a part of his clothing should catch on a button he would pull it off because he is so mad at it. (Like Nit. ac.).
An uncontrollable state of irritability; it is a weakness and is accompanied by physical weakness; a lack of balance. For example, a business man has been at his desk until he is tired out, he receives many letters, he has a great many irons in the fire; he is troubled with a thousand little things; his mind is constantly hurried from one thing to another until be is tortured. It is not so much the heavy affairs but the little things. He is compelled to stimulate his memory to attend to all the details; he goes home and thinks about it; be lies awake, at night; his mind is confused with the whirl of business and the affairs of the day crowd upon him; finally brain fag comes on.
When the details come to him be gets angry and wants to get away, tears things up, scolds, goes home and takes it out of his family and children. Sleeps by fits and starts; wakens at 3 A.M., and his business affairs crowd on him so that he cannot sleep again until late in the morning when he falls into a fatiguing sleep and wakens up tired and exhausted. He wants to sleep late in the morning.
Melancholy, sadness, but all the time he feels as if he could fly to pieces, jerks things about, tears things up; wants to force things his own way. Driven by impulses to commit acts that verge upon insanity - the destruction of others. Natr. sul. has a strong impulse to destroy himself. Arg. nitr., also, particularly by jumping from a height, but he avoids placing himself in such a position.
He is oversensitive to the open air, to a draft of air; always chilly, always taking cold and it settles in the nose and extends to the chest.
Skin oversensitive to touch, to draft. Full of pains and aches. He sweats easily on the slightest provocation. Brain fag, fatigue, neuralgias; on the verge of insanity and this goes on to convulsions. Convulsions of single muscles and those of the whole body; muscular twitchings; weakness, trembling, and paralysis. This paralytic weakness and disordered state of the activity of the muscles and nerves are prominent.
Another state running through Nux is that actions are turned in opposite directions. When the stomach is sick, it will empty its contents with no great effort ordinarily, but in Nux there is retching and straining as if the action were going the wrong way, as if it would force the abdomen open; a reversed action; retches, gags, and strains and after a prolonged effort he finally empties the stomach.
The same condition is found in the bladder. He must strain to urinate. There is tenesmus, urging. The bladder is full and the urine dribbles away, yet when he strains it ceases to dribble. In regard to the bowels, though the patient strains much, he passes but a scanty stool.
In the diarrhea at times when he sits on the commode in a perfectly passive way, there will be a little squirt of stool, and then comes on tenesmus so that he cannot stop straining, and when he does strain there comes on the sensation of forcing back; the stool seems to go back; a kind of anti-peristalsis.
In constipation the more he strains the harder it is to pass a stool. In diarrhea and dysentery there is straining without relief, but as soon as he passes a little stool there is relief. In dysentery, Merc. has the constant urging; Merc. cor. tenesmus with great desire to urinate.
Pains: The reversed action of the various functions shows the spasmodic nature of this remedy. Pains shoot from the rectum up; burning.
Neuralgias about the eyes, face, and head; neuralgic headaches the pains stick, and tear; they cause weeping, fainting; they burn and sting. Pains in the head and face and in the extremities, that sting and tear, but especially draw. Sensation of tension in the muscles. A drawing in the back like a pulling or tension in the muscles.
The pain feels as if drawing, a spasm of the muscles; a drawing pain in the back; drawing pain in the back of the neck, forcing the patient to let the head go back; drawing pain down the spine; lumbago. Backache worse as soon as she lies down (pregnancy) as if it would break (Bry., Phos - as if broken, Kali c.) must get up and walk.
Neurities with great soreness of skin. Pains in the regions of the kidneys and liver. Pains draw so that he cannot turn over in bed, and the only way he can get over is to lift himself up by his hands and then turn over and lie down. Drawing pains in the sacrum and hips; drawing pains in the sacrum in connection with dysentery. Rending pains in the bowels and every pain causes desire for stool. Such is the characteristic of all the abdominal pains.
Drawing pains in the extremities causing spasms in the calves, feet, and toes. Cramps in the abdomen cause desire for stool; after pains in the form of cramps urge to stool; menstrual colic, with urging to stool; pains in the stomach, after eating, urge to stool. After much straining no stool passes, but after going several times a small stool passes with relief. It is scanty and with reversed peristaltic action.
Oversensitive to stimulants. It ii a routine remedy in men trying to sober up; even in delirium tremens. Old debauchees, broken down with stimulants sexual excesses and the worry and fret of business; they work half an hour and then go out and get a drink, and this goes on until finally they must give up, go home and go to bed. He is on the verge of insanity, irritable, fatigued, sweats much, is aggravated. from the air, sensitive to noise and light; broken down. He must have Nux, rest and no stimulants.
In those drinking too much tea, coffee and stimulants, they stay awake day and night until the end must come; there is tension in all the nerves; he feels as if he must fly, as if he could no longer hold together; his muscles and hands tremble; there is jerking of the limbs on going to sleep and in sleep.
Full of anxiety, despair, and hypochondriasis;
"oversensitive to impressions; "all the senses are in this condition; cannot bear reading or conversation; irritable, and wishes to be alone."
Everybody displeases or does something to annoy him. Everybody that attempts to soothe only angers him. He dreads the business affairs of the day. Finally this state comes on: "he quarrels, reproaches, scolds, insults from jealousy, mingled with unchaste expressions; soon afterwards howls and weeps aloud.”
Patient is broken down sexually because he is unusually endowed with sexual desires and he indulges until broken down; sexually exhausted, impotent. Mental erethism but relaxation on intromission. Driven to suicide.
Nux is an old dyspeptic, lean, hungry, withered; bent forward; premature age; always selecting his food and digesting almost none; aversion to meat, it makes him sick; craves pungent, bitter things, tonics. Weak stomach; after meals pain in the stomach, nausea, retching; stomach sinks in; withers and loses flesh.
Nose: Tendency to take cold; gets coryza.
Colds settle in the nose, throat, chest and ears. Takes cold from the least provocation; perspires easily and the least current of air causes headache with coryza. If he is in a heated room and is disturbed in his equilibrium he gets a coryza.
Cepa coryza is also worse in a warm room. Much stuffing up of the nose in the house at night; nose feels completely filled up, particularly out of doors, but fluent in doors; thin, watery discharge during the day. Sensitive to the least draft; sneezing caused by itching in the nose. This itching goes to the throat and trachea.
Cough; burning in the air passages; all the mucous membranes in a state of irritation; nasal tone to voice; loss of voice; sore throat; tickling cough. Dry, teasing cough with great soreness of the chest, like Bry., the head feels as if it would split.
Coryza goes to the chest. Grippe with fever and bone pains; must pile on clothing; the only relief is by keeping unusually hot, yet a warm room aggravates the coryza before the fever comes on; but after the fever comes on he must have heat; aggravated even from the movement of air under the bed clothes; lifting the covers aggravates the pains, cough, etc.
Sharp fever and sweat, or a hot sweat like Opium (but Opium in a hot sweat wants the covers off, while Nux cannot raise the covers). Chills and fever; heat and sweat intermingled. In chills the fingers and hands are cold, and purple; cold from head to foot; the chill begins in the extremities or back, and extends over the whole body and, the patient must be covered up. Shortly there is a reaction and heat and sweat come on, but he must be covered through all the stages. Thirst is not a marked feature; sometimes it is found in the heat.
Tendency to jaundice in all the febrile states. Sclerotics become yellow. Skin becomes very yellow. Old intermittents with yellow skin. Runs close to Bry. in abdominal complaints with jaundice.
Nux suffers from a disordered stomach. A stasis of the portal system is present, portal congestion; stasis in hoemorrhoidal veins with hemorrhoids; constipation; dysentery; paralysis of the rectum.
Stomach symptoms like Puls.; worse in the morning; foul mouth in the morning also like Puls. Bursting sensation in the head as if a stone crushed the vertex after disordered stomach.
Full of paralytic conditions. The bowels are in a state of excitement but this passes away and the time comes when the faeces remain in the rectum with no warning. This extends to the bladder, so that it becomes full of urine which cannot be voided; dribbling of urine in old men with large prostrate, or in gonorrhea.
Paralysis of the extremities; of the face; one arm; one hand; single muscles; facial paralysis not uncommonly cured by Nux. The sticking pains in paralysis are important.
At times false plethora, with flushed face; excitement of face blushing; great weakness and exhaustion, with irritability and the mental condition. When under no exertion with nothing to think of, patient appears to be well, but the thought of doing something exhausts him in a moment.
Headache from sweating; in wine drinkers; in those staying out at night; from night watching. The greatest relief in headaches as from perfect quiet. Headaches as if a stone pressed upon the vertex.
Most symptoms better from heat, but the head is worse from heat. Acne from eating cheese. It has most violent convulsions with opisthotonos; convulsions of all the muscles of the body, with purple face and loss of breath from the movements; conscious or semi-conscious during the whole spasm, aware of the sufferings and contortions which are horrible; worse from the slightest draft of air; tickling of the feet; the merest touch of the throat causes gagging.
It is given as a routine remedy for loss of appetite. It will increase the appetite but do dangerous work to the patient.
"Aversion to meat, usual food and drink, and customary tobacco and coffee, to water, ale, food just eaten."
Abdomen: Pains particularly of the abdomen; pains cutting, causing the patient to bend double, with nausea from overeating; bearing down; spasmodic pains in the abdomen, often extend into the limbs, but more often towards the rectum; colicky pains which urge to stool and urination; renal colic, especially when each pain shoots to the rectum and urges to stool.
Renal colic is caused by a stone in the ureter, which by its irritation causes a spasmodic clutching of the circular fibres of that canal; the proper medicine relaxes these fibres and the pressure from behind forces these calculi out at once.
The same is true of gall stone colic. The remedy that ameliorates, or some of its cognates, will overcome the tendency to form stones. Healthy bile dissolves gall stones in the sac; healthy urine does the same to a stone in the pelvis of the kidney.
Nux runs close to Bry. in abdominal complaints with marked yellowness of the skin. Bry. is worse from motion and not better from heat - Nux is both and is more suited to portal congestion, the neuralgias, etc.; is worse from slightest pressure (Coloc. is better from the slightest pressure, Mag. ph. is better from pressure and heat).
Bry. indicated more in peritonitis, lies with limbs drawn up. Hemorrhoids, portal congestion, cutting pains to rectum causing urging to stool.
Cupr. has cutting pains from front to back as if transfixed.
Abdomen sunken in Nux, while in Calc. and Sepia it is engorged. Inula resembles Nux; has colic with urging to stool and to urinate.
"Milk sours on the stomach."
"Heat in the head when eating."
Bad effects from coffee, alcoholic drinks, debauchery. Sensation of phlegm in the throat; worse from eating. Aloe has diarrhea from leaving off beer. Nux has diarrhea from leaving off alcoholic drinks.
Sensation of a lump in the stomach (Bry.). In chronic cases Sepia is more apt to be indicated and follows Nux well, but quarrels with Bry.; associate this with the pressure in the vertex and you have the typical Nux condition.
Sensation of stone comes an hour after eating, showing that there has been an attempt at digestion, but in Abies nig. it comes at once. Kreos. pains do not begin until three hours after eating and then the food is vomited.
It is closely related to Sulphur and often antidotes the overaction of Sulphur. It seldom goes to the bottom and antidotes the constitutional action of Sulphur, but it will remove its exaggerated action, its superficial action.
Women: Menses too soon; too long; flow copious; more strikingly prolonged; flows and dribbles just enough to stain the linen, starting up now and again with clots.
One menstrual flow is prolonged into another. This will be accompanied with the mental state; excitable; oversensitive to medicines.
"Menses too early and too profuse; occur too soon and last too long; flow dark."
At times attended with violent pains, cramps in the uterus, extending over the body, ameliorated from heat and pressure; aggravated by the slightest current of air or cold; pains and spasms ameliorated by the hot water bottle, clothing, and heat.
Labor pains with soreness like Arnica, urging, etc. Bearing down as if contents would protrude, with teasing to urinate and urging to stool. The flow may be scant and fitful. Itching of the vulva is prominent.
Full of hysterical manifestations. Europeans develop symptoms more often calling for Nux in their hysterical manifestations, while Americans oftener need Ignatia.
Has troublesome asthma. Useful in persons who say they have asthma from every disordered stomach. They may go free for a year after Nux is given, and then they eat something that disagrees, and they sit up all night with asthma. They need Nux. Asthma associated with cough; rattling in the chest; chest fills up with mucus; cough with gagging, retching; appears as if he had taken a fresh cold.
Coryza every time he disorders his stomach. | have a patient who has a coryza every time she eats sausage; there is no cure for her because she places her coffee, wine, and social matters above her health. She can eat steak; some cannot eat any meat. After a disturbed stomach coryza which goes to the chest and then asthma comes on.
Palpitation and excitement of the heart and circulation. Much throbbing, Worse in the morning - mentally and physically. The coryza and some head symptoms are worse from the warmth of the bed like Merc., yet worse uncovering; worse from eating and from- motion; head is worse from heat.
Pressure and sense of weakness in, the left inguinal ring - hence cures hernia in babies (Lyc., right side). Arn. relieves soreness, etc. Conium also - it competes with Nux in sense of goneness in the groin.
Chills are riot better from any amount of covers; Ign. chills are better uncovering. In intermittents, the chill and heat intermingle, the heat is short and dry, and followed by hot, sweat and intense heat worse in the morning, but the chill comes at any time.
Opium
Generals: Among the striking features of Opium is a class of complaints marked by painlessness, inactivity, and torpor.
Many of the provers taking small doses had torpor, inability to realize or feel their surroundings, or to take in the nature of states and judge of things.
Deception in vision, taste, touch; deception of the state he exists in; in his own realization; a perversion of all the senses with much deception.
The general characteristic is painlessness, but now and then an alternate state is produced, in which a small dose of Opium will cause pain, sleeplessness, inquietude, nervous excitability; the very opposite state from that produced in the majority of cases.
The majority are constipated, but in some there is dysentery and tenesmus. The patient is sleepy, yet at times the drug is characterized by sleepless nights, anxiety, increased sensitiveness to noise, so that he says ho can almost hear the flies walking on the wall, and hears the clock striking in the distant steeple.
It is generally supposed that in these opposite conditions one is primary and the other is secondary. This is true, e. g., those exhibiting stupor and painlessness will go into a state of increased insensibility, inquietude, anxiety, and irritability, and also one who has a state of increased sensibility first will have a docile state following.
Head and mind: Some oversensitive provers will get a basilar headache in the first hour after taking a dose, so that they cannot raise the head from the pillow; they are paralyzed from it; the pain holds them down. This does not come on in most provers until the waning of a large dose. This has been debated over as the primary and secondary actions. What is the action in one is the reaction in another, but all are the effects of the drug, and all the actions that follow are the symptoms of the remedy.
The sluggishness and painlessness are most striking. The inaction is shown in the lack of reaction to the properly selected homeopathic remedy. It here competes with Sulphur. On studying the case you may find many Opium symptoms, and when given thus indicated, it rouses the system out of the state of sluggishness and causes reaction.
Ulcers which are perfectly painless, which do not granulate, and do not eat or spread, with numbness or lack of sensibility in the ulcer that ought to be sensitive; Opium will often heal insensibility in parts that are in a high grade of inflammation.
Paralytic conditions or paresis, partial paralysis; inactivity, sluggishness. Such a condition is found in the bowels so that they do not move, and rectum fills with round, hard, black balls, which can be dug out with the finger or spoon. There is no activity, no ability to strain at stool.
The bladder is in a similar state. There is no ability to use the abdominal muscles; he cannot strain to urinate retention of accelerator muscles are in a state of paresis.
When drinking the oesophagus seems to have no action and the fluid does not go down but passes out through the nose; a paresis fluids go down the wrong way or out through the nose.
Weakness of limbs and muscles; weakness and paralysis.
Often there is a state of peace. Wants to be let alone. She tells you she is not sick; and yet she has a temperature of 105-106°, is covered with a scorching hot sweat, has a rapid pulse; is delirious. You ask her how she is and she says she is perfectly well and happy; no pains or aches; wants nothing and has no symptoms. But the nurse tells you that the patient has passed no stool or urine.
Face: The face looks besotted, bloated, purple; the eyes are glassy and the pupils contracted. The brain is in a state of confusion, yet she can answer questions. Or the mental symptoms may be more marked and the physical condition less prominent; there is confusion of mind, delirium, loquacity, but this is rare, more commonly only talks when aroused; a condition of stupor in which the patient will say nothing and do nothing. Delirium with a happy turn of mind.
The stomach is in a state of undue warmth, sinking, all-gone, hungry, and this is not relieved by eating. He fills the stomach full and yet the faint feeling remains. The food sours in the stomach and is vomited. He can take no more food. He becomes covered with a cold sweat; great exhaustion; nausea, retching and the vomiting continues. This nausea is a troublesome symptom following the administration of Opium or Morphine. It is a prolonged vomiting and nausea. He can take nothing into the stomach and nothing will stop the vomiting for him.
The homoeopath knows the use of Chamomilla and one dose will give wonderful relief at once and stop the deathly sinking and nausea.
There is never any use for the crude Opium in the sick room. In surgery at times it is admitted that something seems necessary, and we will not quarrel with the surgeon. But in disease, in sick people, it is not necessary. It performs no use and in the end it is an injury; it prevents finding the homoeopathic remedy. It has masked the symptoms and spoiled the case, and you cannot do anything for days.
Opium has been much abused and much has been learned about it, but this abuse has not helped much in its proving, for the individualizing symptoms are not obtained. Big doses cause gross effects, and the symptoms thus obtained are sometimes useful, e. g., in cerebral apoplexy with stertorous breathing, jaw dropped, pupils dilated or contracted, generally the latter, face mottled, purple, or hot, hot sweat, one sided paralysis.
You would wonder on seeing such a case whether be had been paralyzed, had Opium, injured himself in a fall or bad been indulging in the bottle, and you would.. examine the case to distinguish. This is a mechanical trouble, there is pressure of blood on the brain. This alone may not kill but later on inflammatory action is set up around the clot.
Opium causes a flow of blood to the brain, and when given homeopathically it checks this, and in six hours he will become rational, his skin cool, face normal color, pulse normal. We thus see the usefulness of the crude effects of Opium in giving us a picture of apoplexy.
Nervous headaches beginning in the back of the head and spreading over the whole face; worse in the morning. He feels as if his head were held down to the pillow by the intense aching pain in the base of the brain and yet when he gets up he is unable to lie down again.
Women: This is common in women; a false plethora; excitable; going through pregnancy or menstruation; headache. The patient sits up and is unable to lie down. The pain begins in the morning and is so violent that the patient cannot move, cannot wink the eye, turn the head, cannot bear the least jar or the ticking of
the clock; face is mottled, purple, blue; eyes injected. It is difficult to get symptoms from her. Opium will relieve at once.
But most of the complaints are painless.
It takes on the appearance of drinkers, besotted; fever with besotted countenance. Delirium tremens with awful anxiety, vomiting, congestive headache, contracted pupils; violent headache after drinking, exhaustion; not able to get out of bed; delirium. Most of the complaints are attended with stupor; lies in a stupor like apoplexy, cannot be aroused.
Convulsions: The Opium patient is full of convulsions. The patient wants to be uncovered, wants the cool air, the open air. Convulsions if the room, is too warm. Opisthotonos; head drawn back, cerebro-spinal meningitis.
In a case of cerebro-spinal meningitis we find convulsions approaching, opisthotonos, head drawn back, kicks the covers off, wants a cool room; skin red; face red and mottled, pupils contracted. Now if the mother puts that child into a hot bath, to relieve the convulsions, it will become unconscious and cold as death. If you are called to see such a case be sure to give Opium, and in twelve hours you will be astonished to see the state of quietude. It competes here with Apis. Puerperal convulsions.
A mental state appears in these constitutions. Fear and its results. The Opium patient, when not too stupid, rouses up as if startled, rouses up with the appearance of awful fear or anxiety. The old Opium eater is overwhelmed with anxiety and fear. If a dog jump at him suddenly, he will be thrown into convulsions, have diarrhea, fits of some sort, and it will be days and weeks before that fear is gone.
Complaints from fear when the fear remains, or the idea of the fear remains, or the cause of it comes before the eyes. A pregnant woman is frightened and an abortion is impending, and the object of the fright continually looms up before her eyes. Epilepsy dating back, to a fright, and that object comes up before the eyes before the attack comes on, and the fear of the fright remains.
Hysterical attack; physical shock with diarrhea and sometimes constipation; retention of urine or return of the menstrual flow as results, or it may stop the menses for months. In these conditions there is great fear and the object of the fear remains before the eyes.
An Opium prover, when coming out from under the influence of the drug, sees frightful images, black forms, visions of devils, fire, ghosts, someone carrying her off, murder. Imagines that parts swell and that he is going to burst.
There is also a sensation of bodily well being; great happiness great state of confidence in the first hours of the drug. Hence, complaints from sudden joy, anger, shame, sudden fright. Coffea has a similar state of beatitude. It is both a physical and mental beatitude in Opium. Opium and Coffea are related; they antidote each other.
Opium eaters like whisky drinkers are constitutional liars. They have no conscience left. "Great sensibility to sound, light, and faintest odors." "Drowsiness with headache, amounting almost to stupor."
"Marasmus; child wrinkled and looks like a little dried up old man; stupor."
Old cases of lead poisoning. Pulsatilla cures the diarrhea following the abuse of Opium.
Oxalicum Acidum

Petroleum
Generals: It is one of the abused remedies.
It is used externally in rheumatism, bruises and all sorts of troubles, and the amelioration that comes is the result of establishing a disease on the surface, by counter-irritation, and not by homoeopathic action. Crude Petroleum is extensively used in the oil regions on both man and beast as a "cure all."
Mind: It is a counter-irritant and, on the skin, produces irritation, eruptions and disturbances, like Turpentine.
Among the early things that Petroleum does to a prover is that it puts him in a state of confusion of mind and dizziness; he is dazed so that he loses his way in the street. She has strange imaginations that there are people near her who are not present; that the atmosphere is full of strange forms; that her limbs are double; that another person is in the bed with her.
Such things are found in the fevers. A woman after childbirth imagines there is another child in bed with her, and she wonders how she will take care of the two. These ideas are found in many diseases, have been often verified. In typhoids and low forms of sickness; in diarrheas; when just awakening he is in confusion; in his dreams he had the idea of being two or more and the impression remains with him while he is in a semi-conscious state. He cannot reconcile the state, but when aroused to consciousness he is able to reason it away, and when semi-conscious again it returns. This annoys him day and night.
Skin symptoms. The surface symptoms are striking. The tendency is to throw out vesicles, herpetic vesicles which are isolated, and the tendency of the vesicles is to form thick yellow crusts, with considerable moisture. The vesicles break early.
At times the vesicles do not form crusts, but break early and ulcerate underneath, and this changes into a phagedenic ulcer; this condition occurs about the fingers, scrotum, face and scalp. There is a special tendency to produce vesicular eruptions about the back of the neck.
Papular, pustular, vesicular, dry, mealy eruptions, but most commonly moist; eruptions which extend deeply. It builds up eruptions on the site of old eruptions, with an increasing hardness in the base of the old eruption.
When the crust dries down it indurates, and this induration takes place at the margin and builds up little rings about the margin. The induration cracks, bleeds, looks purple. Apply this to salt rheum, and eruptions about the hands. It is suitable when there are cracks about the ends of the fingers and on the backs of the hands.
The skin is rough, ragged, exfoliates, cracks, bleeds; the tissues are hardened; this occurs sometimes about the palms of the hands and nails. This tissue ulcerates, and the ulcers eat and spread. All eruptions itch violently. He can not rest until he scratches the skin off, when the part becomes moist, bloody, raw and inflamed.
There is also itching with no visible eruption. He scratches the skin until moisture oozes forth, and keeps on scratching until the skin bleeds and the part becomes cold.
(This word makes me remark here that coldness in spots is quite a feature of this remedy. Coldness in spots; coldness in the stomach, in the abdomen, in the uterus; coldness in a spot between the scapula; coldness in the heart - sensation as if the heart were cold.).
Various forms of eczema. Eczema of the scalp, especially of the occiput. Herpetic eruptions about the mouth (Nat. m.), about the genitals, lips, face, and the patches become crusty and ooze much.
The mucous membrane, or internal skin, has little patches of ulcers, with induration about the patch, and hence Petr. is useful in syphilitic ulcers. Ulcerous patches in the throat; aphthous patches in the mouth. There is inflammation of the mucous membranes everywhere, producing watery and finally thick yellow discharges.
The nose is filled by tumefaction of the Schneiderian membrane. Old catarrhal complaints of the nose, crusts, thick yellow discharge, foetid odor from the nose.
The nose, posterior nares and pharynx become thickened and there is an accumulation of thick mucus, especially in the morning.
The larynx is involved and there is loss of voice, and the trouble extends to the chest, causing a catarrhal condition with cough. He coughs especially at night, and there is emaciation of the body with pain and soreness of the chest. Dry, hacking cough, alternating with copious expectoration; emaciation about the chest. A striking feature of this drug is that the cough is worse at night, and the diarrhea is worse during the day.
Catarrh of the stomach and bowels. Catarrh of the rectum, much mucus with the stools. Diarrhoea during the day time, ameliorated at night, while the patient is quiet and at rest.
He cannot eat without pain, but he has a gnawing hunger which drives him to eat. (Lach., Graph.) There is an "all-gone,” hungry feeling after stool, which drives him to eat. With the diarrhea there is constant hunger, yet he cannot eat without pain; emaciation, skin eruptions, unhealthy ragged fingers which never look clean; he cannot wash them, as this causes them to chap.
Urinary and genitals: Catarrh of the bladder and urethra; chronic catarrhal discharge chronic gonorrhea. Itching is common to the internal skin, and a striking feature in gonorrhea is the itching in the posterior half of the urethra with the discharge. It almost drives him wild, keeps him awake at night. He rubs and manipulates the perineum to relieve this itching. The gonorrheal discharge is white or yellow. It is useful in that "last drop."
Also in the early stages of gonorrhea when the itching is troublesome.
Sore bruised feeling all over the body, especially in the joint Rheumatic pain in the joints on motion; sore to touch; sensation as if bruised. It is analogous to Arnica in relation to bruises.
Petroleum is suitable in old stubborn occipital headaches. Silicea is the routine remedy for offensive foot sweat and periodic occipital headaches. Petroleum has also offensive foot sweat; offensive sweats all over, and especially so in the axilla, where it is so pungent that it can be observed on the patient entering the room.
The pain often remains in the occiput, but when very severe it extends up over the top of the head to the eyes and forehead (Silicea has that condition). Petroleum is not so closely related to Silicea as it is to
Graphites and Carbo veg., which are carbonaceous substances; and all carbonaceous products affect the back of the head.
"Pain from occiput over head to forehead and eyes, with transitory blindness; he gets stiff; loses consciousness."
"Circumscribed pain in the occiput, aggravated on shaking the head."
This remedy, unlike Carbo veg., has oversensitiveness of the senses, bearing, touch and smell.
Ears: The Petroleum constitution produces a peculiar vertigo which comes on under regular circumstances, when on ship-board, or riding in a carriage, or on the ears.
It suits occipital headache from riding on the ears, or from such motions, with nausea like seasickness. Seasickness is a trouble we cannot always meet, yet most people, when constitutionally treated, can be directed into a better state, so that they will not be troubled under ordinary conditions, such as riding on the cars or in a carriage.
To a great extent the above condition is due to a lack of accommodation, a visual trouble; coming on, for example, from focusing the eyes on the waves as they retreat from the rear end of the ship, or on passing objects, the patient being relieved while in a dark state-room. Occipital headache, with the vertigo above mentioned, and an all gone hungry feeling or pain in the stomach, driving him to eat, will be mitigated by Petroleum.
The most common form of seasickness I have found to be the following:
Awful deathly nausea pallor, cold body, profuse sweat and exhaustion, ameliorated by fanning, by the open air, by closing the eyes, by quiet and darkness, and aggravated by warmth. Tabacum is generally the remedy of such cases.
In Petroleum there is much disturbance of vision, but the catarrhal the eyes is striking. Vesicular formations, ulcerations, inflammation, redness and copious discharge; granular lids, thickening mucous membranes, cracks in the lids, fissures in the corners eyes with great itching.
This itching is present in all congestions of the mucous membrane. Eustachian tubes. The mucous membrane is thickened, and deafness results. It is a catarrhal state, attended by great itching in the tube, which be cannot reach method; itching deep in the ear. He rubs the ear and tries to it, but he cannot reach it. Itching in the pharynx; also in the I canal of the ear. Ear discharges.
Induration and inflammation of the glands of the body. In ear troubles, the parotids enlarge; in troubles about the jaw, the sub-maxillary and sub-lingual glands are involved; they become hard and tend to remain so.
Face pale or yellow; sickly. "Nausea and qualmishness all day”.
Stiffness in the back. Pain in the back on rising from a seat.
Heat and burning. Skin hot in places; with sensation of coldness. Burning and itching of palms and soles; face and scalp. The itching and burning often go together; parts that burn much. Feet burn and have a sensation as if frozen. Chilblains itch, burn and become purple. Parts frozen will, years after, itch, burn, sting and become red and hot. The patient can tell when it will thaw because of the itching in the chilblains.
Petroleum cures the itching and burning in frozen parts, but not as prominently as Agaricus leads all other remedies, especially when the condition affects parts where the tissues are thin over the bones, as over the back of the toes.
Paretic conditions, especially left-sided., Weakness of muscles, weakness of the lower extremities, especially left-sided.
The eruptions on the surface and the state of induration are like Graphites, but the oozing in Petroleum is thin and watery, and in Graphites it is gluey, honey like, sticky, viscid. You have indurations and cracks of the fingers, and rhagades in both remedies, but the horn-like warty growths, lifting up the quick of the nails, you will find only in Graphites.
It is of wonderful use and competes with Rhus in eczema of the genitals of either male or female. Eruption on the scrotum, penis, vulva.
Rhus produces violent inflammation of the skin of the genitals in male and female; erysipelatous inflammation; nodules vesicles and large blebs. Petroleum produces small vesicles which itch, sting and
burn.
Herpetic eruptions which tend to become erysipelatous. Petroleum and Rhus are the most common remedies for eruptions on the scrotum and genitals.
"Herpetic itching, redness and moisture on scrotum; skin cracked, rough and bleeding; extending to perineum, and thighs."
"Obstinate dry eruptions on genitals and perineum." "Sweat and moisture of external genitals of both sexes."
Scurfy nipples; white, bran-like scurf; itching; always peeling off. If the woman is in run-down health, then the nipples inflame and become oversensitive to the touch of clothing.
Very sensitive to change of weather, like Phos. and Rhod.; aggravated before a thunder storm. Often sensitive to air and cold. Lean, emaciated subjects; threatening consumption. Eruptions disappear of themselves or are suppressed. Hands and feet burn; wants the palms and soles out of bed.
Do not be too sure Sulphur because the soles burn, or too sure of Silicea because the feet sweat. Sweating of single parts. Eruptions in patches. Itching in patches. Coldness in parts. Complaints come in single parts.
The most striking offensiveness is about the feet and in the axillae. There are many strange sensations which are peculiar and striking. Study closely the skin symptoms and compare with Graphites and Sulphur.
Phosphoricum Acidum
Mind: "Mental enfeeblement" is the thought that will come into the mind when considering what the Phosphoric acid patient says, does and looks.
The mind seems tired. When questioned he answers slowly or does not speak, but only looks at the questioner. He is too tired to talk or even think. He says:
"Don't talk to me; let me alone." This state is found in both acute and chronic diseases. He is so tired in mind, perfectly exhausted.
In chronic diseases when brought on from long study; prolonged worry in business men; in feeble school girls, when become relaxed from very little effort. In acute diseases he, especially in typhoid fever, is averse to speaking or answering questions. He merely looks. Finally he rouses up and says:
"Don't talk to me, I am so tired."
He cannot think what he wishes to say, cannot frame his answers to questions. Another cause is sexual excesses in young men, or in those guilty of secret vice. Weakness; lack of reaction; state of stupor, with impotency; mental prostration, and as if the spine had given out.
In every case we find the mental symptoms are the first to develop. The remedy runs from the mental to the physical, from the brain to the muscles.
This is so striking that it is contrasted with Muriaticum acid. in the latter remedy the muscular prostration comes first, and the mind seems clear until long after the muscles are prostrated. In Phosphoric acid the muscles seem strong after the mind has given out. The patient seems vigorous physically.
He says he is all right physically, can work, can exercise even violently; but the mind is tired, there is mental apathy, he can not add up a column of figures, can not read the newspaper and carry the trend of thought, can not connect circumstances. He forgets the names of those in his family; a business man forgets the names of his clerks; he is in confusion. Yet he can exercise, can go out and walk; the weakness in the muscles will come later.
Phosphoric acid has also great physical weakness; so tired in the back; so tired in the muscles; so tired all over; a paralytic weakness. Later there is sexual impotence; aversion to coition; loss of sexual desire; no erections; penis becomes relaxed in the midst of an embrace and he cannot finish the act, (Nux v.)
Ailments from business cares; prolonged grief; young women suffering from unrequited affection, or from the loss of a loved one. Some suffer more intensely than others; some seem more philosophical.
"Ailments from care, grief, sorrow, chagrin, homesickness or disappointed love; particularly with drowsiness; night sweats towards morning; emaciation."
The patient pines and emaciates, grows weaker and weaker, withered in the face; night sweats; cold sweat down the back; cold sweats on the arms and hands more than on the feet; cold extremities; feeble circulation, feeble heart; catches cold on the slightest provocation and it settles in the chest; dry, hacking cough; catarrhal conditions of the chest; tuberculosis; pallor with gradually increasing weakness and emaciation.
During this weakness there is vertigo. Vertigo while lying in bed seems like floating while lying in bed. Limbs seem to be lifted up while the head does not seem to move, as if the limbs were floating. Congestive headaches; in school girls from slight exertion of the mind and use of the eyes. Periosteal pains; bones ache as if scraped ameliorated by motion; when lying the pain shifts to side lain on.
Modalities: Most of the complaints are ameliorated from keeping warm, from absolute quiet, from being alone at peace. There is aggravation of the complaints from exertion, mental or physical, from being talked to. Morning headaches. He must lie down with the headaches. Headache aggravated from being talked to. He is sensitive to cold weather. He is sensitive to a warm room.
In the headache the pain often begins in the back of the head and spreads to the top of the load; feels as ifa crushing weight were on the top of the head; worse from motion, talking and light.
"Pressure as from a weight in head from above downward."
These headaches are associated with mental weakness, brain-fag; so tired and exhausted. Vertigo with ringing in the ears and glassy eyes.
Its use in low fevers must be studied. The complaints come on slowly, slow decline, slowly increasing prostration. Such appearances as are found in advanced typhoid. It has the prostration, tympanitic abdomen, dry, brown tongue, sordes on the teeth, gradually approaching unconsciousness; little thirst increasing to intense thirst with craving for much water during perspiration; wants to be let alone; looks at the questioner with glassy eyes as if slowly comprehending the question; pupils contracted or dilated; eyes sunken; hippocratic countenance; continued fever; bleeding from the nose, lungs, bowels; hemorrhage from any mucous membrane; sunken about the eyes; discolored lips, covered with sordes, becoming very black; prostration gradually increasing.
From the beginning the mental state been most marked and finally comes the muscular weakness, which increases until the jaw drops and it seems that the patient must die of exhaustion.
Such states of weakness may come on from hemorrhages (China was the routine remedy among the older homoeopaths).
It checks the hemorrhage and causes a rally, prevents the dropsy. There is a state like anemia; pale lips and tongue; face, hands and feet waxy.
Pains and aches all over the body, ameliorated from motion and ‘worse from cold. The pains seem deep- seated, often along the nerves, but especially along the long bones, as if the bones were scraped; as if a rough instrument were dragged over the bones. The pains are commonly worse at night. Severe bone pains.
The stomach refuses to do its work. The food remains in the stomach and sours. Sour vomiting. Old dyspeptics with brain-fag. Complaints from acid drinks, cold drinks and rich foods. Singing sensation in the abdomen after a normal stool.
In most of the complaints of Phosphoric acid a marked feature is milky urine. Sometimes it is milky when passed; milky flakes in the urine. At times the male urethra seems to clog up and examination will show these little milk-like-flakes. The urine becomes milky on standing, like flour, chalk or phosphate deposits stirred up in it.
Diarrhea: In Phosphoric acid there is often an amelioration of complaints by their ending in a diarrhea. Copious, thin, watery stool. From the quantity it would seem that the patient would be exhausted. Child with copious, watery, stool in summer; so copious that the napkin seems of no use; the stool runs all over the mother's dress and on the floor forming great puddles; the stool is almost odorless, thin and watery, and the little one smiles as if nothing were the matter. The mother wonders where it all comes from, and yet the child seems well.
The Phosphoric acid diarrhea often ameliorates many of the symptoms and the patient feels better. Chronic diarrhea, copious, thin and watery, whitish gray, and the patient feels comfortable, free and, happy. If the diarrhea slacks up the patient is worse and on come symptoms of tuberculosis, weakness, prostration, brain-fag.
Some patients say they ate never comfortable unless they have diarrhea. Podophyllum is the very opposite. Take the same child; the stool is very copious and runs all over the floor, the mother wonders where it all comes from, but the stool is offensive, a horrible stench, and the patient looks as if dying; mouth and nose drawn, countenance hippocratic; almost unconscious.
There is painless stool in both, but Phosphoric acid has not the great prostration. In Phosphoric acid the stool is whitish gray, like dirty white paint; in Podophyllum it is yellow. Gratiola has a similar state of prostration, but the fluid is green water; when seen it looks like light shining through a green glass, sometimes thicker, like green-bile.
Abdomen: much bloated, tympanitic; great soreness of the bowels as if in a typhoid state. "White or yellow, watery diarrhea, chronic or acute, without pain or any marked debility or exhaustion".
It is uncommon for the stool to be yellow when watery. It is yellow when it is mushy; when watery it is light colored, sometimes milky. When yellow it is like corn meal mush, pappy; as in the typhoid state, thin like thin mush.
"Diarrhea; not prostrating; after catching cold during heat of summer; water; chronic; violent, bilious or mucous of twenty months standing; has the appearance of an old man; from acids in young persons who grow too rapidly; after eating, undigested; greenish white; painless."
When we have a diarrhea from adds we sometimes find symptoms running to Phosphoric acid. In the diarrhea from sour wine, such as claret, from acids, vinegar, lemons, be sure to study Antimonium crudum. This is a very striking feature of that remedy. Useful in cholera.
Male sexual organs. Sexual weakness, prolonged exhaustion, impotency; masturbators; nightly pollutions with great exhaustion,
"Prostatorrhoea; immediately after every erection discharge of prostatic fluid."
Even when passing a soft stool the prostatic fluid is discharged.
Falling-out of the hair is a striking feature; falling of the hair from the genitals, whiskers, eyebrows, head. It is closely related to Natrum, mur. and Selenium in falling out of the hair. Selenium has falling out of the hair

In all incurable cases after the fever has been reduced, Phosphorus should not be given, as it will intensify the fever and do just what it was given to avoid. It is not uncommon for a crisis to follow the administration of Phosphorus. Prolonged sweat and diarrhea, these should never be interfered with as they will soon stop of their own accord and the patient will be left in a state of quietude.
Phosphorus is a dangerous medicine to give very high in some cases of phthisis, in the last stages of phthisis. In this case they should have received Phosphorus when they were yet curable. In these cases Phosphorus 30 th may sometimes be used with safety and it will act as a test in doubtful cases to see whether reaction can be brought about. In such cases where reaction can be brought about the administration later of a still higher potency may be found useful, but in the beginning with Phosphorus in phthisical cases far advanced it is better not to go higher than the 30 th or 200 th.
Phosphorus very low will act as a poison in really Phosphorus cases and the only safety some patients have had who have received Phosphorus so very low was due to the fact that the Phosphorus was not similar enough to either kill or cure.

Great restlessness in the lower limbs; weariness in the lower limbs; weakness in the lower limbs, especially observed on walking, unsteady and trembling gait; paralysis of the lower limbs. Acute inflarnmation of the joints of the knees and hip joint.
Burning, tearing pains in the limbs from exposure to cold, Rheumatism of the joints and muscles; stiffness of the joints on becoming cold. All complaints of the limbs are ameliorated by heat, while complaints of the head and stomach are ameliorated by cold. The complaints of the chest are ameliorated by heat. The lower limbs are covered with foetid sweat, The lower limbs are gangrenous. Inflammation of the periosteum of the tibia. Ulcers upon the lower limbs; feet icy-cold.

Jerking and twitching of the muscles; spasms of the paralyzed parts. Epilepsy; convulsions; neuralgic pains of the various parts of the body and of the limbs especially, ameliorated by heat. It has cured multiple neuritis.
Sleep: Restless sleep; starts in sleep; feels in the morning as if he has not kept enough, yet most of the complaints and aches are ameliorated by sleep, especially the head symptoms; walks in his sleep.
He sleeps on the right side. Lying on the left side causes anxiety and pain in the heart and palpitation. Late falling to sleep in the evening; lies awake thinking about the affairs of the day and borrowing trouble. Phosphorus is a usual remedy in low forms of typhoid fever on the symptoms previously mentioned.
Skin: There are many eruptions in Phosphorus.
The eruptions are dry and scaly; dry furfuraceous herpes; blood blisters; purple spots; yellow spots on the chest and abdomen; formication and itching in the paralyzed parts; numbness of the skin; irregular brown spots upon the body; psoriasis of the knees, legs, elbows, and eyebrows; hives and blood boils; phlegmonous inflammation.
Chronic suppurating openings with hectic fever; fistulous openings; ulcers bleed on appearance of the menses; deep eating ulcers; indolent ulcers; malignant ulcers.
Very useful in cancerous ulcers that bleed and take on fungous appearance and in low forms of scarlet fever where the rash is very dusky or disappears and suppuration begins in various places about the neck or upon the extremities or upon the ends of the fingers and there is violent thirst for cold water, purple appearance in the throat, and dry, hacking, shaking cough.
Phytolacca
This is a very imperfectly proved remedy, and it is only possible to present fragments of it. The mental symptoms have not been brought out, but the remedy has some striking features.
You will notice the resemblance of this drug to Mercury, and it is an antidote to mercury. In those lingering mercurial bone pains, where the patient has been salivated; the pains come on at night from the warmth of the bed; the body aches; a chronic, sore, bruised state; soreness of the periosteum where the flesh is thin, over the tibia; joints; soreness of the muscles; drawing and cramping; drawing in the muscles of the back; backache, worse at night; worse from the warmth of the bed.
The patient suffers from these symptoms in cold, damp weather, as in Mercury. Tendency to ulceration, hence its usefulness in syphilis; old, chronic, syphilitic ulcers; the patient has been salivated; had Mercury rubbed in; he became saturated with it, but it no longer helps. Ulcers in the throat; on the skin; on mucous membranes anywhere.
Spasmodic conditions; drawing in the muscles; this may extend to violent spasms; opisthotonos; sometimes the cervical region is affected and the head is drawn back; jerking and twitching of the muscles.
Glands: Phytolacca is a glandular remedy.
The glands become inflamed, and hard. It produces sore throats, with inflammation of the glands of the neck, particularly the sub maxillary and parotid. Inflammation of the throat with the accumulation of thick, tenacious mucus; swelling of the tonsils. Low grade inflammation like erysipelas.
The symptoms are aggravation at night, on cold days, in a cold room, and from the heat of the bed; so that there is a controversy between heat and cold.
It seems that the remedy centres in the mammary glands. Soreness and lumps in the breasts from each cold, damp spell; becomes chilled and a sore breast results; sore breast in connection with the menses; a nursing woman is exposed to the cold, the breast inflames and the milk becomes stringy; coagulated milk.
This comes out in the proving, but poke root has been extensively used by cattle raisers when the cow's milk became thick and there were lumps in the bag, and when the condition was brought on from the cow standing out in the rain.
Almost any excitement centers in the mammary gland; fear or an accident; lumps form, pains, heat, swelling, tumefaction; even violent inflammation and suppuration. No other remedy in the Materia Medica centres so in the mammary gland. Mercury is similar; when the patient takes cold the glands become sore. If every tribulation makes the glands sore in a nursing woman, give her Phytolacca.
When a mother says she has no milk, or that the milk is scanty, thick, unhealthy; dries up soon; Phytolacca becomes then a constitutional remedy if there are no contra-indicating symptoms. A bloody watery discharge which continued for five years after weaning the infant was cured by Phyto. The breast is so sore that, when she nurses the child, she almost goes into spasms, with the pain extending down the back and limbs all over the body.
Diphtheria. In certain epidemics; great tumefaction of the throat; swelling of the glands of the neck, parotid and sub maxillary; aching in the bones; fetor from the mouth, with heavily coated tongue; great aching in the back; nose bleed; soreness of the muscles.
Analogous to Mercurius; they are closely related in diphtheria. At times in diphtheria we can only obtain the fetor, loaded tongue, exudation, swollen glands and stiff neck.
This looks like Mercurius or one of the Mercuries. The Protoiodide is right sided, and stays there or may go to the left side. The Biniodide goes from left to right. The Merc. cyanide has a thick, green membranous cast, extending from the nose to the throat. In Phytolacca we have many features of Mercury.
It has cured syphilitic nodes on the skull and shin bones.
Skin: Many eruptions.
"Squamous eruptions; Pityriasis, psoriasis."
"Ringworm."
"Barber's itch."
"Rash on body; measles; scarlet eruptions all over the body."
It is not surprising that it cures scarlatina, as it has this scarlet rash, the sore throat and glandular involvement.
It has the ability to delay the formation of malignant growths, especially in the breast; glandular tumors that become hard and scirrhous. Until this remedy was known there was but one remedy for the old cicatrices in the mammary gland. Women who were confined years before, had abscesses of the breast which were poulticed and lanced had a cicatrix left, and now in the present confinement they have trouble; inflammation in the old cicatrices; ulceration which eats off the lacteal glands or turns the ducts aside and twists them; high inflammation - throbbing and pain; milk bloody.
Graphites was the old routine remedy, but Phytolacca, is a better remedy and suits the general concomitants oftener. The symptoms usually found in an inflamed breast after confinement are: aching in the back and bone pains; fever and shivering.
Phytolacca has these and falls into the very nature of the case. Graphites has it only in a limited way. if there is high fever; congestion to the head; throbbing carotids; much redness, and the redness radiates from the nipple, Belladonna is the remedy.
When the entire gland is as heavy as a stone, and hard, and the patient is sensitive to motion and touch, Bryonia. Mercury when the general symptoms agree. Hepar and Silicea after suppuration is inevitable, especially when the only comfort is obtained from heat. Hepar when there is extreme pain and soreness, irritability and this relief from heat; it limits the extent of the suppuration and opens the part without pain.
Nose: The most distressing, lingering, inveterate, old catarrhs with destruction of the bones of the nose.
"Total obstruction of the nose: when riding, must breathe through the mouth."
"Coryza and cough, with redness of eyes and lachrymation; photophobia; feeling of sand in the eyes, with soreness and burning.”
"Syphilitic ozaena, with bloody, sanious discharge and disease of bone." "Noli me tangere and cancerous affections of nose."
It is somewhat like Graphites, in that it seeks out fissures in which to establish inflammation, induration and eruptions. Where the circulation is feeble it has the tendency to establish induration.
"Face sunken, pale, hippocratic; blue around eyes; yellowish complexion; looking blue and suffering . Pains in bones of head and face at night."
"Swelling around left ear and side of face like erysipelas; thence over scalp; very painful."
"Lips everted and firm. Tetanus.”
"Ulcers on lips."
"Parotid and sub maxillary glands swollen."
"Tongue thickly coated on back; coated yellow and dry."
This is found in all acute complaints and is like Mercury. Phytolacca holds a reputation among the Eclectics, and in their results we see a shadow of its homeopathic action. In Cincinnati they used three drops in a tumbler of water and gave it for ulcers in the mouth. It was a standard remedy with them and they made some homoeopathic cures.
"Ulcerated sore mouth." Syphilitic ulcers find a curative remedy in Phytolacca, when the symptoms agree.
Throat: There are several pages in the Guiding Symptoms showing homeopathic cures of the throat; diphtheria; sore throat; inflamed glands; aching bones worse at night, violent cases, with difficult swallowing, pains in the tonsils; enlarged tonsils; tendency to slough. Syphilitic and mercurial sore throats. The sore throats are often aggravated from warm drinks; he wants cool things; and there is an aggravation at night.
Here is a summary:
"Diphtheria; sick and dizzy when trying to sit up; frontal headache; pains shooting from throat into ears, especially on trying to swallow; face flushed; tongue much coated, protruded; thickly coated at back, fiery red at tip; breath foetid; putrid; vomiting; difficulty of swallowing; tonsils swollen, covered with membrane, first upon left; three or four patches; tonsils, uvula and back part of throat covered with ash-colored exudation. Pain in the root 'of the tongue on putting out."
Pains: Old gout and rheumatism of the limbs; in acute rheumatism which is prolonged, worse at night, worse from the warmth of the bed, worse from warm applications.
Gouty rheumatism; syphilitic cases; pains as if in the bones.
"Sharp cutting pains in hip, drawing; legs drawn up; cannot touch floor." "Syphilitic or gonorrheal sciatica, etc."
"Ulcers and nodes on the legs."
A certain class of physicians used to call Podophyllum "vegetable Mercury.”
Phytolacca ought to be called "vegetable Mercury” because it is so full of symptoms analogous to Mercury.
Picricum Acidum
Mind: The weakness of body and mind is the first impression wrought upon the mind of the reader who goes carefully over this proving.
It is progressive, passing from weariness to paralysis. The evidences of softening of brain and cord are strong. He, soon becomes sensitive to heat and desires the cool air which ameliorates his head and bodily condition.
Cold air and cold bathing are grateful to him. He is sensitive to wet weather. Numbness of many parts, trembling, lassitude, heaviness, must lie down, worse from least exertion are marked features. Loss of sleep, mental, worry, mental labor, are the exciting causes of symptoms. Extreme indifference.
It is a typical brain-fag remedy with indifference and lack of will power, aversion to talk, think, or perform any mental exertion. He is quickly prostrated from the least mental work, and it brings on many complaints, such as soreness and lameness, diarrhea, burning along the spine, general weakness and heaviness of limbs and back. He loses all interest in things; becomes irritable from any mental exertion.
Head: In young school children we have a common use for this very valuable but neglected remedy. When the child begins to learn the alphabet, headaches come, and return with every repeated effort, often with dilated pupils. After every examination at school come these violent headaches. A young man at school with the following symptoms was cured promptly.
Student's headache, vertigo when remaining standing, heaviness in the head, epistaxis, dilated pupils, congestion of conjunctiva, inability to bear artificial light, loss of appetite, bitter taste in mouth, vomiting, jaundice. Vertigo from mental exertion, lameness from stooping, walking, ascending, from raising the head from the pillow, can not sit up, soon nausea comes from it.
It is often associated with the head pains, For headaches of students, teachers, professional men, and overworked business men, it is a most useful remedy. For headaches with great nervous weakness from grief and de pressing emotions, it has been often overlooked.
It has violent pain in vertex, forehead and occiput, extending down the spine with much heat. Congestive headaches. The head must be cool, it is worse from warm room, and wrapping up the head or body, and better from rest of mind and body.
The headaches often begin and increase with the day, and are better by sleep at night. The patient is wholly incapacitated in the daytime, but comfortable from rest and sleep during the night. Extreme prostration often comes with these headaches. Extreme sexual excitement often comes with the headache as with many of its "complaints," but it is not an essential concomitant.
Eyes: The eye symptoms are due to loss of tone in the eye muscles of such as are suffering from brain fag. Looking, reading We print and exertion of vision will bring on the headache and eye symptoms (Onosmodium).
Sensation of sand in the eye, smarting, acrid tears, sparks, fag before the eyes, near sighted, dim vision, objects confused, pupils dilated, severe pain over eyes. Thick mucus in eyes.
The symptoms from the eye arc worse from artificial light.
Small boils and pustules in external auditory canal.
Digestion: Eructations, abortive, sour.
Nausea in the morning worse on rising and moving about. There is evidence of liver trouble, and the patient is jaundiced. Rumbling in the abdomen, diarrhea from mental exertion.
Yellow, watery or thin faecal, oily stool; smarting after stool; stool like yellow cornmeal gruel. Great weakness after stool, in debilitated persons.
Urine contains sugar and albumen, Urine of high specific gravity. Urine heavy with urates, uric acid, phosphates, and poor in sulphates. Dribbling after urination. Weakness of the bladder. Great waste of phosphates.
In the proving it turns the normal sexual sphere into lust, and salacity with violent erections, especially during the night. It has many times cured these symptoms even when of long standing.
Pain in occiput and spine, heaviness of limbs and sexual excitement. Where great restlessness of feet is present the Zincum Picricum acts better. It cures impotency and spermatorrhea when the mind is unable to control the lustful state.
Burning heat in the spine from mental or physical exertion. Weakness of the spine and heaviness of the limbs, especially the lower limbs. The back is so tired that he cannot sit up erect, he must slide down in the chair or lie down. He is relieved while lying. It has been very useful in myelitis, with the weak limbs and a sensation as if body and limbs were bandaged or constricted; also with anesthesia of legs and as if he had on elastic stockings.
In locomotor ataxia where there are tormenting erections and emissions as soon as he falls asleep, Many cases of spinal weakness have been cured by this remedy.
Weakness of the lower limbs with trembling, numbness and constriction. Formication and prickling as from needles. Marked coldness of the feet. Physical exertion greatly intensifies all these symptoms after long rest he is ameliorated.
Tired after least exertion in limbs and whole body; excessive lassitude. Great muscular weakness. Sleepiness in day-time and sleepless at night, especially after mental labor.
Platinum
The Platinum proving represents the woman's mind perverted.
It is especially suited to hysterical women such as have undergone fright, prolonged excitement, or from disappointment, shock, or prolonged hemorrhages. She becomes arrogant and haughty.
Mind: One of the most striking characteristics of this drug is pride and over-estimate of one’s self. She imagines that she is of a high born family and that her friends and relatives are of lowly origin and looks down upon them.
Her acquaintances are inferior to herself. A strange thing about this remedy is that this imagination extends to the body. She imagines that her body is large and that the bodies of other people are smaller in comparison with her own. She is in a contemptuous mood, anxious and serious over matters that. are not serious, irritable about trifling things, is moody and sulky over slight vexations, anxious, weeping. Palpitation, trembling in all limbs during every little excitement, fears death and loathes life.
Fear is a very prominent feature in this remedy. Fears that something will happen, fears that her absent husband will never return to her, though he comes back regularly. Restless disposition, excitable, walking, moving about, and weeping.
The mental symptoms alternate with the physical symptoms. Strange illusions of fancy. Imagines than she do, not belong to this race and becomes insane over religious matters, sits in the corner and broods and says nothing. Takes on insanity; becomes a sexual pervert, utters unchaste speech and trembles.
Spasms will come on from vexation or anger. Whistles, sings, and dances. Talks constantly about fanciful things. She may go into melancholy or into mania. Any disturbance of her pride will bring on her symptoms.
Sexual excitement will bring on her symptoms. The usual mental symptoms are intermingled with trembling of the limbs, sexual excitement, and numbness of various parts of the body and limbs. Compressing sensations, pressing pains, pressure of the limbs as if bandaged or constricted, tension of the skin of the limbs as if bandaged.
Head: These characteristic features prevail throughout the various regions of the body and modify many particulars.
Sensation of numbness of the scalp with, pressing pain in the head, boring, compression of the head. Tension of the scalp, cramplike constrictions of the scalp gradually increasing to violence, cramplike pains gradually increasing to violence.
Squeezing sensation in the head. These pains may be in the temple, in the top of the head, or in the forehead. Again, there is crawling, creeping, numbness of the scalp. Sudden shocks in the head. There is no symptom in the head more persistent than numbness of the scalp, it prevails throughout all sensations and pains.
All headaches gradually increase until they are severe. Violent neuralgia in the head with sensitiveness in hysterical persons. Sometimes numbness in the head is described as if the brain were numb. Headaches come on from chagrin, from fear, from vexation, from hemorrhages, and from sexual excitement.
Eyes: Sparks before the eyes, spasms of the lids, and objects appear smaller than they really are. Sensation of coldness in the eyes, spasms, spasmodic trembling and twitching of the muscles of the eyes.
Ears: Cramping pain in the ears, coldness in the ears, numbness of the external ears.
The numbness of the ears extends to the face, nose and scalp. Platinum is a hemorrhagic remedy. Bleeding from various parts of the body and mucous membranes. The hemorrhages wherever observed are black clots with fluid. On examining the symptoms of the nose hemorrhage is observed. Black, coagulated blood from the nose. Oversensitive to smell. Violent crampy pains at the root of the nose with redness of the face.

Tension of the skin of the abdomen. Violent, cramping pains in the abdomen, drawing pains in the navel as if by a string, which causes a sensation of retraction of the abdomen. Pressing, bearing down pains in the abdomen.
These pains are much like Plumbum and Platinum, has been used as an antidote to Plumbum. Pressing, drawing pains from incarcerated flatus. The torpor of the intestinal canal is much like that which is found in Plumbum. Inveterate constipation, much flatus.
The stool is half digested and papescent or hard as if burnt, or may be scanty and very difficult, or may be glutinous and adherent to the anus like soft clay. Frequent urging to stool and inability to strain at stool, inveterate constipation and unsuccessful urging to stool.

Aching pains, burning pains and protrusion of hemorrhoids during stool. Burning in the rectum during stool. Itching, tickling, and tenesmus of the anus, especially in the evening.
Genitalia: Extreme sexual erethism is found in both male and female.
In the male there is great sexual erethism driving to secret vice. It has cured epilepsy arising from onanism. Sexual erethism is one of the most prominent features of Platinum, in women. Unbearable sexual excitement and voluptuous crawling in the genitals.
Such extreme sensitiveness of the external genitals that it is impossible for the woman to wear a napkin during menstruation. Such extreme sensitiveness of the vagina that it is impossible for the physician to make an examination with the index finger. It is not an inflammation but a hyperesthesia.
Increased sexual excitement in young girls, in hysterical girls. Violent sexual desire in married women with itching, tingling, and voluptuous sensations.

The menstrual flow comes too early, is too profuse, and then generally of short duration. The hemorrhage is somewhat like the menstrual flow in old women. The menstrual periods sometimes return every fourteen days or the menstrual flow may be entirely absent. The vulva and vagina are extremely sensitive during coition, sometimes preventing the act.
The woman suffers from albuminous leucorrhoea, mostly in the daytime without much sensation. There are many complaints of pregnancy, threatened abortion, exhausting hemorrhages, discharges of black clotted blood.
During labor the contractions are interrupted by sensitiveness of the vagina and internal parts. It is impossible for the obstetrician to make the usual examination. Cramping in the limbs during parturition or profuse hemorrhage; hysterical convulsions, puerperal convulsions.

Plumbum Metallicum
This drug illustrates a doctrine of Hahnemann: the doctrine of attenuation.
Generalities: When you think of the insolubility of lead, and then think of it as spread on the wall of a room, and then remember how many become sick from sleeping in a newly painted room, you will then wonder how much lead it took to make them sick.
Many patients cannot sleep in a newly painted room - they come down with lead colic or the acute affections of lead. Many people are sensitive to lead. This sensitivity is more marked than is observed in painters, who may use it for years with impunity, but all at once become susceptible to it.
You wonder how much he gets, given off in the air. It is too attenuated to be examined by the microscope and yet enough to make him sick.
We have no measure by which to find out how much he gets. We make use of such susceptibility, the lead palsy of lead workers, the lead colic in painters - these things add to the proper proving and give a well- rounded image of Plumbum.
General paralytic state: If we study the whole symptomatology of Plumbum, we will be struck with the general paralytic state in this remedy.
The activities of the body, the functions of the organs, are slowed down in pace. The nerves do not convey their messages with the usual activity. The muscles are slow in action, sluggish. There is first paresis and finally paralysis, of parts first and finally of the whole.
The mind is impaired, slow. Perception is slow. He memorizes with difficulty. Comprehension is difficult. He cannot recall words to express himself. The operations of the mind are slow. When in conversation with such a patient you will wonder what he is thinking about while making up his mind to answer.
There is sluggishness also in the skin. You may prick him and a second later he says, "Oh", showing the slowness in feeling. You would expect him to feel the prick instantly. When you begin to conclude that he does not feel at all, his limb will jerk.
Anesthesia of the skin. There is a state of hyperesthesia in the acute affections, but the chronic affections are characterized by loss of sensation. Numbness of fingers and toes, soles, and palms, and this extends to the skin, towards the spine.
The trophic functions are slow in that they do not keep up with the waste, and so we see emaciation until the patient becomes almost a skeleton. The skin is wrinkled, puckered, shriveled, and drawn over the bones. The emaciation is sometimes local.
When local it is generally associated with a painful part; the painful part withers. Pains down the sciatic nerve; burning, shooting; as if the bone were being pulled out of place; as if being scraped and the limb emaciates. Pain down the arm, in the shoulder; violent pains in the brachial plexus and the arm withers.
Neuralgia of one side of the face and that side withers. Paralysis of single muscles and these muscles wither. There is, paralysis of both extensors and flexors, but especially extensors. The paralysis begins in the extensors, so that we have wrist drop. He cannot raise or lift anything with the hand. Extension is difficult. This occurs in piano players; they cannot lift their fingers sufficiently rapid to keep up the pace, while flexion is all right. Curare is another remedy which corresponds to this state in piano players; a paralysis from overexertion of the extensor muscles.
When the muscles become fatigued from playing fixed exercises, scales, etc., for hours at a time, when the player has to do the same thing over and over again, Rhus comes in, but it is an acute remedy and only holds for a short time.
It is especially a Rhus condition when certain muscles become overused and the patient takes cold anda weakness sets in; after a cold bath or plunge the muscles take on paresis; getting wet when tired brings on the Rhus state.
For the chronic state which follows, Plumbum and sometimes Curare will be indicated.
Paresis of the intestines; constipation; cannot strain at stool. The patient can use the abdominal muscles, but the rectum is in a state of paresis and he cannot expel the faeces.
The bladder is also paretic; cannot expel the urine, the muscles do not cooperate to void the urine and there is retention. Plumbum has both retention and suppression of urine.
The paralyses are found in the chronic state. In the acute we have the fever, the colic, the sudden constipation; tearing pains in the intestines; indigestion with vomiting. Everything eaten turns sour.
Violent vomiting of everything eaten. Chronic gastric catarrh with vomiting of albuminous mucus and sweetish substance. Vomiting of stercoraceous matter, blackish blood and green fluid. Sour eructations.
The remedy is slow and insidious; it works continuously; it does not leave the economy but holds on and establishes a miasm of its own. It, therefore, suits slow and insidious chronic cases, with no tendency to recovery. Progressive muscular atrophy; progressive paralysis. Chronic constipation; chronic retention of urine; chronic giving way of the mind.
Aside from the slowness of the mind, which is a general, the remedy is full of melancholia, sadness, feeling as if something terrible would happen; that she has sinned away the day of grace; that she has committed the unpardonable sin. The body and mind are weak.
"Deep melancholy with timidity and restlessness,"
In the mental state, while he is slow to think, yet in this slow thinking he does a great amount of thinking; he makes an effort to think. His thoughts trouble him all night and prevent sleep. Insomnia; sleepless from the continual effort to think.
The mind will not operate, yet the patient is full of imaginations and emotions. Inability to comprehend and to remember. Now, this progresses from periods of insomnia to periods of coma and this coma is associated with suppression of urine.
Uraemic coma. Uremia. Perhaps it will fix it in your mind if I tell you something clinical about it. Some years ago a physician came to me in regard to his wife. She had been unconscious for two days and had passed no urine for days and the catheter showed there was none in the bladder. She had quite an array of symptoms but they were common symptoms.
She had had the slowness for days before, and complained of a sensation of a continual pulling at the navel, as if a string were drawing it back to the spinal column, and then the coma came on. In the middle of the night this doctor came to me in great distress. He said she was pale as death and breathing slow. A single powder of Plumbum high was given, and she passed urine in a few hours, roused up and never had such an attack again.
Violent spasmodic palpitation of the heart, worse lying on the left side, with marked anxiety in the cardiac region. Hypertrophy and dilatation of the heart. Stitching pain in the heart.
Hysterical diathesis hysterical contractures; cramping of the fingers; hysterical motions convulsions of parts, hands, feet, whole body; an apparent delirium; cardiac pains; numbness in parts - all hysterical phenomena.
Plumbum produces an inclination to deceive, to cheat. The Acetate of lead produced in a woman, who took a little of it for suicide, a confirmed hysterical state. She would be in a hysterical condition for hours when any one was looking at her. When she thought no one was near she would get up, walk about, look in the glass to see how handsome she was, but when she heard a foot on the steps she would, he on the bed and appear to he unconscious.
She would bear much pricking and you could scarcely tell she was breathing. Plumbum establishes a hysterical state in the economy; an inclination to deceive, to feign sickness; to exaggerate one's ills; and it goes to the root of the evil providing the symptoms agree.
Changeable; continually changing from one thing to another, from one group of imaginations to another, from one group of emotions to another. The whole remedy is intensely emotional. While the intellect is slowed down, yet most of the symptoms are emotional.
Plumbum cures kidney affections with albumen and sugar in the urine. The urine is dark, scanty, and of high specific gravity. Retention of urine from lack of sensation that the bladder is full.
Apoplexy. Stupor, when Opium is sufficiently similar to remove the cerebral congestion which always surrounds the apoplectic clot, Plumbum may follow. Plumbum, Phosphorus and Alumina are three sheet anchors.
They conform to the symptoms often when the first state as been like Opium. The paralysis of muscles, the paralytic weakness of one side of the body, or single parts of the body, show its relation to such cases.
There is another feature of the upper part of the body, of the head and mind, which is not clear in the books and which is worthy of your attention. The mental symptoms, the emotional symptoms, and the head symptoms are greatly exaggerated by any exertion, especially exertion in the open air.
While walking in the open air the patient becomes hot in the head, pale in the face, and cold in the extremities, hands and feet cold as ice, as if dead; and if he continues the exertion the face becomes fairly cadaveric. Persons cannot exercise and continue it without cold extremities.
An irritable brain; pain in the base of the brain, back of the neck, in the nerve centers. Cold extremities from exertion; yet can do considerable mental exertion without becoming cold. It is from physical exertion like walking in the open air. Paroxysmal pain in the limbs, evening and night; better by pressure and worse from motion. Lightning-like pains. Jerking and trembling of all the limbs.
The Plumbum patient is cold and emaciated, needs much clothing even in warm weather, not about the head, but over the body. Extremities cold, blue, numb and emaciated. Sweat on the extremities, and on the feet it is stinking. Feet and toes withered like a washerwoman's hands. Toes blistered; blisters between the toes, smarting. Ulcerations. Molecular death and even gangrene of the skin of the fingers and toes. Calluses
about the feet, corns and bunions.
With the chronic affection of the head there is contraction of the muscles of the back and neck; drawing and twitching indicating meningeal troubles; spasmodic jerking.
"Swelling of the submaxillary and sublingual glands."
Convulsions often like tetanus, with lockjaw.
"Distinct blue line along the margins of the gums."
"Gums pale, swollen, show a lead-colored line; blue, purple, or brown; painful with hard tubercles."
"Tongue dry, brown, cracked; coated yellow or green; dry, red, glazed in chronic gastritis."
Breath foetid, dryness of mouth, ulceration, aphthae. "Sensation of a plug in the throat; globus hystericus." "Paralysis of throat and inability to swallow," a paralysis of the oesophagus.
The stomach has no ability to digest food. Assimilation is also destroyed. Pains in the abdomen, tearing, like colic, doubling the patient up. Constant sensation of pulling at the navel as by a string; as if the abdomen were drawn in. At times the abdomen does become concave, as if the abdomen and back were too close together.
Constipation is a common and well known feature. The constipation, colic, and abdominal symptoms are commonly associated.
"Constipated stools, hard, lumpy like sheep’s dung; with urging and terrible pain from constriction or spasms of anus; knotty faeces in form of balls."
No matter how much straining he cannot expel the stool.
"Constriction of intestines; navel and anus violently retracted."
"Excessive pain in abdomen radiating from thence to all parts of the body."
"Severe colic; contracted abdomen; bends backward, motor nerves most affected."
Rumbling and flatulence. Impaction of faeces. Vaginismus in keeping with the spasmodic action. "Inclination to take strange attitudes and positions in bed."
"Anemia, chlorosis, emaciation, muscular atrophy, wandering pains, dropsical swellings, yellow skin, jaundice."
Burning in ulcers is in keeping with the remedy everywhere.
Podophyllum
This remedy is seldom used except in acute affections, but it is a long acting and deep acting drug; it produces a powerful impression on the economy; it relates to the deep-seated miasms.
Abdomen: It affects profoundly the abdominal viscera. It shows its symptoms largely on the abdominal organs, the pelvic organs, and the liver. The abdomen seems to be the earliest seat of attack. It produces such an impression upon the stomach and intestinal canal that the healthy action is impaired, digestion and assimilation cease.
Everything taken into the stomach becomes sour. The glands of the stomach are as if paralyzed; there is no digestion; this goes on until we have vomiting and diarrhea. During this there is a wonderful disturbance in
the abdomen; rumbling; gurgling as if animals were floundering about; clinically, as if fish were turning and tossing in a pond, as we have seen them before a storm.
Rumbling and rolling. This is attended with severes cramping pains doubling her up. Abdomen is sensitive; so sore she cannot endure pressure. The soreness extends to the stomach, intestines and finally to the liver. The whole abdominal viscera are sore, sensitive to pressure. After this comes a gurgling, watery stool, pouring out of the anus.
A tremendous outpouring so that the patient wonders where all the fluid comes from, and soon it comes on again. Copious, enormous, and very frequent. This soreness, cramping, and rumbling precedes the stool, but sometimes it continues during the stool. Commonly the patient is relieved by the stool. There is much flatus and spluttering, but not so marked as in Aloe.
The colic often comes and goes without stool. Painless stools, in which compare China which has stool coming on at night and after eating. Putrid or not, and of inky color. Podophyllum is rarely indicated when the discharge is not offensive. After a while the abdomen again becomes tumultuous, and this is again relieved by a stool.
This process is repeated over and over. It seems as if the blood vessels would empty themselves into the! abdominal cavity, and then into the outer world. Not unlike cholera and cholera morbus, and these two are the common manifestations of disease for which this remedy is used in routine practice. The cholera morbus coming on in the latter part of the night, especially about 3, 4, or 5 o'clock, resembles Podophyllum. Tumultuous action of the bowels with rumbling, pain, and soreness, and the prostration is so marked that if not relieved in a day or two, it seems he must die. Rice-water stools, jelly-like on standing.
Women: With this tumultuous action, she has an indescribable sensation; an all-gone feeling, a deathly sick feeling, described by some as an emptiness, as if fasting, yet averse to food. An awful, hungry, empty weakness, as if the whole intestines would drop out.
No wonder they think so, because this remedy produces an astonishing amount of relaxation. Described by some as a sensation of dragging down. The uterine ligaments become relaxed and there is prolapsus. The rectum protrudes for inches. The sensation of dragging down as if all the parts would be pushed out into the world is a common feature. It seems to begin with the liver, as if all the parts were let down. Weakness attended with soreness.
Dragging down in the region of the ovary and the ovary is congested. The uterus is extremely sore and is enlarged; sore to touch so that light clothing aggravates. Sensitiveness of the abdomen in diarrhea and vomiting; in cholera morbus; in women when menstruating. Indicated if there is a copious diarrhea during the menstrual period, and great soreness in the uterus. Much pain in the ovaries, in one or both, extending down the crural region, down the front of the thigh.
Pain in the ovaries, especially the right; pain in the ovaries during the menstrual period, gripping pain in the bowels during the menstrual period. Great soreness of the abdomen before and during the menstrual period. (Apis, Cimicifuga, Vespa, Lachesis, but these are not so likely to have diarrhea and, if so, it is not as copious.)
Diarrhea: Alternating conditions is a feature of this remedy. If a Podophyllum patient takes cold, has any mental excitement, overexerts himself, eats boiled food, cabbage, fruits, and overloads his stomach with rich food he has a diarrhea, and following this a constipation lasting for weeks, no stool except in lumps; difficult, scanty stool and as soon as lie disorders Ids stomach again comes a diarrhea. This alternating
diarrhea and constipation is a Podophyllum state rather than a chronic diarrhea, which is a continued state found in many remedies. The diarrhea is periodic, alternating with constipation.
Headache: Another alternating feature is the headache.
Chronic headache, periodic headache, sick headache, congestive in character, as if all the blood were in the head, as if the head would burst, and the pains most violent in the back of the head, bursting, and then on comes a diarrhea which relieves the head.
Sometimes when the diarrhea slacks up too suddenly, a headache is the result. It is a common feature after giving a high potency of Podophyllum in a diarrhea, that a headache comes, on after the diarrhea is stopped. It means that the medicine has acted suddenly and the headache will pass away soon.
Headache alternating with liver disturbances. The patient lies on the side or abdomen. Rending pains towards the duodenum. You will wonder if it is not gall stone colic. Periodic, violent headaches; alternating diarrhea and constipation; he strokes the region of the liver from behind forward and in this way gets relief, yet the liver is so sore that he can hardly bear the pressure.
Liver sensitive to touch.
Soreness about the liver; pain through to the back; dull aching pain, finally jaundice; becomes extremely yellow. Uneasiness and distress about two or three hours after eating, with jaundice; horrible nausea; aversion to food; empty all-gone feeling in the bowels.
Vomiting, greenish, profuse, watery, vomits everything; vomiting of milk (Calc., Aeth. - the latter sometimes retains water); hunger after vomiting; deathly, overpowering nausea and prostration. Prolapse of rectum and anus during vomiting. (Mur. ac.). A condition commonly called duodenal catarrh; a chronic state; rouses into a Podophyllum diarrhea every once in a while.
Mental symptoms troublesome.
A torpid liver is often associated with a torpid fluctuating state of the mind; also a slow, sluggish pulse; palpitation. Great depression of spirits, melancholia, sadness, dejection everything goes wrong; the clouds are very dark; there is no light; thinks he may die or that he is going to become ill; that his disease will become chronic; that he has organic disease of the heart and liver; that he has sinned away his day of grace, and other such delusions. Mind easily fatigued; fidgety and restless; cannot sit still, whole body fidgety.
In this mental state with jaundice, all-gone sensation, aversion to food, even the thought or smell of food; stuffed feeling and distension in the region of the liver. The tongue is covered with thick slime; pasty, yellow coating as if mustard were spread upon it; imprint of the teeth upon the tongue; breath foul. For such a condition the ancients gave Calomel.
Gallstone colic; enlargement of the liver; gastric weakness; unable to digest; duodenal catarrh; catarrh of intestines with copious diarrhea. If you notice the Podophyllum discharge in the commode, you will see a great amount of water, on the bottom a sediment like cornmeal gruel; as if cornmeal had been stirred in. If you see it early it is yellow, muddy, or yellow-green, profuse, offensive, cadaverous; the odor penetrates the whole house; stool gushes away like water from a bung-bole; gurgling and much flatus.
With the stool there is very commonly a prolapse of the rectum; a gush of watery stool and a prolapse of the rectum; a soft stool with great straining and a prolapse of the rectum.
Prolapsus of the uterus; prominent are Murex, Sepia, Natrum mur. Sepia is better sitting or lying; worse walking. Aversion to coition; hot flushes; constipation with sense of lump in the rectum, or better by stool. Murex has the following. The only relief is to press on the vulva; not better lying down; she then has pains in the back and hips compelling her to walk, yet his aggravates. Strong sexual desire. Pain in right ovary, which crosses entire body to left breast. Pain shooting up in the uterus.
The word bile is a striking feature in Podophyllum, You must connect the vomiting and the stool with this color. The patient declares he is "bilious;” his liver is out of order;" bitter taste in the mouth; spitting up bile and the color is yellow; in diarrhea it is a green substance.
In children subject to copious diarrhea, with prolapsus of the anus no other symptom, Podophyllum often cures.
A feature of infancy is the following: child may not have diarrhea, may even be constipated, but it lies in bed and rolls the head in sleep. Bell. and Apis roll head.
Apis lies on back with the head on its side, Chewing motion of the jaws; sometimes a sucking; a grinding of the teeth in those who are old and have teeth; rolling the head from side to side; if you lift the eyelids you will find a strabisms.
Provers felt as if the eyes were drawn inward. It has cured such a strabismus in congestion of the brain following a suddenly suppressed diarrhea.
A child who should have a colored stool has instead a white one like chalk (Calc. c.). in adults, a bileless, white stool.
The body is offensive; offensive sweat; compare Sepia, Merc., Aloe, Sulph., Murex, Nux.
Psorinum
Psorinum is closed allied to Sulphur.
Skin: The patient dreads to be washed. The skin over the body, especially of the face, looks filthy, though it has been well washed. A dingy, dirty, foul look, as if covered with dirt.
Skin rough and uneven, cracks easily, bleeding fissures; it becomes rough and scaly. He cannot wash it clean. The skin of the hands is rough, chaps easily, becomes thick and scaly, easily cracks; breaks out in little scaly, eruptions; looks unwashed; he always appears to have dirty hands.
Many of the complaints of the skin are worse from bathing and from the warmth of the bed. The skin itches when warm; itches when wearing woolens. Itching when warm in bed; he scratches until the part becomes raw, and then it becomes scabby. When healing takes place there is itching and then it becomes scabby. When healing takes place there is itching and then he has to scratch. Legs and arms raw and scabby from scratching. Violent itching from the warmth of the bed, even, without any eruption.
The skin is unhealthy, looks dirty, dingy, studded with capillary blood vessels and enlarged veins. This is the state before the eruption appears. Scabs form from scratching and then comes the eruption.
Papules, pimples, crusts, boils, vesicles, and eruptions ooze a watery moisture. When the eruption has gone on for some time the crusty formation and vesicles mingle; the skin becomes thickened and indurated, and new crops come out under the old crusts; rawness, itching, tingling, crawling, bleeding eczema of the scalp and face; the crusts cover the scalp; the hair falls out; the oozing lifts up the crusts and exposes new vesicles; it looks like raw beef, and it tingles so that the child cannot keep its fingers off it; worse at night, worse from the warmth of the bed, worse from warm applications, anything that would keep the air away from it; ameliorated by cool air and worse from covering. This is the opposite of the general Psorinum state, which is aggravated from the open air. He has an aversion to open air.
The eruption goes on, spreads, and the true skin becomes elevated, thickened, indurated, with an increased vascularity and redness. The oozing is offensive like carrion or decomposed meat; nauseating odor from the oozing fluid.
Offensiveness runs through Psorinum in such a characteristic way that is worth while mentioning it here; foetid odors, foetid breath discharges and oozing from the skin smelling like carrion; stool so offensive that the odor permeates the whole house, in diarrhea, summer complaint, cholera infantum; perspiration foetid; leucorrhoea abominably offensive; eructations taste as if be had eaten bard boiled eggs and they had spoiled, and they smell so to others; stool flatus, and eructations smell like spoiled eggs; offensive to sight and smell is the subject who needs this medicine.
The skin grows increasingly thick and bleeds, and the eruption spreads to other parts. Eruptions on the lips, on the genitals; very offensive; soreness and rawness about the anus; the vulva ulcerates and is very offensive; ulcers on the legs; on the tibia; on the backs of the hands; on the dorsum of the foot; behind the ears and upon the ears; over the scalp; over the cheek bones; on the wings of the nose and on the nose and eyelids.
Greasy skin. The eruption is accompanied by redness of the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth, lips and eyes. Eyelids thickened and turned out, like ectropion; granulation and induration of mucous membranes, so that they become like gristle; redness and ulceration. Ulceration of the cornea; lachrymation; turning out of the lids with loss of the eyelashes.
Eyes and nose: He looks frightful with his red eyes, eruption on the face, red skin oozing a thick yellow discharge. In the early stages the oozing is a whitish thin or whitish thick moisture. In old eruptions ulceration takes place beneath the crusts and there is a thick, yellow, purulent discharge. Yellow green discharge from the eyes and nose. Horribly offensive discharge from the nose; gluey discharge from the nose; offensive like Merc., Sil., Calc. p., Hep.
Accumulation of foetid pus in the eyes. Coryza with thick, yellow discharge. Always taking cold. In the coryza, the nose dries up part of the time and runs part of the time; he must use the handkerchief continually; must blow the nose all the time.
In the early stages of the coryza he blows it all the time, but there is no discharge or relief. This state is so marked that some think of it as a continuous hay fever, which runs all the year and rippens up in the Fall.
It is closely related to hay fever; stuffing up of the nose in the Fall; catarrhal state of the eyes and nose. Hay fever is one of the most difficult conditions to fit a remedy to. It belongs to a low constitution which must be built up before the hay fever will cease.
It is an expression of psora which comes once a year, and the psoric miasm must be changed. In a few years most subjects can be changed, but not in one season, so do not be disappointed. In catarrhal states, hay fever often dates back to low fever improperly treated.
The Psorinum patient himself is one of debility. He wants to go home after a short walk. He is worse in the open air. He cannot breathe in the open air; cannot breathe while he is standing up; wants to go home and lie down so that he can breathe.
Asthma: or cardiac dyspnoea, when the patient wants to go home and lie down so that he can breathe. Usually this condition is relieved by sitting up and from the open air. Not so with Psorinum, he wants a warm place and to he down and to be let alone.
Psorinum is slowed down in all of its functions; a state of paretic weakness. He does not rally after a fever; his digestion is slow; the stool is normal, yet it requires a great effort to expel it; the bladder is full of urine, yet it passes slowly and he feels that some remains; he can never finish stool or urination; he has to go back several times. Although the stool is soft and perfectly normal it cannot be expelled at one sitting.
A psoric patient comes down with typhoid; the typhoid has been arrested or has run its course and it is time for convalescence. The fever has subsided, but the patient has no appetite; he does not convalesce; he wants to lie down and does no desire to, be moved; he is worse when sitting up, lies upon his back; he has troublesome breathing and lies with his arms abducted from his side, thrown across the bed; this relieves his breathing and allows the chest to operate properly; so tired and so weak; one dose of Psorinum will cause a reaction, stop his sweat, increase his appetite, cause better breathing.
The Psorinum complex of symptoms is one in which remedies cause improvement but a short time and then the symptoms change and another remedy must be selected. It is a state of feeble reaction.
Mind: The mental symptoms present some strong features. Sadness, hopeless; he sees no light breaking through the clouds above his head; all is dark about him.
He thinks his business is going to be a failure; that he is going to the poor house; that he has sinned away his day of grace. It is a fixed idea during the day and he dreams about it at night. Overwhelming sadness; dejection; he takes no joy in his family; feels that these things are hot for him.
His business is prosperous, yet he feels as if he were going to the poor house. No joy or realization of benefit . Extremely irritable, wants to be alone. Does not want to be washed.
Full of anxiety, even of suicide. Despair of recovery his sick. Though there is no eruption at night he is driven to despair by the continual itching. If he throws the covers off then he becomes chilly; if he covers
up, then there is itching.
Sensitive to cold yet the skin is worse from heat. Tingling, itching, formication, crawling like ants running over the surface, as of insects in the skin.
Especially suited to broken down individuals, who have vertigo as soon as they go into the open air; become dizzy and want to go home. and lie down; afraid they will lose their breath.
Head: Old chronic periodical headaches with hunger, and often the hunger lasts during the whole headache; must get up at night for have something to eat.
The headache is sometimes improve by eating. If he goes without a meal he has a headache.
Violent rush of blood to the head, hot face, hair wet with the perspiration, hunger. Every one, two, or three weeks a recurrent headache. Every time the air blows on his head it slacks up the catarrh and a headache comes on.
Either coryza or headache from catching cold. Headache is violent, throbbing, pecking as of little hammer, red face, hot head-congestive at times sweat. Hungry headache in such as have a dry cough in winter. Dry, teasing, racking cough with no expectoration. If the cough ceases he has a periodic headache. So complaints alternate. Head ache goes and cough appears or eruption in winter alternating with headache.
Scalp cold; wears fur cap in summer; worse uncovering the head (Sil.), worse front getting the hair cut (Bell., Glon., Sep.). Hepar is also worse from cold.
Salt rheum, psoriasis in winter. Dry, cold weather, cold wet weather; washing in cold water; dish washing, aggravate the salt rheum.
"Hair dry, lusterless, tangles easily, glues together; must comb it continually."
Ears: Chronic offensive otorrheoa; thick, purulent, offensive, yellow discharge from the ears; smells like stinking meat; continuous discharge; eruptions about and behind ears. Discharge resulting from scarlet fever; abscess in middle ear; otitis media; rupture of drum; prolonged discharge from such all abscess; foetid discharge.
"Otorrheoa with headache; thin, ichorous and horribly offensive like spoiled meat; very offensive, purulent; brown, offensive from left ear, for almost four year."
Otorrheoa associated with watery, offensive diarrhea. Scurfs in ears, and humid scurfs behind cars.
Teeth and mouth: Rigg's disease; the teeth become loose; the gums settle away, spongy, bleed easily, humid, blue, the teeth fall out.
Ulcers about the tongue and mouth; ulcers as found in infancy; aphthae, thrush; ulcerated sore mouth, sore throat, chronic ulcers of throat. Chronic thickening and elongation of the uvula.
Enlargement of tonsils, parotids and submaxillary glands; they become hard and tender to touch; swelling from taking cold. Glands of the neck sore.
Abdomen: Chronic abdominal affections with disturbances of stool. He will strain to pass a soft stool (Nux moshata., Alumina).
Chronic diarrhea; horribly offensive; frequent stool day and night (unlike Sulphur, the remedy it most resembles). He must go several times to pass a normal stool.
Chronic vomiting; ulcer of the stomach, distension of stomach are commonly associated. Always sour belching, sour stomach. Vomiting of blood and bloody stools. This is not strange, because Psorinum has a tendency to hemorrhages, especially from the uterus.
Women: All sorts of menstrual disorders, especially a prolonged menstruation. When a woman has passed through an abortion and the placenta has come away, but every few days a little gush of fresh, bright red
blood and clots, or going days and weeks with a little oozing of bright red blood; every time she gets on her feet there is a new start of the flow; no tendency to permanent recovery.
Two remedies that fit this state are Sulphur and Psorinum. A marked state of relaxation, sub-involution. The uterus does not go back to its normal size and there is this tendency to bleed; a state of inertia.
Soft stool, passed with difficult do not forget this. Obstinate constipation. Haemorrhage from the rectum.
Cholera infantum; often in the early days the stool is horribly offensive, slimy, undigested; there is vomiting and prolonged weakness and the whole child has an offensive odor; child dirty; nose sunken in (Ant. t.), sunken, countenance. Psorinum causes reaction and cures, or brings the child into such a condition that a simple remedy completes the cure.
It is not the sourness of Hepar; in spite of washing, the child smells so sour; like sour milk; the diaper, urine, and faeces and perspiration are sour. This is a strong general feature of Hepar. The stool smells like spoiled eggs, so also the eructations and flatus. The offensiveness of the stool is horrible, but not so permeating as Bapt., which is thick and clay-like, while the Psorinum stool is watery, brown, gushing and may be bloody.
Chronic diarrhea, early morning, urgent. Hot flatus, burning the anus; smells of spoiled eggs, Arn. and Staph. Involuntary stool at night (China has a black, profuse, watery stool at night and after meals.)
In Psorinum, we find the haste of sulphur, the flatulence of Olean. and Aloe, and difficulty of expelling a soft stool like Alumina, China and Nux mosch.
Men: There is prostration in some Psorinum cases; prostration of the genitals.
It is not such an unusual thing in the female to have aversion to sexual intercourse, but man is not often subject to the complaints that cause aversion to coition. Yet we have in man as well as in the woman actual aversion or a state of no enjoyment. He can perform the act and he has no difficulty in obtaining an erection, so it is not impotence, but there is no enjoyment. Impotence comes later.
"Absence of erections; parts flabby, torpid." "Aversion to coition; impotence; want of emission during coitus." "Prostatic fluid discharged before urinating.”
Old gleet, painless discharge; the "last drop;” relaxed and cold genitals; a drop of white or yellow pus after a well selected remedy. (Sepia, Sulphur, Alumina, Psorinum.) Psorinum is indicated above all others if there is an unusually offensive state of the genitals, Thuya, if the odor is of a nauseating, sweet character; warts exposed by rolling back the foreskin; sweet odor in spite of washing.
Heart: Psorinum cures many heart complaints.
Palpitation from the least exertion, better lying. Stitching pain better lying. Cardiac murmurs of either side. Mitral regurgitant murmur. Pericarditis of rheumatic origin. Heart symptoms with general weakness, dusky face, dazed look.
Weak, irregular and rapid pulse. But mark the modalities. Aggravation in the open air, aggravation when sitting up, aggravation when sitting at the writing table; wants to rest the chest and breathing apparatus by
lying down. Asthmatic dyspnoea ameliorated by lying down, and worse the nearer the arms are brought to the body. Such symptoms are found in very few remedies and in none so marked as in Psorinum.
Febrile state. Intermittent, bilious fever, fever from a cold. The patient is so hot that the hand under the covers feels as though in a steam bath and the sensation of heat causes one to draw it back.
It is not the dry heat of Belladonna, yet it is as intense. It is a steam. He is covered with a boiling sweat in fevers. Head and body hot and hot air or steam beneath the covers. (Opium has this, but it is in a violent congestion to the head, an apoplectic condition.) In intermit tents he is taken on the street with difficult breathing. He wants to go home; he is weak and exhausted, crawls up stairs on the hands and knees.
The chill is not marked, but the heat is intense and the sweat copious. He is almost in a stupor, befogged, bewildered, cannot answer questions; face red, puffed, mottled.
"Sweat profuse, cold, clammy from least exertion."
This is another form which comes on in the weak, broken down state. After typhoids, he sweats if he turns in bed, after the least exertion, and the sweat is cold. Profuse night sweats. Night sweats of phthisis; when there is that tremendous heat under the covers, a copious hot sweat; mental state as if dazed.
Marasmus; shriveling of the skin; dirty skin; cannot wash it clean. Offensive discharge from the bowels; great emaciation; increased growth of hair on the face; a fuzz (Nat-mur., Psor., Sulph Calc.); horribly offensive in spite of washing; ravenous appetite yet grows thin. Foetid odors would lead one to think of Psorinum.
Pulsatilla
It is said to be a very good medicine for women, for blondes, especially for tearful blondes. Mind: It is one of the polychrests and one of the medicines most frequently used, as well as often abused. The Pulsatilla patient is an interesting one, found in any household where there are plenty of young girls.
She is tearful, plethoric, and generally has little credit for being sick from her appearances; yet she is most nervous, fidgety, changeable, easily led and easily persuaded. While she is mild, gentle and tearful, yet she is remarkably irritable, not in the sense of pugnacity, but easily irritated, extremely touchy, always feels slighted or fears she will be slighted; sensible to every social influence.
Melancholia, sadness, weeping, despair, religious despair, fanatical; full of notions and whims; imaginative; extremely excitable. She imagines the company of the opposite sex a dangerous thing to cultivate, and that it is dangerous to do certain things well established in society as good for the human race.
These imaginations belong to eating as well as thinking. They imagine that milk is not good to drink, so they will not take it. They imagine that certain articles of diet are not good for the human race. Aversion to marriage is a strong symptom. A man takes it into his head that it is an evil thing to have sexual intercourse with his wife and abstains from it.
Religious freaks; an especial tendency to dwell on religious notions; fixed ideas concerning the Scripture; he misuses and misapplies the Scriptures to his own detriment; dwells on sanctification until he becomes fanatical and insane; thinks he is in a wonderfully sanctification state of mind, or that he has sinned away his day of grace.
This goes no until he becomes insane on other subjects, and then the tendency is to sit day after day ina taciturn way. He will not answer questions unless hard pressed, when all he will say is "Yes" or "No," or be will merely shake his head. Puerperal insanity in a woman who was mild, gentle and tearful, later sad and taciturn, and then she sits in her chair all day answering nothing or merely nodding her head for "Yes" or "No."
Many of the complaints are associated with weakness of the stomach and indigestion, or with menstrual disorders. Women who abort; various irregularities of the menstrual flow; false conception. The mental symptoms are often associated with the ovarian and uterine difficulties.
With such a mental state the general state of the body is worse in a warm room and, relieved by motion. Tearful, sad and despondent, ameliorated walking in the open air, especially when it is crisp, cool, fresh and bright.
Suffocation and an increase of the pains, and even chilliness in a warm room; a nervous chilliness when the patient perspires from the heat of a room. The inflammatory symptoms, neuralgias and rheumatisms are relieved by a cold, by eating and drinking cold things, by cold applications, or cold hands. Cold drinks relieve, even though the patient is not thirsty. Cold foods are digested while hot food make the body warm from which symptoms are worse. Ice cold water feels good going down the oesophagus, and is retained in the stomach, though there is not thirst.
Modalities: Many symptoms worse after eating. It is often only a lump in the stomach, but the mental and nervous symptoms also are worse after eating. The stomach symptoms are worse in the morning, the mental symptoms worse in the evening. Aggravation from fats and rich foods.
Complaints brought ort by eating fat, pork, greasy things. cakes, pastries and rich things. The Pulsatilla stomach is slow to digest. Hours after eating there is a sense of fullness in the stomach, a lump in the stomach, ameliorated by slow walking in the open air.
The patient is commonly relieved from slow motion in the open air, becomes frantic when trying to keep still, worse during rest, ameliorated by doing something, generally slow, moderate motion. This relief from motion and aggravation from rest, relief in the open air, and aggravation in a warm room give us a good summary of this beautiful remedy.
In Pulsatilla patients the skin feels feverish and hot, while the temperature of the body is normal, There is aggravation from much clothing; she wants to wear a thin dress even in moderately cold weather. Does not need to dress warmly. Much clothing and covering aggravate. Often be cannot wear flannels or woolen clothing because they irritate the skin, causing itching and eruptions like Sulphur, and this is not surprising, as Pulsatilla and Sulphur are antidotes.
There is no remedy like Pulsatilla to antidote Sulphur when it has been used every Spring to "cleanse the blood."
Some people use Sulphur until the skin becomes red, hot, easily irritated, and aggravated by clothing. Pulsatilla is the antidote. Old cases of psoriasis; little flat, brownish patches about the size of the thumb nail, which itch tremendously, in old Sulphur patients are cured by Pulsatilla.
A general feature of the skin is itching and burning, but a more marked Pulsatilla state is a Lachesis appearance of the skin. It is mottled, erysipelatous; spotted, purplish in spots; veins engorged; capillaries tumid; a vasomotor paralysis of the capillaries or veins producing a mottled appearance. Pulsatilla has an unusually venous constitution.
Veins: The veins are engorged, in a state of stasis, hence there is over-heat of the skin. This unusual fullness, redness and purple aspect of the face is a false plethora. it often goes on to a puffiness and swelling, and especially at the menstrual periods. Considerable bloating of the face and eyes, bloating of the abdomen; feet puffed so that she cannot wear shoes, feet red and swollen at the menstrual period, ameliorated by the menstrual flow.
Many women are late and are preparing for a week or ten days; face purple, red, puffed and bloated; abdomen distended; dyspnoea; and all this is relieved by the menstrual flow. She feels these symptoms perhaps one or two weeks, and is relieved by slow motion in the open air. Cannot breathe in a warm room; wants the windows open; chokes and suffocates in a warm bed at night. This increases until the menstrual flow starts. The stomach is so full and distended that she cannot eat. No appetite or desire for food.
With the engorgement of veins ulcers surrounded by varicose veins are common in this remedy. Ulcers bleed black blood which coagulates early; little black clots; bleeding is not copious; clots easily, dark, tarry, offensive. Ulcers bleed and ooze, discharge a bloody watery fluid or there is a very thick yellow or green flow.
This brings us to the catarrhal state. Wherever there is mucous membrane there is catarrh. The mucous membrane is covered with purple spots, dry spots; tumid, puffed, looks erysipelatous. Wherever there is inflammation of the mucous membrane it looks purple; a venous congestion.
Thick, green, yellow catarrhal discharges are most characteristic. The catarrhal discharges are bland with the exception of that from the vagina, which is excoriating, causing rawness of the parts. From the eyes, ears, nose and chest there arc thick, yellow, green, bland, discharges, but there is thick yellow green excoriating leucorrhoea. Remember, however, that Pulsatilla has a bland leucorrhoea, in keeping with the general state. Discharges are often offensive, sometimes bloody, watery, but even then mingled with yellow green purulent fluid.
Eyes: The Pulsatilla patient suffers from vertigo from affections of the eyes, ameliorated by wearing well- adjusted glasses; attended by nausea which is worse lying down, worse from motion, worse from the motion of the eyes, and ameliorated in a cold room, and by riding in a carriage in the cold air. As soon as she enters a room that is warm she has nausea, even to vomiting. Vertigo with vomiting after eating.
Head: Pulsatilla has violent headaches. Headaches in school girls who are about to menstruate. Headache accompanying menstruation. Headache associated with suppressed menses, with menstrual disorders; not caused from them, but associated with them.
Pains through the temples and sides of the head are common Pulsatilla headaches. Headaches before, during and after menstruation; but more commonly before, when there is a general state of congestion, stasis, and tumefaction of the veins, and amelioration of the headache when the menses set in if the flow is normal.
It is common to have the head and nervous symptoms through the menses, because the flow is so scanty, often little more than a leucorrhoea, and for a single day a little clot of dark blood.
One-sided headaches and one-sided complaints are peculiar to Pulsatilla. Perspiration on one side of head and face; fever on one side of the body; one side cool and normal and the other side hot. I remember a case of puerperal fever with sweat on one side of the body and dry heat on the other and confusion of other symptoms. Pulsatilla was given and the patient recovered.
The Pulsatilla headache is a throbbing congestive headache; much, heat in the head, ameliorated by the application of cold, by external pressure, and sometimes by slow motion, aggravated by lying and sitting quiet, ameliorated by walking slowly in the air; becomes worse towards evening and gradually increases through the evening and night, worse from the motion of the eyes and from stooping. The pains are often constricting, throbbing and congestive. Periodic sick headaches, with vomiting of sour food. Headache when be overeats. Though he likes ice cream, he has headache and congestion of the stomach after eating ice cream.
Eyes. Catarrhal symptoms. Pustules about the lids and over the ball; on the cornea. Inflammatory features. Thick, yellow-green pus. Granular lids. Continued formation of little pustules. Isolated granules on lids, grow out here and therein bunches as large as pin leads. Eyelids inflamed and bleed easily. Every time he catches cold it settles in the eyes and nose.
Eyes red, inflamed, and discharge, In infants catarrhal diseases of the eyes of a gonorrheal character; ophthalmia neonatorum. In early days the infant often needs the same constitutional remedy as the mother. Yellow green discharge from the eyes; eyes are ameliorated by washing in warm water, or tepid water; even cold water feels good to the eyes.
The Sulphur patient is made worse by bathing; the eyes smart, burn and become increasingly red after washing in water. Pulsatilla causes a tendency to the formation of styes; recurrent styes; always having styes. Pustules, papules and little nodosities on the lids.
Prior to menstruation, in young girls especially, things get black, before the eyes, like a gauze or a veil. Nervous manifestations, twitchings, spell of blindness and fainting. In the early stages of paralysis of the optic nerve Pulsatilla is a great remedy. The patient is always rubbing the eyes; whether or not there is mucus in the eyes it matters not; but it is a sensation of gauze before the eyes, ameliorated by rubbing.
Pulsatilla has cured incipient cataract. Itching of the eyes, in keeping with the skin symptoms. Itching in the ears, nose, tickling in the throat, in the larynx.
Ears: In the ears we have the same catarrhal condition.
Thick, yellow, offensive, purulent, bland discharge; very foetid, sometimes bloody. Pulsatilla is commonly indicated in earache of children; when the child, is a gentle, fat, plump, vascular red-faced child always pitifully crying. If it is a case of earache in a nondescript child Pulsatilla will also prove to be a temporary remedy, so closely is it related to pain in the ear. Pains in the ears in the evening or in the night, ameliorated by walking slowly about the room.
In Chamomilla you have a snap. ping and snarling child, never pleased, scolds the nurse and mother ameliorated by walking about. The irritability decides for Chamomilla. You can detect a pitiful cry from a snarling mad cry. Both are ameliorated by motion, by being carried. Both want this and that and are never satisfied; they want amusement. But the Pulsatilla child when not amused has a pitiful cry and the Chamomilla child a snarling cry. You will want to caress the one and spank the other.
Ear troubles with a ruptured drum and no healing; otitis media. Abscess in the middle ear; inflammation of the middle ear; copious thick bloody discharge, then yellow-green. The case goes on night and day until
rupture takes place. I have found this condition as an endemic, in which Merc., Hep.., and Puls. were the most frequently indicated remedies.
Ear troubles following eruptive diseases. Offensive catarrhal discharge dating back to scarlet fever or measles; badly treated and drugged patients. Inflammation and swelling of the external ear; erysipelatous purple conditions. Scabs on the tragus.
Nose: The patient is subject to repeated attacks of coryza, with sneezing and stuffing up of the nose; a febrile state; sometimes with chills, fever and sweat.
Pains in the face through the nose. In the evening considerable watery discharge with sneezing; in the morning stuffing up of the nose with thick yellow-green discharge. Pulsatilla is suitable to chronic catarrhs, with thick yellow-green discharge which is bland; stuffing up of the nose; copious discharge; patient has a bad smell in the nose; smells various offensive things, sometimes like manure, but more commonly described as the offensiveness of a stinking catarrh.
Large bloody, thick, yellow crusts accumulate in the nose, harden down and are blown out in the morning, accompanied by thick yellow pus. In old lingering cases, loss of smell and taste. The mucous membrane is in a state of thickening and suppuration, with the formation of crusts and ulcers. Fullness high in the nose; stuffing up and fullness in the posterior nares. Hawks up thick yellow mucus in masses, with crusts in the morning, very often offensive to others.
Many Pulsatilla patients in this catarrhal state get relief from this horrible stench by blowing out great crusts. Thick clinkers of dried up pus or dried mucus and pus accumulate for several days and this terrible catarrhal smell comes on; but as soon as he blows out these clinkers the odor goes away and he has relief until they form again in a few days.
The patient himself feels better in the open air, and worse in a warm room. He breathes better in the open air; feels stuffy in a warm room. But there are times when his nose stuffs up more in a warm room, where he sneezes more in a warm room,
The loss of smell is present in chronic and acute catarrhs. Much stuffing up of the nose occurring in the evening; he blows the nose easily and cleans it out during the day, but it stuffs up in the evening and he cannot clear it out.
Remember that the mental symptoms are worse in the evening. He gets up in the morning with a stuffed up nose, but can clean it out; his mouth is foul, tongue coated, rancid taste, requires much brushing of his teeth and washing out of his mouth before he can take his breakfast.
So you see the mouth and stomach symptoms are worse in the morning, the mental symptoms are worse in the evening and there is also a stuffing up of the nose in the evening. Compare this with the cough. There is a dry evening cough in Pulsatilla and a loose morning cough.
Copious expectoration in the morning, but a dry, tight, constricted feeling in the chest in the evening. Stuffed up in the evening, making breathing difficult. To repeat, then, Pulsatilla is one of our sheet anchors in old catarrhs with loss of smell, thick yellow discharge, and amelioration in the open air; in the nervous, timid, yielding, with stuffing up of the nose at night and copious flow in the morning.
With the catarrhs and acute colds there is often bleeding of the nose, blowing blood from the nose; the crusts cling tight, and when blown out they are torn loose, and this causes bleeding; but the nose bleeds
easily, subject to epistaxis. Nose-bleed during the menstrual period; nose-bleed before the menstrual period; nose-bleed with suppressed menses; bleeding dark, thick, clotted, almost black, venous blood.
Especially do we find catarrhal subjects in women who have late, scanty, light colored menses; scarcely more than a leucorrhoea; if bloody, then only a little black stain or clot. Chlorotic patients who have their menses once every two or three months; chlorotic girls who are irregular, and are subject to these catarrhal states.
Pulsatilla is very useful in hay fever. The management of hay fever requires considerable study because you have to deal with the troublesome imaginations of the patient, he will refuse to let you study him; he wants the hay fever treated; he don't want the hemorrhoids, the thick skin on the soles of the feet, the pains in the sacrum, the diarrhea which alternates with constipation, talked about or inquired into; these are always better when the hay fever is present.
Sometimes he will tell you that he is always well except when he has hay fever. He may feel well, but it is impossible for him to be well; he has always had these complaints and he does not want you to bother with them. The hay fever will hardly ever reveal the indications for a remedy for the patient.
Another individual has epilepsy, and if you expect to find in the fit the remedy that cures the patient you will be mistaken. When an acute mimicking manifestation of disease follows several times the same beaten track the details are hard to find. He does not know much about his hay fever. If you suggest several things he has them all. In nearly all these acute expressions you do not find in the exaggerated attack the symptoms that will lead you to the remedy.
You will find these symptoms by getting the state of the patient before he was taken with bay fever. These primitive symptoms are of more importance. Sometimes it is important to know what region was affected before the nose was affected. At times you will find spinal symptoms; great soreness in the back relieved by lying on something hard. Few remedies have that. They do not tell you that at first but continue to dwell on the bay fever. In many nervous women the attack comes on with sneezing and watery discharge and then a copious, thick, yellowish-green discharge. These are the natural symptoms of hay fever, but in the "back" symptoms you see something.
In Pulsatilla the menstrual symptoms and the prolapsus come in. When the hay fever comes on, all the other symptoms are better, she feels nothing except the hay fever, however, all the symptoms interweave with each other.
The Natrum mur. symptoms will be worse in the morning and until toward noon, while in Pulsatilla they are worse in the evening, the nose filling up with thick, yellowish-green, ropy mucus, and when the nose has been cleared, a dry, burning, smarting feeling remains; if the room is warm at night, she cannot sleep.
Natrum mur. is a little like that in the smarting and inability to sleep at night in a warm room. In Natrum mur. too, the discharge may continue day and night. We have an acute class in which Pulsatilla is sometimes indicated-copious watery discharge which ends in sneezing. In the beginning we will think of Carbo veg., Arsenic, Allium cepa, Euphrasia.
With Carbo veg. there is a watery discharge and the irritation extends into the chest, with hoarseness and rawness. In Allium cepa we have one group of symptoms that points to this remedy. Excoriating discharge from the nose and bland discharge from the eyes; in the larynx, sensation as if hooks were there, and sometimes this extends below the larynx; this always means Allium cepa; it is also worse in a warm room like Puls.
The Euphrasia looks like Cepa, only the discharge from the eyes is copious, watery and burning the lachrymation burns the eyes and excoriates the cheeks; discharge from nose is bland like Pulsatilla; sometimes this goes into the chest, then it is no longer Euphrasia.
Iodine is worse in a warm room; thick discharge from nose which bums and excoriates and is yellowish- green; but there is one thing that differentiates it from all the others -the patient immediately begins to emaciate when the complaint comes on and is very hungry.
Kali hydr. with the thick yellowish discharge, worse in a warm room, there is a great amount of rawness and burning in the nose; external nose very sore to pressure; sensitiveness in the root of the nose; whole face aches and patient is extremely restless; wants to walk in the open air which does not fatigue him.
Iodide of Arsenic; anxiety, restlessness and weakness; frequent sneezing and copious watery nasal discharge that burns the lip. Burning, watery discharge from the eyes like Arsenic. Arsenic wants to be very warm; wants hot water applied to the eyes; the only relief is from sniffing hot water up the nose. The Iodide of Arsenic is worse in a warm room, and, for days after sneezing, the discharge thickens and becomes gluey, looking like thick yellow honey, this excoriates; much pain through the root of the nose and eyes; often rawness in the chest with dyspnoea.
The remedies having the dyspnoea are Arsenic, Iodide of Arsenic, Iodine, Kali hydr., and Sabadilla; these are the ones I have found most frequently indicated in the asthmatic forms of hay fever. If the complaint has been developed after being overheated about that time, you will find that Silica, Puls. and Carbo veg. must be carefully compared.
There is another class of remedies having the stuffing up of the nose not relieved by the discharge. There is a constant duke to blow the nose, yet he gets no relief. This makes me think at once of Lach., Kali bi., Psor., Naja and Sticta.
Psorinum has the copious, watery, bland discharge from the nose, it may be excoriating, it has both. The stuffing up of the nose generally takes place in the open air; he is relieved in a warm, close room, and by lying down; has sonic dyspnoea. which is relieved by stretching the arms at right angles with the body. Hay fever is a psoric sickness. Psorinum given ina single dose will so develop the symptoms that the case will be more clear. The attack is not the best thing to prescribe for. If it is too violent, a short acting remedy may be selected that will mitigate it.
Nux vomnica has a free easy breathing in the open air, but when he goes into the warm room his nose stuffs up, which also occurs at night, though the water drips on the pillow yet he stuffs up like Puls., Bry., and the Iodine preparations Iodide of Arsenic and Cyclamen. Do not understand me to have given remedies for hay fever, we cannot lay down remedies for diseases. The whole constitution must be most carefully examined.
Face: The face is sickly, often mottled, purple, intermixed with yellow and unhealthy colors; venous puffing; sensation of fullness; often a red face, like that of health, and the patient gets no sympathy; face often flushes; flushes of heat to the face; at times a sunken look; dark rings about the eyes; sallow, green, chlorotic.
Subject to erysipelas; erysipelatous blotches on the face, spreading to the scalp, with stinging and burning; skin of face very sensitive to touch at such times.
Mumps and inflammation of parotid glands. If a woman suffering with mumps takes a decided cold the breasts swell, and there is an inflammation of the mammary gland. Girls take cold, the swelling of the
parotid subsides too soon, and the corresponding mammary gland swells; sometimes both swell; or it may begin in one and go to the other.
In men it is the testicle. Pulsatilla is one of the most important remedies in this form of metastasis; it breaks up complaints that flit about. Pulsatilla is the common remedy for enormously swollen testicles from mumps in a boy. Carbo vegetabilis is another remedy, but then you have a Carbo veg. patient. Abrotanum is also useful in wandering around symptoms.
Pains: Pulsatilla has wandering pains, rheumatism goes from joint to joint, jumps around here and there; neuralgic pains fly from place to place; inflammations go from gland to gland.
But here is the distinguishing feature - Pulsatilla sticks to its own text; it keeps jumping around, but it does not change to a new class of disease. Abrotanum has this metastasis, but it changes the whole diagnosis; that is, the allopath says,
"This is a new disease today."
The patient has a violent diarrhoea today, and an ignoramus suppresses it; an inflammatory rheumatism comes on, and he calls it a new disease. The suppression of a diarrhoea or a hemorrhage, or the removal of piles, causes an out-cropping somewhere else. A child has a summer complaint suppressed and there follow symptoms referring to the brain, kidneys, liver, or a marasmus with emaciation from. below upwards. Such things are in the nature of Abrotanum.
Stomach: Hours after eating the patient eructates mouthfuls of sour, rancid, bitter fluid; liquids roll up from the stomach; always belching up rancid food.
Some patients cannot digest butter; cannot use olive oil on their food. All sorts of bad tastes in the mouth. Several hours after eating has not finished digesting food in the stomach. Sour vomiting and eructations.
Digestion is slow, and the patient goes to the next meal hungry; eating does not satisfy; assimilation is bad. Always bilious. Mouth is slimy and the taste is bad. All these symptoms are worse in the morning.
"Accumulation of saliva and much mucus in the mouth." "Flow of sweetish or tenacious saliva." "Constant spitting of frothy, cotton-like mucus."
A striking feature of the Pulsatilla patient is that he never wants water. Dryness of the mouth, but seldom thirsty. Even in -many of the fevers he is thirstless, but there is at times an exception to this in high fevers there may be some thirst.
"Thirstlessness, with moist or dry tongue. Desire for sour, refreshing things."
Often desires things he cannot digest; lemonade, herring, cheese, pungent things, highly-seasoned things, juicy things.
"Aversion to meat, butter, fat food, pork, bread, milk, smoking."
"Scraping sensation in stomach and oesophagus like heartburn."
Many pains in the stomach when empty or when full. But the bloating, the gas and the sour stomach are most striking. Gastric catarrh. Craves ice cream; craves pastries, yet they will not digest, and make him worse. Craves things which make him sick. This is not uncommon. The whisky drinker craves his liquor, yet knows it will kill him. So in Pulsatilla with regard to pastries. Craves batter cakes, with maple syrup, yet knows they will be vomited. Craves highly spiced sausage, yet averse to pork alone.
Pulsatilla produces and cures jaundice.
"Jaundice in consequence of chronic susceptibility to hepatitis and derangement of secretion of bile, with looseness of bowels duodenal catarrh; disordered digestion feverishness and thirstlessness after quinine."
Abdomen: Many troubles seem to manifest themselves in the abdomen by bloating, distension of the abdomen, flatulence, colicky pains, rumbling, fermentation of food, and from disorders of menstruation or diarrhea.
Great sensitiveness, tumefaction, tenderness; whole abdomen, stomach and pelvic organs sensitive to touch. Bloating after eating, especially after fats and rich foods. Fullness of the veins; general venous stasis. It brings about especially a tumid fullness of the abdomen, such a stuffed feeling that she cannot breathe.
Women: Ina woman about to menstruate, there is bloating of the abdomen, stuffed feeling, has to throw
off her clothes, cannot wear stays, wants to get into a loose dress or, to go to bed - so extremely puffed is she.
Associated with this abdominal tumefaction the face and lips become bloated and puffed, the eyes red, and the feet puffed so that she cannot wear her shoes. There is also a sensation of dragging down, a sense of great weakness, commonly related to the menstrual disturbances or uterine disorders.
The dragging down is recognized as prolapsus uteri. It is felt in the whole abdomen and is described as a funneling sensation, as if the parts would push out into the world, a dragging down. Oversensitiveness (of the abdomen; especially in the lower part of the abdomen. She cannot stand on her feet or walk around much, because of the weight and dragging down.
Labor-like pains in the uterus and back as if the menses would come on. It is not uncommon for the Pulsatilla patient to feel through the whole month as if she were about to menstruate.
The abdominal and bowel symptoms are associated.
Cutting, flitting changing pains. Pains urging to stool. Griping, in the bowels associated with dysentery or diarrhoea; loose watery or green stools. A striking feature of the bowel symptoms is a loose, watery, green stool, continually changing; yellow, faecal, slimy.
In summer complaints, when Pulsatilla is the indicated remedy, there will be hardly two stools alike; continually changing. This is characteristic of Pulsatilla in general; the pains wander; complaints change by metastases; the patient is scarcely ever twice alike. Diarrhea alternating with constipation. Menstrual flow stops and starts, intermits and changes. In the Pulsatilla patient you never know what you will find next.
Dysentery; dysenteric stools; scanty, slimy, bloody, green, watery stool with a little spurt; next stool might be diarrheic, with quite a copious discharge; thus you have diarrhoea and dysentery together.
Troublesome chronic constipation; stool large, hard and difficult to expel. It has (like Nux) frequent urging to stool without any, stool, or frequent urging with only a scanty stool; goes many times before can pass a stool, Nux and Pulsatilla.
Frequent unsuccessful urging in a chronic case is looked on as a keynote to Nux, but many remedies have it. Pulsatilla is one. The diarrhoea and bowel symptoms of Pulsatilla are worse, in the evening and during the night; that is, the stools are worse at night. The stomach, throat and mouth symptoms are worse in the morning. The mental symptoms are worse in the evening. The bowel and stool symptoms are aggravated by keeping perfectly still, and ameliorated by gentle motion.
There is much restlessness in Pulsatilla. Amelioration from motion in the cool open air. Feels stuffed up in a close room, and wants the windows open.
"Dysenteric stools of clear yellow, red or green slime; pain in the back, straining." "Stools of deep green mucus; pain in the abdomen; no thirst." You will remember the word green in Pulsatilla, as it relates extensively to the catarrhal discharges.
Most troublesome constipation with hemorrhoids; violent pains in the hemorrhoids, worse lying down, ameliorated from gentle motion, worse from the warmth of the bed, better moving about in the open air.
She becomes so nervous in a room while at rest that the pains seem intensified and she must move about. Hemorrhoids: "Hemorrhoids; painful protruding, blind, with itching and stitches in anus."
The aggravation from lying down in extremely painful hemorrhoids is contrasted with Ammonium carb. which has violently painful hemorrhoids relieved by lying flat on the back. In violently painful hemorrhoids, with intense burning, think of Arsenicum and Kali Carbonicum.
In those with sticking, tearing pains study Aesculus.
Looking over a number of years I have been forced to use in this cases a remedy not yet fully proven. In painful hemorrhoids, in a broken down constitution where the whole disease seems to culminate in the hemorrhoids; bleeding, protruding; a mere touch almost causes a convulsion; it causes her to scream out at the top of her voice; it is so painful that she feels that death would be a relief; she lies in bed, holding the nates far apart with her hands; after every stool she has three or four hours of extreme suffering. In these case look up the Paeony.
The hemorrhoids it cures look like the flowers of the plant, they are so inflamed, so red and bleeding; oozing; tender to touch; patient is so worn out with the pain. It has many times relieved the pain and cured these enormous hoemorrhoidal tumors. I have cured them after they. Had been operated on, and all sorts of violence done them, without relief. Do not go to this drug if you can find a remedy that covers all the patient. Many patients will not confess any other symptoms, and some of these will suffer so much from the hemorrhoids alone that you will really need this remedy.
Urine: frequent, scanty, with urging; wonderful tenesmus; extremely painful, bloody, burning, smarting urine; there is scarcely a drop collects in the bladder but it must be expelled.
She cannot lie on the back without having a desire to urinate. She may go all night without urinating if she does not lie on the back, but the minute she turns on her back she is wakened by the desire to urinate and she feels that if she does not hurry she will pass it involuntarily.
Involuntary urination when coughing and sneezing, or from a sudden shock or surprise, or from sudden joy, or from laughing, or from the noise of the slam of a door or a pistol shot. Pulsatilla has dribbling of urine, dribbles on the slightest provocation.
She must keep her mind. Continually on it, or she will lose her urine. As soon as she goes to sleep it flows away. Little, mild, gentle, florid, plethoric, warm-blooded girls, who kick the covers off at night and have nocturnal enuresis.
Yellow, sallow, sickly girls who lose their urine in their first sleep call for Sepia. Losing the urine in the first sleep is looked upon as a strong symptom, but you can figure it out, and hence it is not so. All those cases that have to make an effort to hold the urine during the day lose in their first sleep; for then the mind is taken off it, and as soon as the mind is taken off it the urine dribbles.
Causticum and Sepia are remedies looked upon as curing involuntary urination during the first sleep, but I have cured it with many other remedies.
A man past middle age flooded the bed at night as soon as he went to sleep. The medicines which have this are limited and be had received them all. I found I must figure it out on another basis. I ascertained that when moving about at his work he had no difficulty in holding the urine but when he sat down he had to make an effort to control it. At the time this condition developed he had been in Atlantic City and had bathed much in the ocean. Here were the aggravation and amelioration of Rhus, and Rhus cured him. Few would think of Bryonia in urinary trouble.
When he moves the urine dribbles, when he walks it flows. He is relieved only by keeping quiet. Bryonia is aggravated by motion; Rhus is relieved by motion.
Pulsatilla has relief from motion. A few remedies have relief from slow motion and of these Pulsatilla and Ferrum are the most striking. A few remedies are relieved by hurried motion; want to move fast. Such are Bromine and Arsenicum. The Arsenic child cannot be carried fast enough. The Pulsatilla baby is content with moderate motion. Any motion that heats up the Pulsatilla patient aggravates all the complaints. A wood sawyer working hard said his cough was relieved by moving about but when he became heated up from sawing he had to sit down and rest on account of the violent spasmodic cough that would come on.
Pulsatilla has complaints from exposure to rain; getting feet wet. Urinary troubles, worse when getting chilled (Dulcamara). Pulsatilla establishes a chronic, inveterate catarrh of the bladder. Copious mucous discharge, bloody discharge, especially after taking cold. Thick, ropy, purulent, green, offensive discharge.
Men: Sexual desire unusually strong. "Long lasting morning erection." "Sexual excesses resulting in headache, backache; limbs heavy."
"Burning and aching of the testicles, with or without swelling.”
Orchitis; inflammation and swelling of the testicles from suppressed gonorrhea, from mumps, from catching cold, from, sitting on damp ground, or on a cold stone when perspiring. Gonorrhea suppressed by injections.
"Cold" settles in the testicles. Pulsatilla is the most frequently indicated remedy in gonorrhoea. in which the discharge is thick yellow or thick yellow and green, in those who are sensitive to heat, ameliorated walking in the open air. But also in persons with no other symptoms, and the gonorrheal discharge is thick yellow or green; no symptoms contra-indicating it.
Troublesome lingering discharges; an old gleet rouses into a thick yellow discharge, when be takes cold or after coition. Frequent tenesmus; chordee; urging to urinate; burning urination and yellow discharge.
Tumefaction about the penis. Foreskin dropsical. (Nitric ac., Fluor. ac., Cann. sat.). Pulsatilla is useful in cases of suppressed gonorrhea, with complaints following. Inflammation of the prostate. In old sinners with enlarged prostate, hard, flat, packed faeces, must always use a catheter; especially when the trouble has been brought on by sexual abuses, sexual excesses, vices. Pain in the testicles; tearing in the swollen testicles. Pain along the cord like cutting of knives; lacerating, tearing.
Women: Exaggerated sexual desire; nymphomania; wild, beside herself with sexual thoughts; uncontrollable sexual desire. Inflammation of ovaries and uterus. Suppression of menses from getting feet wet. Menses too late, scanty.
Face pale, yellow, sallow, or green like a chlorotic patient. It overcomes the tendency to miscarriage, false conception, moles, etc., and stops the growth of fibroids, other symptoms agreeing. In pregnancy and during confinement many symptoms call for Pulsatilla.
Most often called for when the patient is not irritable and the pains are very feeble, lasting for several days, and doing nothing; irregular, flitting, changeable pains, now up the back, now down the limbs; a prolonged first stage or prolonged preparatory symptoms. Chamomilla is more suitable if the woman is extremely irritable. But in a mild, gentle, mental state, when the pains are irregular, the os dilated and the contractions have let up, the pains too short, Pulsatilla will terminate that labor in a short time. The next pain after the dose will be a good one. You very often see in these cases that the outside parts are relaxed and the conditions are such that everything ought to go on well, but there is inaction. For weak pains Pulsatilla stands high.
Violent menstrual colic, causing her to bend double; soreness in the region of the uterus and ovaries; distended abdomen; throws the covers off; wants the windows open; tearful; weeps without a cause. Suppression of the menstrual flow from getting feet wet. Flow slow in being established and then scarcely more than a leucorrhea.
Menstruation that has been painful since puberty in plethoric girls. I have seen Pulsatilla cure a great many girls of sixteen to eighteen years old. The mother comes to me saying her daughter has suffered since her first menses; she went in swimming, or got her feet wet, and has suffered since. The doctor says the parts ‘are undeveloped and she must be operated on.
Pulsatilla has established a normal flow in a few months. Now I will give you a contrast in another remedy. Scrawny girls who are sensitive to cold, have also taken a bath at the time the first menses should appear, or have got the feet wet, and the flow is partially suppressed, or has come on with an inflammation; a state of undevelopment is established, a stenosis; horrible menstrual colic; bearing down pains, as if everything would escape into the world, doubling the patient up; ameliorated by heat and aggravated by cold. Calc. phos. is the remedy.
"In girls of mild disposition, when puberty is unduly delayed, or menstrual function is defectively or irregularly performed; they are pale and languid, complain of headache, chilliness and lassitude."
To develop these young girls Pulsatilla is a great remedy. Most troublesome cases of prolapsus. It competes with Sepia, Belladonna, Natrum mur., Nux vomica and Secale; all of these are remedies with great relaxation, bearing down; some have cured even procidentia.
Pulsatilla cures many cases of gonorrhoea in females. I think it is most commonly indicated. A striking feature is, when the menstrual flow is present there is milk in the breasts.
In girls at puberty - milk in the breasts; a premature establishment of milk. In non-pregnant women, milk in the breasts. (Cyclamen and Mercurius.)
Chest: The chest, respiratory organs, and cough furnish some most troublesome symptoms.
Bronchitis; pneumonia. Dry, teasing cough and dyspnoea; wants the windows open, aggravated lying down. Cough gagging and choking. Copious expectoration in the morning, of thick yellow-green mucus. Dry, teasing cough at night, worse lying down, Chronic loose cough after measles. Whooping cough.
In the larynx we have many symptoms; constriction; tickling causing cough. Dry, teasing cough, worse lying and in a warm room. Cough worse at night. Bronchitis with loose morning and dry, evening cough.
Dyspnoea; oppression from walking fast or becoming overheated after eating; stopping up nose; after emotions. Spasmodic contraction of larynx. Tightness of chest; dyspnoea when lying on left edge; suffocation in the evening and during the night.
Asthma of children from suppressed rash or in women from suppressed menses. Loud rattling in the chest when lying. Chronic loose cough after measles. Expectoration of copious, thick, yellow-green, or bloody mucus; salty; offensive. Chronic catarrh of chest. Sensation of fullness in the chest in the evening with pulsation preventing sleep.
Palpitation from lying on the left side. Soreness in the walls of the chest. Pain in the chest sometimes relieved by lying on the opposite side; dryness and rawness in the chest. Wandering tearing pains in the chest; cutting pains in pleurisy; violent beat in the chest.
Haemorrhage of the lungs, dark blood. Dry cough in the evening, loose in the morning. Hemorrhage with suppressed menses or instead of the menses. Pulsatilla is very useful in catarrhal phthisis in chlorotic girls.
Back: In curvature of the spine Puls. is of great value.
Pain in the back, lumbar and sacral regions; wandering pains; spinal irritation after sexual excesses. Rheumatic pains in the spine and limbs, worse during rest and better from slow motion. Pain in small of back as if sprained; sensation of cold water poured down back.
All the limbs are painful; drawing, tearing pains in the limbs, better from motion and after motion; worse from a warm room and better from cold applications. Swelling of the veins in the arms and hands. Varicose veins of the limbs like Fl. ac. Rheumatism of joints; pain in joints as if dislocated. Sciatica worse in the evening and better from slowly moving about. Drawing and tension of muscles in lower limbs in the evening in bed. Tearing, jerking pains in the limbs, changing place. Burning in the veins. Purple swelling
with violent itching of the feet as if they had been frozen. Feet burn, and he must put them out of bed. Soles bum and are bruised when walking.
Marked restlessness and twitching of the limbs and feet; numbness of the limb, lain on; wandering pains in all the limbs.

These features are found in hectic fevers in the last stages of phthisis, as well as septic fevers. It aborts puerperal fever in a few hours when clearly indicated. In cases of typhoid where there is the confusion like - that found in Baptisia and the heat is too intense for that remedy, Pyrogen should always be considered.

there was an abscess of the calf slowly forming. He took Pyrogen and made a rapid and complete recovery. This time the abscess did not open. He has remained in good health now ten years.

Paralysis of the arms; erysipelas with much swelling in the limbs; swelling of the bands and arms.
When grasping anything a tingling and pricking is felt in the hands and fingers; crawling and numbness in the finger tips and fingers; swelling of the fingers; eruptions upon the hands and fingers. In the lower limbs, we find similar pains and similar modalities pain in the hip when lying upon it; tearing, drawing pains in the lower limbs; sciatica with tearing, drawing pains in the lower limbs, worse during rest and ameliorated from motion, brought on from becoming chilled, from cold damp weather, from exposure, and from suppressing the sweat.
In sprains such as occur in the ankles and in fact any of the joints, after Arnica has removed the first and most painful symptoms, Rhus becomes useful for weakness of tendons and muscular fibers such as always follows sprains.
It is a routine remedy for this weakness in joints following sprains. The pains rush in streaks down the limbs; restlessness in the lower limbs at night, but amelioration from motion; must keep the limbs in constant motion; paralysis of the lower limbs, great weariness and heaviness of the lower extremities; weakness of the lower limbs on going up stairs; swelling of the joints of the lower limbs; stiffness of the knees and feet. Paroxysmal pains in the legs from getting wet, especially when sweating; complaints from living in damp houses; rheumatism in the lower limbs from living in damp houses.
Skin: Ulcers on the legs. Intolerable itching of the legs at night in bed; eruptions upon the feet and legs; foetid sweat of the feet in persons of rheumatic tendency,
Eczema of the lower limbs. Rhus is a useful remedy in fevers. In typhoid sufficient has been said. It is a very useful remedy in scarlet fever with coarse rash. When the rash has been suppressed, with inflammation of the glands and much sore throat. During fever there is often violent urticaria which passes off during the sweat; night sweat with much itching eruption; fevers from suppressed foot sweat; rheumatic fevers; fevers
worse at night; fevers that come with cold sores on the lips, remittent fevers and intermittent fevers takes on the typhoid type and run through their course as symptomatic typhoid fever.
Intolerable itching of the skin; tingling in the skin; eruptions burn and itch violently; much moisture with eruptions upon the skin.
Large blisters form upon the skin either with or without erysipelas. The incessant itching is sometimes relieved by "scalding" the parts, as it is called by some who are poisoned with Rhus, by "scalding" with water as hot as it is possible to bathe the parts in. Rhus has cured shingles and the tendency to herpetic eruptions. It has made a grand record with humid eczema such as have raw surfaces; excoriated; oozing much. It is very commonly the remedy for hives that come on from getting wet or hives that come on during rheumatism or during chills and fever; hives that are worse in the cold air.
Rumex Crispus
Rumex, the yellow dock, is a neglected remedy, and one that has been only partially proved.
The mental symptoms have not been brought out, but the catarrhal symptoms have been well expressed by provers.
There is a state of sadness, low spirited; aversion to work; irritable mental excitability. This includes about all the mental state we know of this remedy, as the provings were made with the lower potencies and tincture.
The yellow dock has been used in domestic practice, as a blood medicine, to cure eruptions and boils. When used in this way it is a mild substance, and hence the provings are somewhat in this form.
The catarrhal tendency is very striking. The nose, eyes, chest and trachea, the whole respiratory tract, gives forth a copious flow, copious mucous discharge. I have seen it so copious from the nose that it seemed as one continuous flow; so copious from the trachea and bronchial tubes that the patient continually hawked up, by the mouthful, thin frothy, white mucus, so that in a little while as much as half a pint of thin mucus, as thin as water, would be in the cuspidor. It also has marked dryness of the larynx and trachea with hard, dry, spasmodic cough.
At times it has taken the form of grippe, with a copious mucous discharge; thin, watery, frothy expectoration by the mouthful. This is only the first stage. Following this the discharge becomes thick, yellow, tough or thick, white and tenacious; so ropy and stringy and tough that in spite of blowing the nose and coughing he fails to get it up. Completely exhausted from his efforts to expectorate the tough, stringy, tenacious even gluey mucus. This catarrhal state is commonly accompanied by a morning diarrhea, and these constitute the leading features.
"Catarrhal headache with great irritation of the larynx and trachea, clavicular pain and soreness behind sternum."
Catarrhal headaches are headaches that come on during spells of dryness, alternating with a copious flux. Extreme rawness in the larynx and trachea; burning and smarting; unable to endure pressure on the throat
pit.
Tickling in the throat pit causing cough. Must sit without motion; cannot breathe deeply, hurriedly or irregularly because the burning is so much increased by any change in breathing.
If he steps into the open air a paroxysmal cough takes his breath away; or if he passes from the open air into a warm room the same paroxysmal cough comes on. The paroxysm is so violent that in the morning, when he has a loose stool, he will pass it involuntarily with the cough. The urine also passes away with the cough. The headache returns when the discharges slack up.
A striking feature is pain under the clavicle; a sense of rawness under the clavicle; as if the parts inside were raw; as if the air came directly under the clavicle, producing rawness and burning. Rawness and burning from the inhalation of air.
"Nose obstructed; dry sensation even in posterior nares."
Many times the coryza starts out by a marked dryness in the posterior nares, so that he is constantly hawking; the irritation is so great that he cannot let it alone. There is a sensation of thickening in the nasopharynx, and he produces a peculiar noise in trying to get rid of it.
"Sudden sharp tingling sensation in Schneiderian membrane."
This is intense; tingling, sometimes described as an itching extending from the end of the nose to the pharynx; sometimes forces sneezing, blowing the nose and this peculiar noise, and sometimes a hawking to get the mucus when it isi a little lower in the pharynx; hemming to get rid of it when in the larynx. The inflammation passes to the smallest bronchi, producing a capillary bronchitis and finally a pneumonia.
It suits acute and chronic catarrhal states. In old phthisical cases every time be takes a cold, he is so sensitive to cold air and change of air that he sleeps with the bed clothes over his mouth. Every breath of air causes a spasmodic cough.
The early expectoration is thin mucus, and then it becomes thicker and tenacious, and he cannot expectorate it; he hears the rattle, after many efforts which exhaust him; he expectorates a little with hardly any relief. This is a great remedy to do patch work with in phthisis. Soreness, rawness and burning, especially down the trachea and tinder the sternum.
"Violent sneezing, with fluent coryza, worse in the evening and at night." Many symptoms are worse in the evening. "Coryza, fluent, with sneezing, with headache, worse evening and night."
Some symptoms are worse in the early morning. Certain kinds of cough are worse at 1 P.M. Lachesis and Rumex furnish a puzzle in this cough and each has to be understood.
In Lachesis young children cough in their early sleep, but if kept awake they will not cough. Therefore in Lachesis the 1 P.M. cough is an aggravation from sleep. In Rumex the cough will come on at 11 o'clock whether the child is asleep or not.
"Accumulation of mucus in posterior nares."
"Yellow mucous discharge through posterior nares."
"Epistaxis, violent sneezing and painful irritation of nostrils." "Influenza with violent catarrh, followed by bronchitis."
"Scraping in the throat;" whenever this catarrhal state goes into the larynx and trachea, there is this continual scraping in the throat.
Hoarse; cannot speak because the vocal cords are covered with tough mucus. Chronic cases have often been cured.
Phosphorus has this hoarseness, but especially aphonia relieved by hemming up a little mucus from the vocal cords. The Causticum hoarseness is due to a weakness of the vocal cords. Phosphorus has an inflammatory state and the continual accumulation of mucus impedes speech. Rumex has the accumulation of tough, gelatinous, gluey mucus, and he continually scrapes the larynx.
"Sensation of a lump in the throat, not relieved by hawking or swallowing, it descends on deglutition, but immediately returns’; this is also a strong feature in Lachesis.
"Aching in the pharynx, with collection of tough mucus in the fauces.” "Catarrhal affections of throat and fauces."
This remedy shows the various stages of severe cold, but is especially indicated in constitutions that are constantly taking cold worse from change of the weather; always shivering about the fire want much clothing, want even the head covered up.
Many complaints are worse in the evening, from a bath, from becoming cold, from inhaling cold air. Rheumatic complaints are common and are aggravated by cold. Every cold seems to affect the joints. This is a marked feature of Calcarea phos .; every change to cold is felt in the joints; from bathing and getting
chilled afterwards.
"Tight, suffocative, heavy ache in epigastrium, through to back clothes seem too tight; weak feeling in epigastrium, all aggravated when talking; frequently takes a long breath."
"Shooting from pit of stomach to chest; sharp pain in left chest; slight nausea; dull aching in forehead."
"Aching and shooting in pit of stomach and above it on each side of sternum."
Stomach: The stomach will not digest food, or only the, simplest food; the mucous membrane of the stomach is affected by this remedy like other mucous membranes.
Various pains in the stomach; aching, shooting pains in the pit of the stomach.
"Aching pain in the pit of stomach gradually becoming very severe; sharp stitching pains in stomach extending into chest, and below a sensation of pressure like a lump in pit of stomach, sometimes rising up under sternum, greatly aggravated from motion and somewhat from taking a long breath; generally aggravated after eating, ameliorated by lying perfectly quiet."
It is strange how the stomach symptoms are aggravated by talking.
The stomach feels sore, aggravated by talking, walking, inhaling cold air; wants warm things. Very flatulent; full of flatulent pains; pains relieved (Carbo veg.) by belching and passing flatus. Stomach and abdominal pains aggravated by talking, irregular, breathing; must sit in a chair and breathe with perfect regularity. Irregular breathing will cause cough or suffocation.
In the morning hurried to stool like Sulphur.
"Stools, painless, offensive, profuse; brown or black, thin or watery; preceded by pain in abdomen; before stool sudden urging, driving him out of bed in morning."
"Morning diarrhea with cough from tickling in throat pit." It is common for phthisical cases to have a morning diarrhoea, and many of them look like Sulphur. When the morning diarrhea is gushing, Rumex will palliate; it will allay the extreme sensibility of the lungs, will
ward off the sensitiveness to cold and will patch him up.
Rumex is not so deep as Sulphur, but it is an antipsoric. It is limited however, to the early stages; will carry a chronic case so, far, but it will require to be followed by another antipsoric. Calcarea follows it well.
Rumex is as sensitive to cold, to baths and chilly surroundings as Rhus, but it is aggravated by motion. Bryonia may be confused with it in this aggravation from motion and from talking, but Bryonia is not so sensitive to cold air, is often relieved from cold air and worse in a warm room; the complaints subside if the room becomes cool. In Rumex the nerves are sensitive to the open air; a nervous sensitiveness to open air as marked as Nux.
"Brown, watery diarrhoea, chiefly in morning, having stools from 5 to 9 A.M."
"Serious attack of diarrhea in an old man of seventy, after failure of Sulphur".
The Sulphur patient with a cough, especially in phthisis, commonly wants cool air, cooling things; though the stomach symptoms are sometimes ameliorated from hot drinks, yet he wants cool, refreshing air.
"Aphonia after exposure to cold." "Tenacious mucus in throat or larynx, constant desire. to hawk." "Tickling in throat pit causing cough."
He fights off the cough as long as he can because of the burning and rawness. In the most violent coryza there is a lack of the febrile symptoms of Bryonia, Rhus and Aconite. It has not the constitutional symptoms, the aching of the limbs, the general soreness, the high fever and thirst. The condition seems to have localized itself.
"Hoarse, barking cough, in attacks, every night at 1 P.M. and at 2 and 5 A.M. (children)." "Cough, with pain behind midsternum."
"The most violent cough occurs a few moments after lying down and at night, in some cases, complete aphonia".
"In women, every fit of coughing produces the passage of a few drops of urine."
Rumex is one of the most valuable palliatives in advanced phthisis it will often carry a case through another winter. With Rumex, Pulsatilla, Senega, Arsenic and Nux vomica you can patch up the last years of a phthisical patient.
I would caution you also about the diarrhea that occurs in most cases of phthisis.
You will see Acetic acid recommended for the diarrhoea in phthisis. You had better let such conditions alone, unless they are very marked. If the diarrhea is very exhausting use some simple medicine, like this one, to slack it up. But the phthisical patient is better off with a little diarrhea, a loose morning stool. It is the same with night sweats; if he does not have them he will have something more violent.
The allopath stops the diarrhea and night sweats, and then has to feed Morphine to his patient because of the consequent sufferings. The more you undertake to relieve these outward conditions, these vents, the more harm you will do the patient, and if you go on you will have to abandon your Homoeopathy and give Morphine, which is really a crime.
You will remove the sore, bruised, aching all over the body of a consumptive by Arnica, and it will suit the cough and gagging and retching, and make him sleep.
Later Pyrogen may be needed for the aching in the bones and distressing cough. You patch him up year after year; sometimes Arsenic is the remedy, and it has to be more frequently repeated; sometimes it is Lycopodium, Pulsatilla, Pyrogen or Arnica.
These medicines help him along and they have often to be changed, but finally the break down occurs, and these medicines are no longer suitable. An awful dyspnoea gradually creeps on the patient; there is craving for air; the breathing space is becoming diminished.
Dropsy comes on in the extremities. The heart gives out; there is emaciation; the hippocratic countenance is seen; there is cold sweat, blue face, sinking. Even now we can palliate with Tarantula Cubensis. Sometimes it has to be repeated. It will relieve for days and give an euthanasia, not a stupefaction as produced by Morphia, benumbing his senses, but an actual comforting.
Ruta Graveolens
Ruta is another remedy often overlooked. It is sometimes overlooked and Rhus or Argentum nitricum given, or other remedies not fully related to the case are given because Ruta is not well known.
Many of its symptoms are difficult to classify in the Repertory. A knowledge of its nature must be obtained. It falls under a class of complaints that resemble Rhus, in that it is sensitive to cold, aggravated from cold, damp weather; aggravated from becoming cold, and the complaints are often brought on from straining the part; overstraining or overexertion of parts, but principally confined to parts that are of a tendinous character aponeurotic fibres; white fibrous tissue; the flexor tendons especially flexor tendons that are overstrained by exertion.
Rhus has something like this, but nothing like what is found in Ruta. Ruta often suits in various surgical conditions; periosteal troubles from injury. Periosteal trouble where the flesh is thin over the bone; over the
tibia. Bruises go away slowly and leave a hardened spot; thickening of periosteum; a knotty, nodular condition; it remains sore; slow repair. A lump in the periosteum that has existed for months or years; sensitive and sore and nodular; as a result of a blow with a stick or a hammer, or from bumping the shin bone,
Bruises: In farmers, woodmen, mechanics, from holding a hammer or iron instrument; hard nodules form in the palm from clasping the hand over an iron instrument in projecting it forward, as from using a crowbar; a hardened mass of tissue in the tendons, like a bursa.
Tendency to the formation of deposits in the periosteum, in bone, in tendons, about joints. The especial location is in the wrist; bursae and nodules form in this part. Overstraining of tendons and in the place where it is likely to give out a nodule will form in the tendon; lumps, bunches, little tumors in the tendon. Gradually increasing contraction of flexors, so that the hands become permanently flexed; the foot becomes flexed so that the sole becomes increasingly concave, and the toes are drawn under from overstraining and violence to the flexors.
Eyes: Overstraining of the muscles of the eye.
These muscles are largely tendinous. Continual use until it becomes an overuse. Eyestrain followed by headache, and the effects are also; on the globe of the eye, and coating of the eye, so that the overstrained eye is red.
Pain in the eye, above and through the eye when he attempts to use the vision, that is, aggravation from the exertion of vision. From looking at fine print, fine sewing. This overexertion of vision brings about redness,
pain and inability to concentrate vision on one point.
Headache follows. Here Argentum nitricum resembles Ruta. Arg. nit. and Natrum mur are the two remedies most frequently used, but Onosmodium is a very frequently indicated remedy for headaches from eyestrain.
But they can be easily differentiated. Ruta is aggravated from cold, wants everything warm. Arg. nit. is aggravated from heat wants to be in a cool place. The patient must be considered.
There is general exhaustion in Ruta. The legs give out on rising from a chair, the patient totters and makes several efforts on rising from a seat. Routinists give Phosphorus and Conium for this. Ruta and Phosphorus both have violent, unquenchable thirst for ice-cold water. Compare Phos. and Con. because of the weakness through the hips and thighs.
Mind: The remedy has not been proved sufficiently to bring out the mental symptoms. They are only common and belong to many other remedies.
"Inclination to contradict and quarrel."
"Dissatisfied with himself and others."
"Anxious and low-spirited, with mental dejection."
These symptoms are only common; they can be grouped in one of two classes. The patient can be irritable, or the opposite-good-natured. This remedy is classified among the irritable.
"Despondent," that is, the opposite of happy-another of two classes. "Melancholy disposition toward evening."
The only thing here is that it is aggravated toward evening. When things are brought out so that they belong to one of two classes, they are important only in a mild degree.
Pains: Many of the complaints are worse lying down, especially the pains that are sharp, stinging, tearing in the nerves.
Ruta is a painful medicine, but is slow in producing symptoms, hence it of a chronic nature. Old neuralgias, stinging, tearing, burning pains, especially in the lower extremities, about the eyes; faceaches. It has all the pains, described by all the adjectives that apply to pain, but it is worse lying down and worse from cold.
Rending, tearing pains in the sciatic nerves. The severest forms of sciatica; pains commence in the back and go down the hips and thighs; tearing pains; comfortable during the day, but aggravated as soon as he lies down at night. Gnaphalium is a great sciatic remedy, and it also has this aggravation from lying down.
Eyes again: "Eyes feel hot like balls of fire."
To use Ruta for a pure inflammation when the eyes feel hot would be a failure. Euphrasia, Belladonna and Aconite are used in simple inflammations from a cold, and the, antipsorics when the case is chronic. But if a woman strains her eyes from long sewing on fine work, and the balls feel like fire, she needs Ruta. Aconite if after exposure to cold winds, there is inflammation with lachrymation, and the eyes look like raw beef.
"Eyes burn, ache, feel strained; sight blurred; aggravated from using them in the evening,"
In part of the general aggravation in the evening. When, in copying, the manuscript is placed here, and the copy at a different distance, this necessitates a constant change of vision in looking from one to the other, and especially if the copying is done in a poor light, a headache will come on, which Ruta will cure.
After overusing the eyes in this way, if the patient rides in a cold wind, a paralytic weakness results, and this is a further indication for Ruta. Lachrymation from exposure to the wind or riding in the cold. Paralysis of certain muscles of the eye, even strabismus; all sorts of disturbances of accommodation.
"Loss of power over internal rectus."
"Asthenopia; irritability of every tissue of eye from overwork or from using eyes on fine pork; beat and aching in and over eyes; eyes feel like balls of fire at night; blurring of vision; letters seem to run together, lachrymation, etc."
Amplyopia, dependent upon overexertion of eyes, or anomalies of refraction; from writing by artificial light.; fine needlework, etc. in a weaver, could with difficulty distinguish one, thread from another, and could not read at all; mistiness of sight, with complete obscuration at a distance.
Anus and rectum: Constipation is a striking feature, with prolapsus of the rectum at stool.
"Frequent unsuccessful urging with prolapsus ani."
"Protrusion of rectum after confinement.”
Pain in rectum when sitting. Great soreness in rectum as from ulceration. It is a useful remedy in piles and stricture of the rectum.
Back symptoms.
It is a decided rheumatic remedy. All those remedies which are susceptible to cold, aggravated by cold, wet, stormy weather, are described as rheumatic remedies.
Rheumatic symptoms of the back.
"Pains as if bruised in lumbar vertebrae."
"Pain in back or coccyx as from a fall or blow, or as if bruised."
"Hamstrings feel shortened and weak; knees give way going up or down stairs." "Pain and lameness in the ankles after sprain or dislocation."
"Lameness after sprains, especially of the wrists and ankles."
Immediately after a, sprain, for the inflammatory state, you will most likely need to give Arnica, and Rhus will probably follow. But when nodules occur in the tendons as a result of the strain, Ruta is called for.
Ruta is a great remedy for a mere sprain; it has all the soreness and weakness of tendons. Arnica, Rhus and Calcarea are often necessary in a routine way when there is absence of all symptoms, except the strain alone.
Paralytic weakness in the lower extremities after a sprain of the back. Under the aggravation in the evening is melancholy disposition, burning in the eyes, green halo around the light; sight blurred; eyes ache; pain below right scapula.
Extreme restlessness like Rhus. So restless be can't keep still; a nervous restlessness.
"Bruised feeling all over as from a fall or blow, worse in the limbs and joints."
"Bruises and other mechanical injuries of bones and periosteum; sprains; periostitis; erysipelas."
Ruta is related to and is an antidote to Mercury.
Eruptions on the skin with itching, which changes place after scratching like Mezereum. Compare Phos. in the thirst for cold water and the weakness of the lower extremities. In the rheumatism distinguish Phytolacca.
Compare Rhus, Sepia, Silicea and Sulphur. Ruta is an antipsoric, but not so deep as Silicea and Sulphur.
Sabadilla
Generals: The Sabadilla patient is a shivering patient, sensitive to the cold air, a cold room, cold food.
He wants to be well wrapped up; wants hot drinks to warm up his stomach. He is subject to catarrhal conditions, and in these he wants hot air. The catarrhal conditions of the throat require hot drinks and food. Warm things are grateful to him. It is difficult to swallow cold things; they increase the pain and difficulty in swallowing.
We often study remedies by contrast. This remedy travels from left to right, and at once a good prescriber connects it with Lachesis. The soreness, pain and inflarnmatory conditions of the throat commence on the left side and spread to the right in both Sabadilla and Lachesis. But warm things aggravate the pain in Lachesis; they cause a spasmodic condition, with a sensation of choking, and therefore he wants cold things, which relieve; they are swallowed more easily and ameliorate the pain in the throat. Sabadilla on the other hand is relieved by heat, either outside or inside.
Nose: Catarrhal condition of the nose, with constant sneezing; sensation of great rawness in the nose; burning; stuffing up of the nose.
Discharge at first of thin mums and later thick mucus. It has all the appearance of a coryza. The coryza is ameliorated from inhaling hot air. He sits before an open grate or register, with the head close to it, inhaling the hot air. Especially useful when the catarrhal state of the nose is prolonged; a prolonged coryza, which does not yield to ordinary remedies; a lingering coryza, and the discharge is exaggerated by the odor of flowers. Even thinking of the odor of flowers makes him sneeze and increases the flow from the nose. So thinking of various things aggravates his complaints.
Many hay fever patients are sensitive to the odor of flowers, to the, odor of the hay field, to dying vegetable matter; so oversensitive to the odor of fruit are some that apples have to be removed from the house. Inhalation of odors that are beautiful, as that of the lavender, some hay fever patients cannot tolerate; such things may bring on an attack out of the season. Now Sabadilla is of this sort oversensitive to surroundings, to odors; these increase the catarrhal state of the throat and posterior nares.
Sneezing and a flow of mucus from the nose; goes on even to ulceration. Periodical attacks; a rose cold in June; in autumn about August 20 as a hay fever. Hay fever is often an easy thing to palliate with short acting remedies; they will cut short an attack in a few days. But the cure requires years, and the patient must be treated in the interim and according to his symptoms. When the hay fever symptoms are present he has no others; one group is manifested at one time, and another group at another time. But the patient is sick and all the symptoms must be gathered together and the case treated accordingly.
Mind: Many of the annoyances of this individual seem to be imaginary.
His mind is filled with strange things. Imaginations concerning persons or himself are strange. Imagines the body is withering, that the limbs are crooked, that the chin is elongated, and larger on one side than the other. She feels that this is so and believes it even in spite of her vision. It is a sensation which she believes, a delusion, an insanity.
"Erroneous impressions as to the state of his body."
"Imagines himself sick; imagines parts shrunken; that she is pregnant when she is merely swollen from flatus; that she has some horrible throat disease that will end fatally."
The imaginations are groundless; nothing is visible, and the suffering is greater than if there was something to be seen. These patients often get no sympathy; they should really have a remedy. Thuja has erroneous impressions as to the state of the body; thinks she is made of glass; the idea is not that of transparency, but rather of brittleness fears that she would break in pieces.
There are but a few remedies which have fixed ideas; these ideas may be concerning religion, politics, clothing, things of the family and life. ] once had an insane patient who would get out of the street, ear if anyone entered who wore a certain color, because she had a fixed idea that this was of evil import to her.
The Pulsatilla mental state in a man is that a woman would be a detriment to his soul; it is a delusion, a fixed idea. Iodine is full of fixed ideas. Anacardium has a fixed idea that a devil is sitting on one shoulder talking into his ear, while an angel sits on the other shoulder talking into the other ear, and he halts between the two and says nothing.
"Delirium during intermittents." "Mental exertion aggravates the headache and produces sleep."
A sleepiness comes on from thinking, meditating, reading. While meditating in a chair he falls asleep like Nux moschata and Phosphoric acid.
Head: Dizziness; vertigo.
He wakens up at night with vertigo. Vertigo, in the open air; under all sorts of circumstances. Full of headaches. Headaches on one side of the head. The meditation which drives him to sleep brings on headache.
Headache in school girls. Feeble children, who have to be taken from school because of headache, come home with strange imaginations concerning school and themselves. Headache stupefying and associated with coryza; in the frontal sinuses, above the eyes.
Fullness, bursting, stupefying, aggravated by jarring, sneezing, walking. Stupefying headaches with coryza. Often gets up with it in the morning, increases during the forenoon. Head covered with a cold sweat. Many of the symptoms are closely related to Veratrum, especially in the cold sweat on the forehead with complaints.
Hay fever when there is spasmodic sneezing, fluent coryza; nostrils stuffed up; inspirations through nose labored; snoring; itching in the nose; profuse bleeding from the nose; bright red blood comes from the posterior nares and is expectorated; very sensitive to the smell of garlic; coryza with severe frontal pains and redness of eyelids; violent sneezing; copious watery discharge from the nose.
A peculiar kind of itching coming on in some hay fevers is an itching in the roof of the mouth, on the soft palate, and for relief the patient must draw the tongue back and forth over the soft palate, with this coryza, sneezing, etc. Wyethia will cut the attack short.
When the itching extends to the larynx and trachea, with great irritability and sensitive to cold: Nux vomica.
When the discharge burns a red streak over the upper lip and about the wings of the nose, with sneezing and profuse, watery nasal discharge: Arsenicum.
Copious acrid lachrymation, and copious bland flow from the nose with sneezing: Euphrasia.
Copious, bland, watery discharge from the eyes and copious, acrid, watery discharge from the nose: Allium cepa.
But these are not the constitutional remedies; they do not cure, but only palliate during the severe attacks. These symptoms are the outcome of the psoric constitution, and this constitution must be treated by antipsorics. Sometimes the hay fever is so severe that it seems to be the only manifestation of psora in the patient, but if it is restrained or stopped up by bad treatment he is not well during the whole year.
If let alone he has good health during the rest of the year. Many a time the hay fever goes through the whole winter and only by constitutional up building can it be mitigated. But with constitutional treatment each yearly attack is lighter, and at the end of treatment he is able to live in his own climate unaffected.
He must not go to the mountains to mitigate it. If to any place, he should go where the affection would be worse, so that all its manifestations would be apparent. The hay fever will only be cured if the patient is curable, but if not, if his constitution is so broken down that he is incurable, his hay fever will not be cured.
The most striking place of attack is the mucous membrane of the nose, throat, trachea and larynx. Violent acute inflammation of the mucous membrane of these parts.
Stomach: Great thirst for hot drinks.
The appetite is singular; it is commonly seen in pregnant women. She says she is never hungry; never wants anything to eat, and often there is an aversion to food; but when, from a matter of reason, she concludes to eat, and she takes a mouthful, it tastes good, it recalls the appetite, and she makes a good meal. At other times not only a loss of appetite, but a disgust and loathing of food.
"Disgust for all food, for meat, for sour things, for coffee, for garlic." "Morbid hunger or loathing for food."
A routine remedy in pin worms, seat worms, all sorts of worms stomach and tape worms. A careful prescriber never thinks of prescribing for worms. He takes all the symptoms of the patient and these guide him to the remedy. I remember one time in a lady's house seeing a dog drag his hinder parts over the carpet as if to scratch the anus. She said:
"Doctor, can't you give the dog a remedy?"
I put a dose of Sabadilla in its mouth. Some time afterwards she asked me: "Doctor, what did you give the dog that medicine for?"
I inquired why she asked.
"Why," she said, "in a few days it passed an awful lot of worms."
Sabadilla and Sinapis nigra are well adapted to cases in which pin worms are present. Often a remedy restores the patient to order in general and then all his particular parts are set in order.
Female sexual organs. "Nymphomania from ascarides." "Cutting pains, as from knives, in ovary."
"Menses too late, with painful bearing down a few days previous; decreased, How by fits and. starts, sometimes stronger, sometimes weaker; blood bright red."
Hysterical patients; a patient with a strangely unbalanced mind, accompanied by various nervous manifestations.
"Twitchings, convulsive tremblings, or catalepsy from worms."
It is true that worms will not prosper in a perfectly healthy stomach, intestine or rectum. They can only thrive in the unhealthy. Many a time I have had a patient bring me a tape-worm in a bottle after I had put them on an antipsoric, even when I did not suspect its existence.
Turn the economy into order and the parasites go. The same applies to germs. They only exist as a result of disease. They have never been known to exist without the disease having first existed. If you ignore the worm, but select the remedy on the totality of the symptoms, the patient will be restored to health, and, so far as the worm is concerned, go without a symptom.
The worm becomes smaller, shrivels and finally departs. It is rarely the case for the worm to disappear inside of six weeks after the remedy. If, on the other hand, you eject the worm by violent means, the patient may go for years with troublesome symptoms, and you do not know why you fail to cure him.
Prescribe for the patient first. No results of disease should be removed until proper constitutional treatment has been resorted to, and be sure that it is proper.
Sabina
Generalities: The use of this remedy is generally confined to symptoms of the kidneys, bladder, uterus, rectum and anus; inflammatory and hemorrhagic symptoms principally of these parts.
Sabina establishes a turmoil in the circulatory system, with violent pulsations all over the body. The patient is disturbed by heat, is worse in a warm room or from too much clothing. Wants the windows open and to be in the open air (Puls.). This turmoil in the circulatory system is such as might be expected ina hemorrhagic remedy.
Inflammation and bleeding: Tendency to bleed from all the mucous membranes, especially of the kidney, bladder and uterus. It has a decided effect in diminishing knots, enlargements, or varices in veins. The principal action is on the lower bowel, about the anus. Hoemorrhoidal tumors which bleed copiously. Constipation with bleeding hemorrhoids. A sense of fullness in these parts.
A sense of fullness in all the veins of the body, a sense of distension, fullness, puffiness, bloating, with pulsations all over, associated with repeated hemorrhages from the mucous membranes.
Great burning and throbbing. Severe suffering, attended with inflammatory symptoms; bloody urine; inflammation of the bladder with continuous urging to urinate, with the general aggravation from heat and the throbbing all over.
Inflammation of the urethra, with a gonorrhoeal discharge, or a catarrhal discharge in the male. The most important sphere is in menstrual symptoms, and its relation to uterine hemorrhage. In the menstrual symptoms the woman suffers from bearing down, labor-like pains. Most distressing in dysmenorrhoea.
Women: The menses last too long and are too copious, and at times in some subjects the flow does not stop before the next period begins.
Too frequent and prolonged copious menses. A striking feature in this drug, as in a few other remedies, is that the flow is liquid, bright red, intermingled with clots. It suits many cases in which the flow slackens up and remains away for a while and then labor-pains come on, and an enormous, partially decomposed clot is passed and this is followed by a bright red flow. This occurs over and over again.
Such a state comes on after abortion, after labor and in dysmenorrhoea. Accompanying the labor-like pains is a violent pain in the sacrum, to the uterus or pubes. Another striking feature is itching, shooting, knife- like pains, causing the patient to scream out, shooting up the vagina to the uterus, or up as far as the umbilicus. These two features, shooting pains from the back to the front and from. below upwards, with hemorrhages, are striking corroborations.
Belladonna and Sabina are the two most important remedies in abortion at three months. Bell. has the same bearing down pains which expel a clot followed by a copious, bright red flow. But the Bell. state is not like that of Sabina. In Bell. it is a hyperesthesia, oversensitiveness to touch and jar; the patient will not allow the nurse to jar the bed, and the bright red flow is hot, so much so that it is noticeable; the parts over which the flow passes are so sensitive that the blood feels intensely hot to her.
This is in keeping with the oversensitiveness of Bell., to touch, light, motion, jar. If the physician jars the bed a scowl will immediately come over the patient's face. Bell. has many pains, not only shooting up but in every direction, irregular pains and bearing down pains. They come and go like lightning, appear suddenly and disappear suddenly, shooting in every direction. If these symptoms are present you will never need Ergot for its physiological effects.
It has often been argued that in these cases of haemorrhage you "won't have time to get the symptoms." The expert physician will often see all these symptoms in the twinkling of an eye. The actions of the patient, a word dropped by the nurse, and what he has observed himself, will have shown him the remedy.
Abortion: As a medicine to prevent abortion it is one of the first to consider, because the symptoms we know are such as come during abortion, and it is most useful after the membranes have ruptured, or the ovum passed, or when the placenta is about to be expelled.
It establishes the normal activities of the uterus so that it will expel whatever is left behind of these membranes. The curetting is never necessary with the homeopathic remedy. It suggests that there is something defective about the woman's organs.
"Inflammation of the ovaries or uterus after abortion or premature labor."
Violent pains through ovaries and uterus. Aching in the sacrum. as if broken, as if the bones would separate. Most violent, tearing, rending, burning pains, with throbbing in the sacrum, with burning and throbbing all over the body, especially throbbing in parts, whether it be the uterus or bladder.
"Copious hemorrhages, accompanied by uterine colic."
Contractive labor-like pains extending from back to pubes and great urging to urinate.
Women again: The uterine colic described is labor-like, drawing up like colic, but also bearing down as if to expel the clot.
Metrorrhagia, resulting from false plethora; clotted and fluid blood; pain extending from sacrum or lumbar region to pubes, with severe bearing down, extending from lower part of back around abdomen and down thighs; blood bright red, thin, liquid; labor-like pains in lumbar and uterine region, discharge of large clots of blood, bright red, coming in gushes, particularly profuse on motion, etc.
This describes the symptoms from abortion or menstruation.
"Menses too profuse, too early, last too long, partly fluid, partly clotted and offensive; flow in paroxysms; with colic and labor-like pains; pains from sacrum to pubes."
At another time, during the climacteric period, a woman is run down by overwork and much child bearing; she has repeated uterine hemorrhages of this character, bright red intermingled with clots; pain from sacrum. to pubes; she becomes exhausted and anemic, but after a while she again builds up, her face becomes plump and she becomes plethoric, only to be broken by another hemorrhage. Uterine hemorrhage in fibroids.
Chronic catarrh of vagina with granulations, copious leucorrhea. Bloody leucorrhea. Old, prolonged, psoric cases. This medicine especially suits gonorrhea in women. It has all the wart-like excrescences found in Thuja, and found in sycosis.
The Thuja wart is a little sensitive wart, appears to be covered with a thin film, and bleeds from the slightest touch. Sabina cures warty excrescences about the anus, cauliflower excrescences, gonorrhoeal warts about the vulva and about the male genitals.
In the uterine hemorrhages compare it with Ipecacuanha, which has a gush of bright red blood fully as copious as Sabina, but at the beginning of that gush, before it has kept on long enough to produce exhaustion, the face becomes pale, there is nausea and a feeling of faintness, syncope, all out of proportion to the amount of blood lost.
Millefolium produces a gushing flow, but it has a continuous dribbling day after day, a continuous flow of bright red blood.
Secale looks like Sabina, and when it is indicated it should never be given in large quantities. it has the expulsive, bearing down, labor-like pains, with the expulsion of large clots and copious flow, but the flow is dark and offensive and after a short time it becomes thin and watery, leaving a brown stain difficult to wash out; at times tarry, copious and continuous, as if the uterus had no ability to contract.
If you observe the cases in which during labor or abortion crude Ergot had been used, you will notice that the patient has feeble uterine contractions as a resultant condition, and this will be seen during the menses or in the next labor.
The symptoms of Ergot last for years; it is another psora. Large doses may kill the foetus and cause abortion, but she will continue to bleed; the uterus will not contract when she most needs contractions. It produces a
paralytic condition, and this is the state we prescribe Secale for. We seldom prescribe it for its primary effect, but rather for the state of sub-involution, when the uterus retains the secundines.
There is a continuous oozing of dark and offensive flow. The picture is more complete if we find that no matter how cool the room is, she does not want heat, but wants to be uncovered, and she is a lean, shrivelled, scrawny, hungry patient with dusky skin; she never takes on fat; is not robust. It produces varicoses of the skin and the skin about the toes becomes dusky, and over the shin bones are dark spots, and she wants to lie with the extremities uncovered. Such patients lose flesh and become shrivelled.
In old, troublesome, lingering hemorrhages, starting up fresh on the slightest provocation, Sabina will stop the gush, the acute stage, but it does not hold, the haemorrhage recurs, and then an antipsoric is needed.
Sulphur is very commonly the remedy, but Psorinum, though not laid down in the books for hemorrhages, after Sulphur has exhausted, itself, will often follow for this oozing and frequent recurrence.
Phosphorus is somewhat like Sabina. it has a copious bright red flow, which may or may not contain clots. The striking features are outside the flow. There is pinched countenance, extremely dry tongue and mouth; violent, unquenchable thirst, craving ice-cold water. The haemorrhage is bright red, in a gush or continuous oozing.
In this way we must study well the hemorrhagic remedies. The physician must be acquainted with the emergency remedies, such as belong to the violent diarrheas, cholera, violent sufferings and hemorrhages. He must have them at his finger ends, and he must be able to compare instantaneously. Blood must be stopped.
Atony of the uterus is a striking feature of Sabina. The uterus will not contract on itself until it has something to contract on, like a clot or mole. Hemorrhages from other parts as well. But other remedies have taken its place in these regions because the individualizing symptoms have not been brought out.
Rheumatism: Much rheumatism and gout; gouty nodosities in the joints; they burn so and are so hot that the patient is compelled to put the hands or feet out of bed.
Gouty cases, especially when the constitutional state changes; an alternation; when the gout is present there will be no hemorrhages, and when there are hemorrhages the gout will be relieved.
An alternation of states The gouty condition of the veins is often a hemorrhagic state.
Sanguinaria
Generalities: Blood root is an old domestic remedy. A great many eastern farmers’ wives will not go into the winter without blood root in the house.
In the cold winter days, when the coryzas come on, a "cold" in the head, throat and chest, then they get the blood root ready and make a tea of it. With them it is a routine remedy for "colds." They give it to combat all complaints, and there is no doubt but that even in this crude form it does break up "colds," because the provings show its relation to chest troubles and "colds" that go to the chest.
Head: Periodic headaches, when the headache comes once in seven days it begins in the morning on waking or wakes the patient up.
It begins in the occiput and travels upward and settles over the right eye and in the right temple. It gets worse during the day and is aggravated by light, so that he is driven into a dark room and compelled to lie down.
Vomiting comes on and the vomited matter is bile, slime, bitter substance and food, and then comes relief of the pain. The headaches are, relieved from passing flatus up or down. If the patient suffers when he goes to bed with hot palms and soles, so that he must put them out of bed, this is an additional striking feature.
Take an individual who has missed his chronic headache, by some means, for a considerable time, but since then he has become increasingly sensitive to cold, and "colds" settle in the nose, throat and bronchial tube and these parts feel as if on fire, with rawness and burning; the expectoration is thick, tenacious mucus; disturbance of the belly, with much belching, and the belching is especially noticed after a violent attack of coughing.
It is not a very long acting remedy. When a periodic sick headache is interrupted by Sanguinaria, if a deeper drug, an antipsoric, is not given, the headache will return or something worse will come on, as Sanguinaria does not go deep into the nature of the case. | remember a case in which the patient missed his Sanguinaria headache and an epithelioma developed, which was cured by Phosphorus.
Tam convinced that if Phosphorus had been given at the end of the attack the cancer would not have developed, as Phosphorus was his constitutional remedy. If a chronic sick headache is interrupted the patient will tend to phthisis.
Chest: Chest troubles come on and grow worse and worse. Its ability to palliate phthisis is very well known.
A patient much debilitated with bronchial catarrh; susceptible to cold, to every change in the weather, from change to damp weather, to every draft, to change of clothing; always taking new "cold."
There is burning in the chest behind the sternum; thick, tough, ropy expectoration; spasmodic cough, and every cough ends in belching; eructations of gas; empty eructations. If to the burning in the chest, the severe pains in the larynx and trachea when talking, and cough ending in belching, you add heat in the palms and, soles, Sanguinaria will patch him up and mitigate the trouble.
Many such cases get Sulphur, but to their destruction. There is a class of remedies that suits these phthisical patients better than Sulphur, Silicea and Graphites; remedies such as Pulsatilla, Sanguinaria, Senecio gracilis and Coccus cacti, which palliate, mitigate his sufferings, and may even build him up so that he could take a
medium potency of a deep remedy.
But the deeper remedies ought to be avoided if the vital force is low, if the body is too much damaged to be repaired. Hahnemann warned against the use of Phosphorus in such cases of deficient vitality. Sanguinaria is a surface remedy; it does excellent palliation.
Nose and throat: Catarrhal conditions of nose and throat, especially those due to colds and to poisonous plans; also rue colds.
The Sanguinaria patient has "rose colds" in June. Sensitive to flowers and odors; subjects with bay fever. Hay fever patients with burning in the nose, in the throat, as if dry; as if the mucous membrane would crack open.
Dryness and burning in the larynx, with hoarseness; dryness and burning throughout the chest, with asthma; associated with burning of the palms and soles. Examination shows the palms to be dry, wrinkled and hot to the touch; so, also, the soles, where the skin is thickened and indurated. Corns that burn; the toes burn and the patient puts the feet out of bed for relief.
Head again: When the headache is present it seems to be a general congestive headache; although beginning in the morning, coming up the back and extending to the right eye, the whole head is hot and aches.
Sulphur, Silicea and Sanguinaria have periodic weekly headaches. Arsenicum has a headache every two weeks. Not that these remedies will not cure other headaches, for Sanguinaria has also a headache every three days. The majority of headaches coming every two weeks are cured by Arsenicum or greatly mitigated in broken down constitutions. The attempt to cure a chronic sick headache should be made before the senile decline.
"Pulsations in the head with bitter vomiting; aggravated by motion."
The headache is generally aggravated by motion, but not so strikingly as in Bryonia. When the Sanguinaria headache increases. towards the afternoon or night, it becomes so severe he must go to bed; and the head becomes sore, and then a step or jar is extremely painful. A severe headache is likely to be disturbed by light, noise, motion, etc.
"Headache as if forehead would burst with chill, and burning in stomach." "Headache over right eye." This is a characteristic feature.
"Periodic sick headache; begins in the morning, increases during the day, lasts till evening; head feels as if it must burst, or as if eyes would be pushed out; throbbing, lancinating pains through brain, worse on the right side, especially in the forehead and vertex; followed by chills, nausea, vomiting of food or bile; must lie down or remain quiet; ameliorated by sleep."
Some of these things are not found in every case, but they all go to make up a Sanguinaria headache.
Pains: All sorts of neuralgic pains; cutting, tearing, lacerating pains; as if the muscles were torn, or put on a stretch.
Tearing pains anywhere, neuralgic or rheumatic. Pains about the scalp, but more particularly about the shoulder and neck; stiff neck; cannot turn over in bed; cannot raise the arm, though he can swing it back and forth.
Pain streaks up the neck; pain in the deltoid. It prefers the right side, but also cures the left side. Rheumatic pains in the right shoulder so that ho cannot raise the arm, and all the muscles of the neck and back of the neck become involved; stiff neck. If the pain comes on in the day it increases as the day advances to night. Complaints are worse at night in Sanguinaria.
A patient comes to you after exposure to cold; he cannot raise the arm; it hangs by his side; pain worse at night in bed, worse turning over (as he uses the shoulder muscle to turn over). It is probably in the deltoid, but you need not speculate on the tissues involved.
It competes with Ferrum. All red-faced, highly-flushed people, who cannot raise the arm and have pain which is worse in the daytime, not night, and ameliorated by slow motion need Ferrum. Sanguinaria is not relieved by motion; it is aggravated by such motion as calls the arm into use. Ferrum has relief from slow motion, aggravated from rapid motion and the pain comes in the daytime.
While Ferrum has a uniformly red, plethoric face, Sanguinaria has a pale face. In the chest complaints Sanguinaria has a circumscribed red spot over the malar bones, such as seen in hectic patients.
Headache from stomach disturbances, overeating, rich food, drinking wine. Almost as useful as Nux in old drinkers. Those who disorder their stomachs and weaken their digestion by beer drinking; they cannot eat; vomiting of even a teaspoonful of water.
No food or drink stays on the stomach. Headaches associated with such troubles. Vomiting and diarrhea with complaints.
Catarrhal affections are prominent.
Chronic catarrh of the throat apparent thickening of the mucous membranes of the throat. Nose and pharynx fill with mucus. He hawks it out; there is a dry burning sensation, but the burning is most marked every time he takes a fresh cold.
Acridity of discharges is another feature. Acrid mucus forms in the nose, causing burning in the throat. Acrid, hot fluids eructated from the stomach, excoriating the throat and mouth. The diarrhea is accompanied by an acrid watery stool; especially in infants; the nates become raw and red. This burning extends all through the bowels; burning in the abdomen and stomach in old gastric troubles; vomiting of even a teaspoonful of water with burning; old gastric irritation; dyspepsia; all sorts of disorders of the stomach.
Tongue red and burns as if in contact with something hot. Burning in pharynx and oesophagus, burning in roof of mouth. Tonsillitis with burning.
"Heat in throat, ameliorated by inspiring cold air; throat so dry it seems as if it would crack."
This burning excoriated feeling applies to all the mucous membranes affected.
Patient suddenly taken w bed with a chill; burning in the chest symptoms of pneumonia; rusty expectoration; violent cough; every cough felt as a concussion at the bifurcation of the trachea; as if a knife
were in the parts; as if torn asunder; and after the cough copious, loud, empty eructations. No other remedy has this.
"Nausea with burning at the stomach, with much spitting."
Nausea not relieved by vomiting. Keeps on vomiting and retching. Burns as if on fire. Arsenic is often given by mistake, because of the great burning.
"Vomiting of bitter water; of sour, acrid fluids; of ingesta; of worms; preceded by anxiety; with headache and burning in stomach; head relieved afterwards; with prostration."
Such symptoms occur in headache, disordered stomach, sour stomach. The sour stomach is manifested by sour eructations or sour vomiting. A patient often speaks of "a sour stomach," and you must find out whether be means sour eructations or sour vomiting.
He says he "spits up" sour food.
With the headache and many complaints Sanguinaria has a faintness; like a hunger, yet not for food. A sinking, faint, "all gone,” empty feeling. It is like Phosphorus with its "hungry headache."
Psorinum leads all others in "hungry headaches," but Psorinum wants to eat and cannot get enough.
Sanguinaria has a hunger, but it is not for food; aversion at the thought and smell of food. Psorinum can eat a wolf meal, and so can Phosphorus. It is a false hunger with the headache in Sanguinaria.
"Burning in stomach; with headache and chill."
Belching up of acrid fluids in asthma; hay asthma. Sanguinaria palliates asthma associated with stomach disorders. Do not forget Nux in asthma from stomach troubles.
Liver complaints; pains and aches and sense of fullness. Bilious trouble described in general terms. It seems as if the liver makes an enormous quantity of bile, but there is a gastro-duodenal catarrh, so that the bile is regurgitated into the stomach instead of going down, and it is eructated as bitter, green, yellow fluid; vitiated bile.
This is a peculiar thing. If you watch a chronic Sanguinaria patient you will notice that the stomach will be disordered for a week; spitting up bile much flatulence; sour hot eructations; then all at once this will disappear, and a diarrhoea, which fairly floods him, comes on suddenly; a bilious, liquid, gushing stool. Natrum sulph., Sanguinaria, Pulsatilla and Lycopodium cure this alternation of diarrhoea and constipation.
"Os uteri ulcerated; foetid, corrosive leucorrhoea."
"Distension of abdomen in the evening and flatulent discharges by vagina from os uteri, which was constantly open; at same time a pain passing in rays from nape of neck to head."
"Chronic dryness in throat, sensation of swelling in the larynx and expectoration of thick mucus when associated with dryness, rawness, burning and smarting."
"Whooping cough; constricted, spasmodic across throat beneath jaws; cough worse at night with diarrhoea."
Cough worse at night with diarrhoea is the feature this remedy is prescribed for.
"Severe cough occurring after whooping cough when patient takes cold, which partakes of the spasmodic nature of whooping cough.”
An adult takes cold and has a spasmodic cough, like whooping cough. He says it is a stomach cough, because there is a gagging with it. In all there is burning and diarrhoea.
"Distressing, dry, spasmodic, exhaustive coughs, especially in children; worse towards night, lying down, going into a cold room to. sleep, feeling of rawness and burning in bronchi."
The trachea seems so sore, and it is sore; a bolus of food passing down the oesophagus can be plainly felt; he can outline the part where the food passes.
Sarsaparilla
Generalities: Sarsaparilla is suitable in low forms of chronic disease, especially in complex states resulting from mixed miasms; especially in cases of sycosis and syphilis; cases made complex by Mercury, sycosis syphilis, and psora. Weakness stamps itself on the whole economy, as in Merc., Lach. and other remedies.
Weakness: The tissues become flabby, refuse to heal when injured, ulcerate from slight causes. After an injury an open sore remains and is indolent or becomes phagedenic and spreads like. Ars., Lach and Merc. cor.
Weakness over the whole body; a paralytic feeling. In the mental sphere it manifests itself in a dazed state, he is unable to comprehend, the mind is slow, it is a weakness bordering on imbecility, which in the end it may reach. Weakness of the mind and the tissues.
All the organs are slowed down, weak, sluggish, become congested. Weakness and dilatation of the veins, tendency to form varices in the limbs, varicose ulcers, hemorrhoids, varicose veins of the face and body.
The face is often red and discolored in patches. When the circulation is feeble the parts turn blue, over the shin bones; on the backs of the feet, toes; blue spots like approaching senile gangrene, Useful in old age when black and blue spots appear on the backs of the hands and elsewhere.
Moist, itching, scurfy, and scabby eruptions. The skin of the backs and the palms of the hands becomes thick and indurated with a bran like scurf resembling psoriasis, intermingling with blue spots.
This remedy has many features as to cold and heat. The use of heat internally aggravates all complaints, but there is an external coldness relieved by heat; taking warm food and drink aggravates; wants cold food, but heat applied externally is grateful.
Secale also produces great weakness of tissue, with venous stasis ulceration and gangrene. But the two remedies, though similar in appearance, differ in regard to heat and cold.
The stomach is in a most miserable condition. Flatulence, continuous nausea, eructations and vomiting of sour food. Always complaining of fermentation and uneasiness of the stomach as if he had overeaten or as if the food had spoiled; digestion is slow and feeble.
Organs become tumid and congested. The throat, tongue, and mouth look as if about to ulcerate; purple spots look as if they would break down, but remain intact for weeks and months.
Oedema of tissues, of lower extremities, pitting on pressure dropsical conditions; Bright's disease. Suitable in old syphilitics whose complaints have been suppressed by Mercury; mind and body in a state of prostration; paralytic weakness of the lower extremities, no endurance; the heart palpitates on exertion;
suffocation on the least exertion; always tired; ulcers here and there on the body; the skin is flabby and full of distress at night. Bone-pains worse at night. Sars. antidotes the Merc. and establishes reaction.
Children: Marasmus of children from hereditary syphilis; emaciation about the neck; dry, purple, copper- like eruptions; no assimilation.
The child is always passing sand in its diaper, yellowish, or whitish like chalk; the child screams when it is about to urinate, because it remembers how painful the passing of urine is. Sometimes at the close of urination it gives forth an unearthly yell. This symptom is found in old broken down constitutions, a clutch in the bladder just as it shuts down causes him to carry out; pain at the end of urination.
Old debauches, enfeebled by wine and women, with weak heart, lungs, brain, and bladder, emaciated and shrivelled. Prematurely old, a man of forty looks to be eighty, feet swollen, totters about on a staff. Nux will palliate in early periods of breakdown, but the time comes when he is weak in body and mind and must have such remedies as Sars., Lach., Secale, etc.
Children emaciated; face looks like old people; big belly; dry, flabby skin; mushy passages. Eruptions appear in the Spring. All the venous remedies are braced up by Winter and go down in the Spring, as Lach., Secale and Hamam.
Urinary: Catarrh of the bladder and kidneys.
Involuntary urination of children at night in bed, in feeble children. There is a spasmodic condition of the sphincter when sitting to urinate, which makes the act impossible in that position, but when he stands up the urine flows freely.
This is especially important when the symptom occurs in women, because they have great difficulty in urinating while standing. Copious urine at night; he floods the bed, but during the day be can pass it only when standing.
It is fifteen years since I reported the following case and the man has remained well ever since:
"A man, aet. 52, addicted to whiskey for years, had a copious flow of blood from the bowels some four months ago; the exertion of walking a few blocks causes suffocation; after the loss of blood, feet began to swell, both limbs to middle of thigh very oedematous, has had two or three nondescript chills; a few
months ago, sudden paralytic weakness of left arm and leg, passed off in three hours leaving a numbness in left hand and a tearing pain in left side of face and head; no appetite; bloody discharge with stools; feels as if in a dream all the time; loss of memory; face covered with varicose veins and very red; general venous stasis; feeling on the top of the head as if struck with a hammer; must pass urine several times in a night; urine thick and cloudy after standing; but clear when first passed; has bad much worry from financial troubles; cannot pass urine, when sitting at stool, but flows freely when he is standing, albumen in the urine.”
When Sars. can take such a man, 52 years old, and restore him to health it is worth considering. "Jerking sensation along the male urethra." "Each time she makes water, air passes out of the urethra with a gurgling noise."
This symptom is common in catarrh of the bladder; it is caused by fermentation of the mucus and consequent formation of gas.
"Frequent ineffectual urging to urinate with diminished secretion,"
This medicine has many times dissolved a stone in the bladder; it so changes the character of the urine that it is no, longer possible for the stone to build up, and it grows smaller by the continual dissolving off from the surface.
I have seen the high colored, bloody, and mucous urine cleared up after the administration of Sars., but on standing, the sand would appear. When the urine again becomes cloudy, it is time for another dose. The urine holds in solution, that is, actually dissolves the substance of the stone.
Some years ago there was an old man upon whom a surgeon was expected to operate. They had sounded his bladder and said that he had a stone, but he came to the conclusion that he would not permit the operation. In spite of their warnings he sent for me and I took charge of his case. His symptoms called for Sars. The enormous amount of sand he passed in the next year was wonderful. It mitigated the catarrh and kept the bladder comfortable. At the end of a year, after a night of great suffering, he passed a stone the size of a pea. He passed several small stones after that and then returned to health.
A young man passed so much crusty deposit that I ordered him to use one commode and let it settle, pouring off the urine. At the end of a month there was a layer a sixteenth of an inch thick. This patient under Sars. had no stone. The sand continued to pass, but was held in solution and deposited only on cooling. In the course of time it disappeared. He was of a gouty nature and this was relieved.
Sars. has gouty nodes with extreme soreness. After the remedy has been given, there is a deposit of sand in the urine, which shows the good action of the remedy and should not be stopped.
"Obstinate constipation with violent urging to urinate; urging top stool with contraction of the intestines; excessive pressure from above downward, as if the bowels were pressing out; during stool, violent tearing, cutting, in the rectum.
Stool small, with much bearing down."
"Old, dry, sycotic warts remaining after Mercurial treatment for gouty pains."
Secale Cornutum
The best provers of Secale, those who are most susceptible to its action, are scrawny people, and they are the ones who will most likely need it as their curative remedy.
Aspect: Of course, it is not necessarily contra-indicated in fat people. Certain constitutions are mentioned in connection with a remedy as being suited to it, but it must not be inferred that no action will result in others when the symptoms agree. Scrawny people are especially related to Secale.
Emaciated, withered, wrinkled, unhealthy appearance of the skin; purplish, bluish skin, general or in spots; purplish I spots on withered skin, especially where the circulation is feeble as on the back of the hands and feet and on the tibia.
These parts become numb, tingle and wither. The extremities prickle, burn, and tingle; creeping and crawling, as of insects under the skin, as if between the skin and the flesh; numb, dead, wooden sensation in the fingers and especially in the toes.
The toes become black, gangrenous. A senile withering, such as is found in feeble old people; the blood- vessels close up; no blood goes to the toes and they become numb and black, devoid of sensation. Hence, Secale improves the circulation of the aged and postpones senile gangrene.
Burning: is a feature of this remedy; the skin burns; the extremities burn, sensation of burning when the parts feel cold to the touch and really are cold, a sensation of heat with coldness.
Burning, especially of internal parts. Dryness with burning; burning in the stomach and bowels; dryness and burning in the mouth and throat, the nose and air passages; burning in the lungs.
This remedy produces ulceration even to sloughing. Old ulcers take on a strange, withered appearance; dryness with no, granulations; a shiny, blackish aspect and all at once blackish granulations shoot out, indolent, and finally forming a black sphacelus which slowly separates; the part is dry; there is no discharge except now and then a little bleeding of black blood.
Oozing of black, liquid blood, oozing when there is no inflammation; nose-bleed of dark, venous, offensive, fluid blood, bleeding from the throat, lungs, bladder, and rectum, of dark blood; urine like ink.
Women: Prolonged uterine haemorrhage so that one menstrual nisus runs into another; withered subjects; considerable flow on the first day, fluid, and blackish; this goes on for a couple of weeks and then a dark watery flow comes on which lasts until the next period.
Then comes the thick, black, fluid, horribly offensive flow again. Such a state is found in the woman who has taken ergot to produce abortion, or in sensitive women who have been dosed with it to facilitate delivery. Of course, if the woman is not sensitive you will not get the lingering provings,
Some women are so insane that though they die they will get rid of their offspring. On all hands women say,
"I have had no health since I aborted."
The worst state of health is produced by ergot; it establishes a miasm as deep as psora itself. The duke to destroy the offspring is an engraftment on psora and by ergot she takes on a miasm as dangerous as sycosis or syphilis.
I have patients who took ergot to cause abortion, and I can do nothing more than palliate them. They have Secale symptoms, sequelae, and their psoric symptoms are suppressed, held down, just as syphilis holds down psoric manifestations; only by covering the Secale miasm and getting at the psora can we help the patient.
They have placed themselves beyond the help of the physician and the ergot will shorten their lives many years unless they are fortunate enough to have careful prescribing continuously while they live.
Modalities: The general constitutional state is aggravated from heat; there are only a few exceptions to this.
Wants cold though the limbs are cold as ice, wants to be uncovered, wants the windows open; a patient with hemorrhages wants the covers off though the room is cold. A patient with ulcers wants to be uncovered; in inflammatory condition of the stomach and bowels, wants the abdomen uncovered.
At times there is a lingering state of heat of the skin and the patient wants to be covered up; there are also sharp, stinging neuralgic pains, which burn like fire and cut like a knife and are relieved by the application of beat; headache worse in cold air.
But the general state is ameliorated from uncovering, in a cold room, and from cold air blowing on the patient.
Violent inflammation of any part of the body; gangrenous pneumonia; gastritis; peritonitis; inflammation of the uterus and ovaries. In inflammatory conditions it competes with Ars.
The symptoms are so nearly alike in both that it is difficult to differentiate; both have violently distended abdomen; tympanites; burning like coals of fire; violent thirst; extreme sensitiveness and tenderness to touch, so that motion or jar is unbearable; vomiting of blood; expulsion of blood-clots; horrible, offensive, bloody discharge from the bowels; but they are different in the generals. Ars. wants to be covered up, to be kept warm, to have hot applications, either wet or dry, while Secale wants to be uncovered, wants the cold air.
Convulsions: of single parts or of the whole muscular system; opisthotonos; cramps in the calves, thighs, soles of the feet, and hands, hysterical contractures, a hysterical diathesis.
Convulsions begin in the face. Active manias with great excitement; exposes her body and tears at the genitals; puts her finger in the vagina and scratches until the lips bleed; all idea of modesty lost.
The spasms, nervous, and mental symptoms are worse while she is flowing, so that a puerperal convulsion comes on in the midst of a hemorrhage.
From the hemorrhagic tendency and the ability to destroy the red blood corpuscle, there is anemia. The face looks like dried beef, wrinkled, shrivelled, scrawny, as if it had not been washed; as if grey dirt had dried on the skin, and this especially on the extremities a dirty, grey appearance.
Catarrhal affections of all mucus membranes; they are dry and bleed; blood oozes from the catarrhal surfaces, liquid, black, and offensive, coagulating slowly or not at all.
"Nosebleed, blood dark, runs continually, with great prostration, small thread-like pulse; in old people or drunkards; of young women; from debility."
Those poisoned by ergot become victims of opacity of the lens as in senile debility; cataract of old persons.
The withered scrawny person with tendency to ulcerations, unhealthy skin and aggravation from heat, is striking in both acute and chronic states.
Chronic diarrhoea exhaustive, watery discharges, cholera. It is related to Camphor, Scrawny people take cholera, skin cold and blue; better from cold. Violent and continued thirst.
Diarrhoea and hemorrhages are likely to come together; diarrhoea of bloody water or dark liquid blood.
Large doses produce such contractures of the uterus that its contents are expelled and an exhausting hemorrhage follows; expulsion of large clots and in the early stages mixed with some red blood, but the most striking feature is liquid, black discharge.
"Asiatic cholera with collapse, sunken, distorted face, particularly the mouth, crawling sensation as of ants." Paretic condition; paralysis of lower extremities; of one side; of one arm or one leg; paralysis of the upper extremities with tingling, numbness, and prickling. Numbness and burning down the whole length of the
spine; general emaciation or only of diseased part.
Eruptions, abscesses, boils carbuncles; green pus discharged; a green, purplish appearance; boils small with green contents, mature and heal slowly.
Establishes sterility; so weak is the uterus that it can never hold the foetus, hence the value in sterility and repeated abortions.
Dwindling of the mammae. Absence of milk after confinement. "Thin, scrawny children with shrivelled skin, spasmodic twitchings, sudden cries, feverishness."
Purpura hoemorrhagica. Paralysis of the extremities. Spinal irritation. Cachectic females with rough skin, pustules tending to gangrene.

The chest symptoms and expectoration are like Argentum met., Stannum. Its constipation is much like Alumen and Alumina. It should be carefully compared with these remedies.
Senecio Aureus
In some parts of the country where it grows it is called Golden Ragwort, in others Huckleroot.
It is an old domestic remedy and one only proved in a fragmentary way. Many of these medicines that have become household remedies should be properly proved. Only in this way can their power and influence be known, i. e., they can be used properly only when indicated by the symptoms they can produce.
Women: Senecio, is to be studied in relation to young girls with menstrual irregularities.
Those who have suppression of the menstrual flow from getting wet, from getting the feet wet, those who have menorrhagia, a copious menstrual flow which continues until they are anemic; and those also who suffer from dysmenorrheea, the pains being most violent. In this remedy, with these general features, the young girl gradually tends toward catarrhal phthisis.
The menstrual flow is suppressed sometimes many months, she begins to look pale, has a dry, hacking cough, with bleeding from the lungs instead of the menstrual flow, a vicarious spitting of blood.
There is a catarrhal state throughout the chest. They are pallid and weakly girls. They tell you they have lost their menstrual flow, and have a chronic cough, are sensitive to every draft of air, are always taking cold and finally expectorate profusely.
The phthisis may go on as catarrh of the chest for years, but at last a miliary tuberculosis sets in and takes the patient off with what is known as acute consumption. Especially is this condition associated with disorder of the menstrual flow and a general catarrhal state.
"Phthisis, with obstructed menstruation."
When the symptoms agree in this kind of a case Senecio is a most useful medicine for establishing the menstrual flow. You will know that it is acting well by the fact that the cough gradually diminishes. Of course a great many medicines will be suited to such general states, but this one has an unusually marked and special relation to these cases. In certain regions, Senecio has been used as a domestic medicine, an old woman's remedy for bringing on the menstrual flow.
You will be struck on reading over this remedy with the tendency to hemorrhage from all the mucous membranes of the body. There is coryza with nose-bleed; spitting of blood from the throat and chest; hemorrhage from the lungs; a catarrhal condition of all the mucous membranes with a tendency to haemorrhage: congestion and inflammation of the kidneys with haemorrhage.
You know how commonly these cases end in dropsy. These waxy, anaemic, chlorotic girls, who have lost their menstrual flow, become dropsical after slow hemorrhage from the uterus, kidneys and bladder.
"Dropsy from anaemia." It is a medicine of the highest order for hemorrhages in catarrhal conditions. Urinary: It has also in its proving many distressing symptoms of the urinary organs.
Painful urination. Uncomfortable heat in the neck of the bladder. Renal colic, the pains being so great that they produce nausea.
Renal dropsy. Intense pain over right kidney, etc. The whole urinary tract is painful and subject to bleeding. But bleeding especially in the absence of the menstrual flow is the feature of this remedy.
Wherever there is an inflammatory spot or catarrhal condition of the mucous membrane it will bleed in case the menstrual flow does not appear.
We have other medicines having the symptoms of vicarious haemorrhage, such as Hamamelis, Phosphorus and Bryonia, but Senecio has this condition strikingly and is one of the newer remedies for such condition.
"Dysmenorrhoea with urinary symptoms; cutting in sacral and hypogastric regions." "Hacking cough at night."
"Amenorrhoea from a cold; nervous irritability; lassitude; dropsy."
"Menstrual irregularities in consumptive patients."
"Mucous rattling with suppressed cough."
Leucorrhoea especially in chlorotic girls. It is a marked remedy in chlorosis, in the anemic state with a green hue, called "green sickness" by the laity.
Senega
Senega is an old lung tonic, and I suspect it has been an ingredient in most of the lung medicines for the last one hundred years.
It has been only partially proved, and needs further proving to bring out its particulars. When a medicine has been fully proved, it can be said of it that its symptoms are so well known that they can be examined as an image, i. e., the drug has affected all portions of man in such a manner as to stamp itself upon all of his natural actions and functions in a way peculiar to itself. This remedy has done some wonderful things, and these results in many instances can be only attributed to mere guesswork. This is about all that can be said in favor of careless and loose. prescribing.
Chest: Senega is more especially a chest medicine. It is full of chest symptoms and its relation to the air passages makes it worthy of consideration, although many of the individualizing symptoms have not yet been brought out.
From its most striking action on the mucous membrane of the air passages, its chief use has been in chest complaints, asthmatic complaints, in various forms of dyspnoea, cardiac and asthmatic. There are violent pains in the chest, especially like those of pleurisy. It has also symptoms like pneumonia; one of its most useful spheres is in pleuro-pneumonia. The pleuro-pneumonia of cattle has almost found its specific in Senega.
The finding of specifics is more likely to be true of animals than of human beings, as a remedy that is only partially indicated - may cure an animal, but it requires much finer discrimination among remedies in dealing with human beings.
A violent attack of pleurisy associated with pneumonia, too deep and too vicious for Bryonia, often finds its remedy in Senega. Senega is a sort of cross between Bryonia and Rhus tox. The violent symptoms are those of Bryonia, yet it is worse from rest, unlike Bryonia. The symptoms of Senega are not so much like Rhus tox., but it has an amelioration like that of Rhus tox., better from motion, the pains being worse when at rest.
The chest pains, rheumatic pains and inflammatory pains are worse during rest, but the cough is made worse from motion and the asthmatic troubles are made worse from the slightest motion. The Senega patient cannot walk up hill; he cannot walk against the wind, because it brings on chest symptoms and dyspnoea.
The rattling in the chest is as marked as in Antimonium tartaricum the tenacious mucus is as copious, as gluey and stringy as in Kali bichromicum, so much is this the case that he can get it only part way up, and with a spasmodic effort he swallows it, like Spongia and Causticum.
Senega is a remedy of deep action, as well as an acute remedy. It is filled with sharp and acute sufferings, sufferings that come on with rapidity, from taking cold, or from a cold that involves the whole chest.
Eyes: There are some eye symptoms in the text that are worthy of attention. "Paralysis of the muscles of the eyes."
"Iritis and specks upon the cornea."
"Paresis of the superior oblique."
"Aching over the orbits."
"Eyes pain as if pressed out."
"Blepharitis."
It has cured opacity of the vitreous humor.
Larynx: Of the larynx the text says,
"Aphonia from severe cold or excessive use of the voice."
"Constant tickling and burning in the larynx, leaving the patient not a moment's rest and preventing him from lying down; fear of suffocation."
When Senega is indicated there is a dryness in the mouth and throat, and the cough is incessant; there is a constant metallic coppery taste in the mouth and throat, as if he were coughing up pulverized copper.
Mouth: A very little of this medicine in proving will produce such a dryness and metallic taste in the mouth, and such a tickling at the root of the tongue, the pharynx and larynx, and it will finally end ina copious, thick, gluey discharge.
"Grippe, with stitches in right eye when coughing."
"Laryngeal phthisis."
"Copious accumulation of tough mucus in air-tubes, which causes the greatest often ineffectual, efforts at coughing and hawking for its expulsion."
This thick, tough mucus will lead most routine prescribers to give such medicines as Kali bichromicum, Lachesis and Mercurius corrosivus, entirely overlooking the usefulness of Senega.
It is a remedy of very wide range in complaints of the chest, larynx and trachea, in the severe "colds" that settle in these parts, especially when associated with tenacious mucus, so tenacious that he cannot cough it up; it seems at times that he will strangle; he will cough and vomit in the effort to expel the mucus, but it seems to disappear and he does not know where it goes.
"Sensation as if the chest were too narrow.”
"Most violent suffocation with asthma.”
"Short breathing and oppression of chest when going up stairs."
"Dyspnoea especially during rest."
"Dry cough with aphonia; worse in cold air and from walking,” is like Phosphorus and Rumex.
Those two remedies cause a cough, which commences when he first goes into the air. Senega, has another feature like Phosphorus, in that the cough is so violent that it makes him shake from head to foot; it brings on a tremulous feeling all over the body. He coughs from inhaling cold air; the cough is violent and the expectoration most difficult. In old, chronic catarrh of the chest for the earlier stages of which Bryonia was the most similar remedy, with this thick, tough, ropy mucus,
Senega is most suitable, and even when the patient is in the last stages of consumption. The symptoms become most troublesome, the gagging and coughing and effort to expectorate because of the thick, ropy mucus, are very distressing.
He breaks out in a cold sweat, especially on the upper part of the body. The chest is full of coarse rales from the tough mucus which he cannot expectorate. We think in such a case of remedies like Antimonium tartaricum, Pyrogen, Kali bichromicum, etc., but this remedy is just as suitable, especially when there is a great amount of dryness in the throat and larynx, dryness in the throat during sleep and observed on waking, and inability to expectorate the tough ropy mucus.
"Shaking cough,” i. e., the cough is so violent that it shakes the whole frame.
The concussion from the cough causes discharge of urine involuntarily and causes violent pains in the head and over the eyes. Senega, is called for especially in those cases where the pleura has been involved at one stage or the other.
The pains are increased and it seems as if the chest would be torn on coughing. "Walls of the chest sensitive or painful when touched."
"Profuse secretion of mucus in lungs of old people."
Senega is one of the leading remedies for the tough mucus and coarse rales in old people without any other symptoms. It very often clears the throat and helps to patch up an old man when he is breaking down.
"Great rattling of mucus in chest and flying pains in chest-"
It has sometimes cured pleuro-pneumonia when there was the extreme exhaustion of Phosphorus and Arsenicum. In such cases Senega has caused reaction; it has such weakness. Especially is it suited in the advanced cases of phthisis, when those symptoms that I have mentioned are present.
It acts as a palliative. It does excellent patch work without serious aggravations, as it relates more especially to superficial conditions. It is not as deep acting as Sulphur and Silicea. We give such remedies only when we have a reasonable assurance that we can cure, when the patient is yet curable.
But when we have given up all hope, then we pay more attention to the most painful parts; we pay more attention to the local symptoms, to the group which causes the most suffering and attempt to do patch work.
If the sufferings in the chest and the exhaustion become most severe it is true that Arsenicum will patch him up a little and make him feel more like life, and he will go on to the end with more comfort. If the pains in the chest are most severe such medicines as Senega or Bryonia will help him; if he is sore and feels as if bruised and he most move from side to side Arnica will relieve; but these are not the remedies to go deep into the life and eradicate a deep-seated disease like phthisis.
Yet with these one may take a consumptive patient in comfort to the very grave, by simply patching him up and prescribing for his immediate sufferings. Homoeopathic remedies give these incurable sufferers much greater comfort than sprays and anodynes.
The pains of the chest are worse during rest and on inspiring. Stitching pains in the chest when lying on the right side. Great soreness in the walls of the chest. Pain under right scapula when coughing. The chest pains are better while walking in the open air.
Sepia
Sepia is suited to tall, slim women with narrow pelvis and lax fibers and muscles; such a woman is not well built as a woman.
A woman who has the hips of a well-built man is not built for child bearing, she cannot perform the functions of a woman without becoming relaxed in the pelvic organs and tissues. Such a build is a Sepia build, very tall, slim, narrow, straight from the shoulders all the way down.
Mind: One of the strongest features of the Sepia patient is found in the mind, the state of the affections. To a great extent, the remedy seems to abolish the ability to feel natural love, to be affectionate. To illustrate it in the language of the mother:
"I know I ought to love my children and my husband, I used to love them, but now I have no feeling on the subject."
The love does not go forth into affection, there is a lack of realization, a lack of ability to register such affections; the love does not manifest itself. Upon reflection it will be seen that the love itself cannot be so changed, but the affections can be as they are the expression of the love.
It is a striking feature of this remedy that the affections are stilled; all things seem strange; she does not realize; she may even be estranged and turned aside from those she loves. This is on the border land of insanity; it is quite a different state of affairs from that when a woman abused by her husband knows in her rational mind that she does not love him.
This state is brought out in a woman during confinement, after uterine and other hemorrhages, after prolonged indigestion; high living with disturbance in the circulation, pallor, enfeeblement of body and mind. It is seldom manifested in a man, but it is a striking feature in the woman. It often comes on when nursing a child, from nursing an over-vigorous child or twins who require much lacteal fluid and drag her down. It may be brought out in a woman who has an overvigorous husband. Excessive sexual excitement and over-indulgence brings on coldness and she becomes a cold woman.
She who has been excitable, nervous, and fidgety becomes the opposite, cold, takes on a stoical state of mind. Yet Sepia has all the excitability of any medicine, aggravated by noises, excitement, company, extreme irritability of tissue and mind; an excitable suicidal patient; melancholy, sits and says nothing; taciturn; answers questions in monosyllables when pressed to answer.
An absence of all joy, inability to realize that things are real; all things seem strange; no affection for the delightful things of life; no joy; life has nothing in it for her. She is worse in company yet dreads to be alone; and when she is in company she is spiteful, in the midst of her dullness of mind she is spiteful; she vents her spite on those she loves best. The Sepia woman permits no opposition to her opinions. The best impression of her is lost if controversy arises.
Skin: The next most general state is a peculiar sallowness which you will need to see to fix in your mind.
Sepia has jaundice, yet this peculiar sallowness is a waxy, anaemic appearance, mottled with yellow, a yellow, sallow tint across the nose and the cheeks described as a yellow saddle across the nose and down the sides of the face.
It is also common for the whole face to be covered with enormous freckles, great brown patches as in pregnancy, brown spots on the cheeks, brown warts, warts that have been red or pink become pigmented; liver spots on the face, chest, and abdomen.
The skin of the face is sallow and doughy, looks as if the muscles were flabby; you will seldom see Sepia indicated in the face that shows sharp lines of intellect; a person who has been thinking a long time has the lines and sharp angles of a thinking person, of one who possesses will and intellect. The Sepia subject is one who is rather stupid and dull, thinks slowly and is forgetful; the mind is anything but active and we see it in the face.
Face: In many instances, however, the Sepia patient is a quick patient, but the dullness of intellect is the most striking feature and it reflects itself upon the face.
The face is generally puffed, often smooth and rounded and marked by an absence of intellectual lines and angles.
This patient is anemic, pale lips and ears, pale, sallow face, fingers and hands become shrivelled, sallow, waxy, bloodless. Sepia establishes a progressing emaciation of the body and the skin becomes wrinkled; the
person looks prematurely old; wrinkles intermingled with sallow spots on the face in one who is 35 years of age, making him look as if he were fifty. A child looks like a shrivelled dried up old person.
Bowels: With all complaints there is constipation.
The bowels lose their ability to expel their contents and the patient is always constipated; constipation during pregnancy; slow, difficult stool; stool like sheep dung. Always has a feeling of a lump in the rectum, never able to empty the bowels; though he goes to stool there is always a sensation of a lump remaining in the rectum. When the stool passes into the lower bowel, it is not expelled until there is an accumulation, which presses the stool out.
Hunger: Another feature present in most Sepia patients is a gnawing hunger, seldom satisfied; even though he eats plentifully he feels a gnawing, empty, hungry feeling in the stomach, not relieved by eating or relieved only for a moment. This is striking especially when associated with the constipation and the peculiar state of the affections.
When these symptoms are associated with prolapsus, Sepia will certainly cure, no matter how bad the prolapsus has been or what kind of displacement there is. It is the result of the state of relaxation of all the internal parts as if they were let down, wants a bandage to hold the parts up or wants to place the hand or napkin on the parts; a funneling sensation, better sitting down and crossing the limbs.
When these symptoms group themselves together, the gnawing hunger, the constipation, the dragging down, and the mental condition, it is Sepia and Sepia only. One is not sufficient but it is the combination.
Sepia has a marked catarrhal tendency, tendency to milky discharges from mucous membranes. Long after digestion has ceased and the stomach is empty comes nausea and sometimes vomiting.
It is a catarrhal state of the stomach and when it persists with the milky vomiting, Sepia is very valuable. This is not an uncommon feature in the vomiting of pregnancy. Vomits up food and after emptying the stomach of its contents, vomits or eructates a milky fluid; morning vomiting, first of food, then a milky substance. Do not confound this with vomiting of milk. Some medicines vomit milk alone and Sepia does this also.
Whitish, milky discharges from the posterior nares, from the vagina, excoriating, milky leucorrhea, which at times takes on the appearance of curds, thick, cheesy, and horribly offensive; it has also thick, green and yellow discharges; it has dry crusty formations on mucous membranes.
Nose: Prolonged inveterate catarrh of the nose, thick, green, and yellow crusts are blown from the nose and sometimes are hawked from the posterior nares, thick, leathery formations.
Loss of taste and smell. The smell of cooking food, meat and broth causes nausea. Catarrh of the chest with thick, tenacious, yellow expectoration, accompanied with a violent cough, retching, gagging, violent prolonged retching, vomiting; dry cough and yet there is rattling. Whooping cough; asthmatic cough with retching and loss of urine.
Cough: The cough is a violent one.
Cough during first sleep (Lach., in irritable children Cham.). Tuberculosis. Quick consumption after a suppressed gonorrhea; if given soon enough it will check. Spasmodic dry cough in the evening until midnight; holds the chest during the cough (Bry., Natr. sulph., Phos.)
Skin: Eruptions of the skin.
Tendency to produce herpetic eruptions about the genitals, lips and mouth; ring-worm upon the face and body. It has cured zona, and herpetic eruptions of the labia and foreskin. Vesicular eruptions in the axilla, upon the tip-s of the elbows; eruptions that pile up in great crusts on the elbows; thick crusts form upon the joints; eruptions between the fingers; moist eruptions that pour out a watery fluid, or thick, yellow, purulent fluid.
Sepia produces the induration that belongs to some forms of eruption like epithelioma; indurations will form on the lips and crack and bleed. The scaly eruption that looks like epithelioma is especially Sepia. When the scales come off a yellow, green, ichorous base remains, and as soon as one crust peels off, another forms; finally if torn off prematurely, it bleeds. Sepia has cured epithelioma of the lips, wings of the nose, and eyelids It has cured old indurations caused by the use of a clay pipe, where it continues to form, and beneath it is seen this thick, yellow, purulent exudation.
It is indicated in lumps and lupoid formation on the skin, where there is infiltration; sometimes healing from the centre to form a ring; this is a typical Sepia condition. The hardness and purple color are what are peculiarly Sepia. Sepia stands on a par with Lach. for this purple aspect.
Mind again: Sepia has a hysterical diathesis.
Breaks out in spells of weeping, is sad one minute, gentle, yielding, and in another she is disagreeable, excitable, obstinate. You do not know what she is going to do next. She says and does strange things, makes errors, no dependence can be placed on her; no mental endurance; no affection for her family; whole Mind
weak and disordered, not when there is fever, but it is a chronic manifestation of psora or sycosis.
Fear of ghosts; that something unusual will happen; atmosphere full of figures, not seen, but she knows that they are there; departed friends or other forms and very often in accordance with religions belief.
Never happy unless annoying some one; relating her grievances; sarcastic; insulting fear of insanity, poverty.
"Fears to starve, is peevish and feels mortified, easily frightened and full of forbodings."
"Passionate, irritable; the greatest irritability from slight causes, very easily offended.
Vexed and disposed to scold."
Head: The headaches are nervous, bilious, periodic, violent, involving the whole head; congestive. Generally better lying down, keeping perfectly quiet; worse from ordinary motion, but relieved by violent motion, like most Sepia symptoms in general; she can walk off her sufferings. Stasis of the brain, slowness
of thought, mind will not work and, mental labor aggravates the headache. A good substantial sleep relieves it, but if she is awakened after sleeping a short time, the headache is worse.
The same is seen in regard to motion; moving the eyes, head, or body, moving about in a warm room aggravates the pain, but a good, long walk in the open air until she becomes heated up, relieves. It is a sluggish state of the body which requires exercise, and violent exercise to keep it in a state of comfort.
The Sepia symptoms are worse in the open air unless combined with continued motion, better from exercise in the open air and worse in the house. The headache is worse from stooping, motion, coughing, going up stairs, jarring, light, turning the head, lying on the back and from thinking, but continued, hard exercise relieves, as does a tight bandage, and the application of heat, though worse in a warm room.
There are Sepia headaches that particularly affect the occiput, worse in the morning; great pain through the eyes and temples; relieved by sweat, worse on beginning to move; throbbing felt on stooping, worse on going up s airs.
The Phos. headache is relieved by sleep, but continued, rapid motion aggravates. Cannot endure it. Sepia is suited to the old fashioned bilious headaches. It is better from vomiting; the pain gradually increases, loathing of food, then nausea, vomiting and the patient falls asleep and wakens without the headache. Sang. resembles it, is better vomiting, better in a dark room; the direction is different, however.
Neuralgia of the head; periodic sick-headaches in gouty people; violent, congestive headaches in young women sensitive to noise, women of extremely delicate fiber, especially those with dark eyes, dark skin, and who become sallow from sickness. Jaundice often sets in with the headaches; at the close of the headache vomiting, and in a few days jaundice, which passes away but returns again with the next headache.
Headache every morning with nausea; the smell of food repulsive. Sepia takes on a stupid state of mind as mentioned above; will not work; will not answer questions; as if intoxicated, benumbed; eyes and face swollen, sclerotics yellow and jaundice.
This sometimes ends in violent vomiting spells. Craves spicy, pungent, bitter things like beer - in old drunkards with headache; threatening apoplexy.
"Apoplexy in men addicted to drinking and sexual excesses, with a disposition to gout and hemorrhoids, etc."
"Threatening apoplexy in a dissipated, middle-aged man, who is subject to arthritic and hoemorrhoidal complaints; they have usually passed through several light attacks of apoplexy and are frequently visited with prodromic symptoms!"
Under external head we have eruptions and falling out of the hair yellow crusts; oozing of pus and other fluids; vesicles eczema of infants.
Face: Eyes; catarrhal symptoms with vesicles and pustules granular lids ulcers and psoric manifestations; various infiltrative conditions of the eyes and about the eyes; pustules on the margins of the lids, pustules on the globe of the eye, seems as if looking through a gauze; tarsal tumors, agglutination of lids, styes, etc.
The ears discharge thick, yellow pus; offensive.
The nose is a favorite locality; loss of smell; yellow or green thick crusts fill the nose and cannot be blown out; inveterate discharge of thick yellow pus.
"Large offensive-smelling plugs from the nose, often so large that they have to be drawn back into the mouth and expectorated, causing vomiting.
Dry coryza especially of left nostril, following of large lumps of yellow or green mucus or yellow-green crusts with blood from the nose."
This is descriptive of the worst forms of catarrh; very few will let it run on thus far, they apply local treatment and heal the nose up, and, the process at once going to the chest, phthisis pituitosa comes on.
The gums settle away from the teeth. Toothache and neuralgia from taking cold.
Sensation of a lump in the throat (like Lach.), but the latter is better from swallowing. (The same in worm troubles indicates Cina.) Uneasiness of the collar and corsets like Lach. Worse in the first, sleep like Lach.
Stomach: Sepia brings out many things in connection with the appetites, thirst, eating, drinking and stomach, etc.
The Sepia patient is generally conscious of a spoiled stomach, sour and bitter eructations of food, of mucus and bile, sour and bitter vomiting of food and mucus; all-gone, hungry, empty feeling in the stomach sometimes not relieved by eating.
At times a gnawing pain, a sinking, a gnawing hunger which is not always relieved by eating. Almost constant nausea, especially in the morning, nausea and eructations and vomiting of milky fluid; when the stomach is empty, vomiting, spitting up, eructations of milky fluid.
Aversion to food, to the smell of food cooking, like Colch. and Ars. The patient gets up in the morning with an all-gone feeling, distress and fullness in the stomach followed by belching and uprisings of mucus, and milky fluids; vomiting of pregnancy; vomiting of milky water in the morning; this is a characteristic of
Sepia.
Acrid, burning eructations; heartburn; rancid eructations, excoriating the throat; pyrosis which is another form of eructation; acrid, sour fluids burning all the way up, causing contraction, tingling, smarting.
Nausea violent; deathly sinking accompanied with an awful anxiety in the stomach.
Phos. has more of the typical hunger which is relieved by eating. The Jgnatia patient is always sighing; cannot get rid of "that feeling."
Oleander has an all-gone empty feeling as if he would die; food does not relieve, is not digested, but panes undigested the next day.
Lyc. has an all-gone feeling sometimes not better by eating, felt as markedly before as after eating, and after eating there comes a throbbing.
Kali carb. has it also, without the amelioration from taking food; it is even intensified by eating, which is followed by a sensation of fullness and throbbing.
In severe liver and heart affections the stomach is not able to keep up assimilation; palpitation, great weakness, liver congested, white stool.
Digitalis comes in here with its deathly sinking not better by vomiting. In Sepia this symptom is associated with the loss of affections, the lump in the rectum, with the constipation, etc.
"Pain in the stomach after the simplest food.
Stitches and burning in the stomach.
Pain in the stomach worse by vomiting." This is peculiar, for vomiting usually relieves the distress. The Sepia stomach becomes like a leather bag, fill
it up and the food comes up just as eaten or at times sour or mixed with bile. Inflammation of the liver, enlargement with jaundice, pain, fullness, distension, distress in the region of the liver.
Abdomen: distended with flatus, rumbling and distension. These disturbances are often chronic as in pot- bellied mothers; abdomen covered with brown spots. Sepia has removed tape-worm.
Chronic diarrhea, stools jelly-like, lumpy; alternating diarrhoea and constipation; a great amount of mucus with the stools, whether constipated or diarrheic; hard stool covered with a great quantity of jellylike mucus.
Goes for days without a stool and then sits and strains until a copious sweat breaks out and yet no stool, but after assistance with the finger and prolonged strain a little stool is passed, followed by a cupful of jelly-like
mucus, yellow or yellow-white and very offensive.
The acute diarrheas and dysenteries with jelly-like stools are more in keeping with Kali bi. and Colch. This is chronic diarrhoea or in constipation with stool covered with or followed by jelly-like mucus is Sepia.
Do not confound with Graph., which has an enormous stool with much straining and sweating, and coated with and mixed with a substance looking like the cooked white egg, as if covered with albumen.
In Sepia there is much offensiveness; the odor of the stool is unusual, loose stools horribly offensive, foetid; the sweat is foetid, the urine is foetid.
"The stool has a putrid, sourish, foetid smell, expelled suddenly and the whole of it at once."
Sepia is given in a routine way for constipation, when there are few symptoms.
Rectum: There is always a sense of fullness in the rectum after stool; ineffectual straining and sweating in the effort because the patient is weak and exhausted.
Sepia has the ineffectual urging like Nux. She may go for days with no urging and then the effort is as if she were in labor. Prolapse of the rectum. Weight as of a ball in the anus not relieved by stool.
Soreness of the anus. Expulsion of ascarides. Oozing moisture from the rectum, soreness between the buttocks.
Hemorrhoids soon form when the rectum is so packed with feces, and they give additional trouble. Urinary: There is much urinary trouble; involuntary urination as soon as the child goes to sleep at night.
Sepia is compelled to keep the mind on the neck of the bladder or she will lose the urine; urine is lost when coughing, sneezing, laughing, the slam of a door, a shock, or when the mind is diverted.
Frequent, constant urging to urinate with milky urine that burns like fire and after standing a while a milky, grayish deposit will form which is hard to wash off the vessel. Bloody urine scanty and suppressed, great pain in the kidneys and bladder with great bearing down; sudden desire with tenesmus as if the uterus
would come out. Sudden desire to urinate with cutting like knives and chill all over the body, if unable to pass it, as a lady in company.
I remember a pitiable case. A saleswoman was obliged to go to the closet every few minutes; a violent pain like a knife cutting came with the desire to urinate, and if the urine was not passed this pain would hold right on. She was compelled to keep her mind on the urine or she would lose it. She was tall, slim, with sallow face, distressed look, worn and tired. Sepia cured her and she was never troubled again.
The Sepia patient aborts at the third month. All sorts of ulcerative conditions, displacements, dragging down and relaxations. Retained Placenta. Sub involution, all the pelvic organs are tired and weak. Metrorrhagia during the climacteric or during pregnancy, especially at the fifth and seventh months.
Genitals: Both male and female have aversion to the opposite sex.
In the female there is a state as if she had indulged to excess, when this is not the case. No endurance, tired after coition, sleepless nights, sleep full of dreams, jerking of muscles, twitching, leucorrhoea, congestion of the pelvis.
A woman who has been normal in her relations with her husband brings forth a child, and then the thought of sexual relations causes nausea and irritability.
The menstrual symptoms are of all sorts, no particular derangement characterizes Sepia. At one time it was thought that scanty menstruation was the more striking feature, but this is not necessarily so; from provings and clinical observations, it has cured profuse as well as scanty flow. Most violent dysmenorrhoea in girls of delicate fiber, sallow girls.
Sepia comes in when the woman ought to menstruate when the child ceases to nurse; sometimes the child dies and menses ought to be established but do not appear, and the mother runs down, pines away; Sepia will establish the flow.
Calc. is the opposite; the menses come on while the child is nursing. Thick greenish acrid or milky leucorrhea. Leucorrhoea in little girls.
In the male, old sycotic discharge that has resisted injection. Profuse yellow, or milky discharge from the urethra, or the "last drop" painless.
Gonorrhea after the acute symptoms have subsided. Urine loaded with urates, stains everything red and often excoriates, very foetid, associated with prostatitis.
"Gleet; no pain; discharge only during the night, a drop or so staining the linen yellowish; yellowish discharge, no burning or urinating; painless; of a year and a half's standing; orifice of urethra stuck together in the morning, particularly when the sexual organs are debilitated by long continuance of disease or through frequent seminal emissions.”
Warts on the genitals; Sepia is useful when these organs have been overused and take on such an appearance. Impotence in the male, loss of sexual feeling in the female.
The close relation between this remedy and Murex is worth considering. The muscular relaxation, dragging down in the abdomen and pelvis, aggravated from exertion and walking, ameliorated by sitting with the
limbs crossed and ameliorated by pressure on the genitalia would be like both remedies; but add to this copious menstrual flow and violent sexual desire and Murex must be considered and Sepia eliminated.
Both have extreme empty feeling in the stomach. Sepia has diminished sexual desire and often aversion. Murex has great soreness and congestion of the uterus, and she is constantly reminded of the uterus. Murex has acute pain in right side of uterus which crosses the body diagonally upward to left side of chest, or left breast, It cures violent dysmenorrhoea. It has been useful in cancer of the -uterus. Watery, greenish, thick, bloody leucorrhea, causing itching.
Back: One of Sepia's most general characteristics is the amelioration from violent exercise; worse on beginning to move but better by getting warmed up. This condition is closely related to the back symptoms. There is a great amount of soreness in the back, the spine aches all the way down. Pressure on the spine reveals sore places, spinal irritation.
Aching in the back mostly from the loins to the coccyx, often coming on from sitting, and ameliorated from violent exercise. A peculiar feature is amelioration from hard pressure. The patient commonly puts a book low down on the chair and presses the back against it. Sepia does not seem to get the amelioration from lying upon the back as Natrum mur. does. Stooping aggravates the backache.
"Backache worse from kneeling." Under symptoms of the lower extremities we find great numbness of the feet.
"Coldness of the legs and feet especially in the evening in bed when the feet get warm the hands get cold; icy coldness of the feet profuse sweat of the feet or sweat of unbearable odor causing. soreness between the toes. Swelling of the limbs better while walking."
The sleep is full of dreams and distress; cannot sleep upon the left side because of palpitation of the heart. Palpitation in sleep, with pulsations and trembling all over the body, pulsations to the finger tips.
In old cases of suppressed malaria, Sepia brings back the chill, but its most useful sphere is after a bad selection of the remedy and the case becomes confused. Where a remedy has been selected for only a part of the case and changed it a little but the patient gets no better.
It will be seen that the fever, chill, and sweat are just as erratic as can be. Natrum mur. is one of the greatest malarial remedies, but it is full of order like China, Sepia is full of disorder.
Ina case confused by remedies think of Calc., Ars., Sulph., Sepia and Ipecac. Never give China or Natrum mur. for irregular symptoms and stages.
Sepia is complementary to Natrum mur. Aside from the stupid condition of the mind it has an excitable condition of the general nervous system that is often marked in Natrum mur. as, for instance, being disturbed by a noise, the slam of a door, etc. It produces jerking of the muscles in sleep; constantly wakes from imaginary noises, thinks someone has called her; the last disturbance about the house wakens her.
Worse before and during menses; during pregnancy; after eating during first sleep; change of weather; during a thunderstorm; overwhelming fear.
Silicea
The action of Silica is slow. In the proving, it takes a long time to develop the symptoms. It is, therefore, suited to complaints that develop slowly.
Generalities: At certain times of the year and under certain circumstances peculiar symptoms will come out.
They may stay with the prover the balance of his life. Such are the long-acting, deep-acting remedies; they are capable of going so thoroughly into the vital order that hereditary disturbances are routed out. The Silica patient is chilly; his symptoms are developed in cold, damp weather, though often better in cold, dry weather; symptoms come out after a bath.
Mind: The mental state is peculiar.
The patient lacks stamina. What Silica is to the stalk of, grain in the field, it is to the human mind. Take the glossy, stiff, outer covering of a stalk of grain and examine it, and you will realize with what firmness it supports the head of grain until it ripens; there is a gradual deposit of Silica in it to give it stamina. So it is with the mind; when the mind needs Silica it is in a state of weakness, embarrassment, dread, a state of yielding.
If you should listen to the description of this state by a prominent clergyman, or a lawyer, or a man in the habit of appearing in public with self-confidence, firmness and fullness of thought and speech, he would tell you he had come to a state where he dreads to appear in public, he feels his own selfhood so that he cannot enter into his subject, he dreads it, he fears that he will fail, his mind will not work, he is worn out by prolonged efforts at mental work.
But he will say that when he forces himself into the harness he can go on with ease, his usual self-command returns to him and he does well; he does his work with promptness, fullness, and accuracy. The peculiar Silica state is found in the dread of failure.
If he has any unusual mental task to perform, he fears he will make a failure of it, yet he does it well. This is the early state; of course there comes a time when he cannot perform the work with accuracy and still he may need Silica.
Another case is illustrated in a young man who has studied for years and is now nearing the end of his course. He dreads the final examinations but he goes through them all right, then a fatigue comes upon him and for years he is unable to enter his profession. He has this dread of undertaking anything.
Irritable and irascible when aroused; when let alone he is timid, retiring, wants to shirk everything; mild, gentle tearful women. The Silica child is cross and cries when spoken to. It is the natural complement and chronic of Puls. because of its great similarity; it is a deeper, more profound remedy.
Religious melancholy, sadness, irritability, despondency. Lyc. is stupid, the dread of undertaking any thing in from a general knowledge of inability. In Silica it is imaginary.
Silica is not suitable for the irritability and nervous exhaustion coming on from business brain-fag, but more for such brain-fag as belongs to professional men, students, lawyers, clergymen. A lawyer says,
"I have never been myself since that John Doe case"
He went through a prolonged effort and sleepless nights followed. Silica restores the brain. Skin: The remedy produces inflammation about any fibrinous nidus and suppurates it out.
It acts upon constitutions that are sluggish and inflames fibrous deposits about old imbedded missiles. Slow nutrition; if the individual receives a slight injury it suppurates and the cicatrix indurates, is hard and nodular.
Along the track of a knife-cut, is a fibrinous deposit due to inferior and slow nutrition. An old ulcer heals with induration. Where cicatricial tissue forms, it is indurated, shiny, glassy. If Silica is given in such cases, it will throw out abscesses in these cicatrices and open them out. It will open up old ulcers and heal them with a normal cicatrix.
In ordinary people if a splinter lodges in the tissues, a suppuration will slough it out, but in these feeble constitutions a plastic deposit takes place about it and it remains. This is not the highest state of order. Suppuration takes place about a bullet and pushes it out, that is the best state that can be asked for.
Silica, therefore, hastens the formation of abscesses and boils. It suppurates out old wens and indurated tumors. It has cured recurrent fibroids and old indurated tumors.
It there is a deposit of tubercle in the lungs, Silica establishes ail inflammation and throws it out, and if the whole lung be tubercular a general suppurative pneumonia will be the result; hence, the danger of giving such remedies and the danger of repeating them in advanced stage of phthisis. Not only Silica but many other remedies have the power to suppurate out deposits, the result of poor nutrition.
Warty growths on the skin, moist eruptions, pimples, pustules, abscesses. Suppurating cavities. It establishes healing in old fistulous openings with indurated margins. Catarrhal suppurations; copious muco-purulent discharge from the eyes, nose, ears, chest, vagina, etc.
Suppression: Complaints from the suppression of discharges; suppressed sweat.
These suppressions produce a state in the economy that threatens what little order is left. An offensive foot- sweat ceases after getting the feet wet, and is followed by chills and violent complaints.
Silica cures long lasting foot-sweat when the symptoms agree, or complaints that have lasted since the suppression of a foot-sweat. Thick, yellow catarrhal discharges.
They say,
"I have had this discharge so many years," and when you investigate, you find that there has been some, shock, a cold, that suppressed the foot-sweat and it has not appeared since. Silica will bring back that sweat, cause the catarrhal discharge to cease and in time cure the foot-sweat.
Catarrhal discharges from the nose and other places, indurations, tumors, chronic gastritis, brain- fag, all dating back to the suppression of foot-sweat or otorrheoa, or to the healing up of a fistula.
Head: Chronic sick-headache attended with nausea and even vomiting.
Headache commencing in the back of the head in the morning or towards noon going to the forehead, worse towards night, from noise; better from heat; supra-orbital neuralgias; better from pressure and heat and attended with profuse head-sweat.
Cold, clammy, offensive sweat on the forehead. When a Silica patient exerts himself he sweats on the face, the lower part of the body is dry or nearly so. It requires great exertion to produce general sweat. A striking feature is the sweat about the upper parts of the body and the head.
Headache once a week (Gets., Lyc., Sang., Sulph.). Headache up through the back of the neck and especially to the right side of the head. Resembles Sang. Weight in the occiput as if it would be drawn back, with a rush of blood to the head, like Carbo veg. and Sepia.
Headache worse from cold air. Psor. wears a fur cap even in summer. Magn. mur. is better from wrapping up the head but still wants to be in the air. Rhus sweats on the body; the head is dry. Puls. sweats on one side of the head.
Vertigo to fainting; with nausea; vertigo creeping up the spine into the head.
It is especially necessary for the Silica patient to avoid the cold air, must have the head well wrapped up, especially the part that is painful, and this part perspires copiously.
"Headache worse from mental exertion, excessive study, noise, motion, even jarring from foot-steps, light, stooping, pressing at stool, talking, cold air, touch."
Skin again: Moist, scaly eruption on the scalp, eczema capitis.
Silica is suited to the phagedenic ulcers of syphilis, eating and spreading ulcers on the scalp. Inflammatory conditions between the scalp and skull, tumors forming, filled with a grumous fluid; as in infancy, it will remove blood tumors.
Cephalatoma neonatorum, enchondroses. Silica is especially of use in the treatment of affections of the cartilages, growths about the joints, about the fingers and toes.
The complaints of Silica are associated with hardened glands, but especially about the neck, the cervical, salivary, and particularly the parotid glands; large, hard parotids. The parotids enlarge from every cold and get hard. (Bar. carb., Calc., Sulph,)
Puls. suits the acute inflammation of the parotid, but Silica is indicated in the more chronic forms due to psora, "scrofulous glands."
Eyes: Many inflammations and conditions of the eyes.
Ulcers on the cornea; pustules on the lids, falling of the lashes, suppuration of the margins of the lids with burning, stinging and redness. Intense photophobia in all eye complaints.
Scrofulous cases with sore eyes, the most inveterate and chronic cases; suppuration; thin, watery, copious discharge, or bloody, thick and yellow like pus, with ulceration.
Syphilitic iritis.
"Perforating or sloughing ulcer on the cornea. Spots and cicatrices on the cornea. Fungus haematodes.
Eyes inflamed from traumatic causes; foreign particles have lodged in the eyes; abscesses; boils around the eyes and lids tarsal tumors, styes.
Affections appearing in the angles of the eyes fistula lachrymalis; stricture of lachrymal duct."
This is a general survey of the eye affections in Silica.
Ear: There is no deeper remedy than Silica in eradicating the tubercular tendency, when the symptoms agree; most tubercular cases are worse from cold, wet weather; better in cold dry weather.
The most inveterate cases of catarrh of the ear; old offensive, thick, yellow otorrheoa; following scarlet fever; all sorts of abnormalities in hearing, even to deafness.
Roaring in the cars associated with many diseases and hardness of hearing; hissing, roaring like steam; like a train of cars, many times from mechanical cause and other times from a condition of the nerves.
It is commonly the beginning of a dry catarrh of the middle ear; the remedy is especially useful when, in catarrh of the middle ear and Eustachian tube, the deafness goes on for some time and the hearing returns with a snap, due to the escape of the accumulation of fluids somewhere and described by the patient as a snap or report.
Sudden reports in the ear like a cannon, distant noises with return of hearing.
"Otorrheoa, offensive, watery, curdy, with soreness of inner nose and crusts on upper lip, after abuse of Mercury, with caries."
Caries of bone in any part of the body, but especially of the small bones of the car, nose and mastoid process,
"Scabs behind the cars."
Rupture of the drum of the ear.
Catarrhal conditions of the internal car and Eustachian tube, with "feeling of sudden stoppage in the ear, better by gaping or swallowing."
Especially with ear troubles, there will be associated indurated parotid glands.
Nose: Accumulation of hard crusts in the nose, loss of taste and smell epistaxis, thickening of the mucous membrane; most vicious catarrh with discharge of bone from the nose.
Horrible, foetid ozaena, old syphilitic cases where the nasal bones are destroyed and the nose becomes a flabby bag, is sunken in or ulcerated away, leaving an opening. Silica may cure and an artificial nose be made afterwards.
Hepar competes with Silica in syphilitic nasal catarrhs where the parts are phagedenic; Hepar, Merc. cor. and Ars., are the principal antisyphilitics when there is phagedenic ulceration of the nose. Babies suffer from bloody nasal discharge. This is often Calc. sul.
Face: The aspect of the Silica face is silky, anemic, waxy, tired. Pustular and vesicular eruptions spread over the face, the wings of the nose crack, the lips easily fissure; crusts form on the margin between the mucous membrane and the skin; eruptions and crusts, indurations form under the crusts, they peel off and there is no healing.
These indurations are the same kind of inferior tissue that is found under lupus and epithelioma, a low tissue formation, a low state of eczema that favors infiltration. The small blood-vessels that lead to them become thicker and thicker until they become gristly. There is a tendency to make the soft tissues harder and the hard tissues harder.
In childhood the bones become softer and even necrose or there is an inflammation of the periosteum and a consequent necrosis. Caries of the shaft of the long bones, the head of the bones and the cartilaginous portions; abscesses in cartilages, enchondromata.
Bones break down and form fistulous openings. Necrosis of the jaw, the joints, the hip-joint, the tibia, necrosis of the spine, of the vertebrae, so that there is curvature of the spine, lateral especially. The homoeopathic physicians may treat these affections of the bones with the help of accessory contrivances or supports.
The Silica patient has rough lips, they crack and peel; rhagades. Scaly appearances at the margins of the lips, fissures in the corners of the mouth that indurate. There is often a line of fissure about the margin of the crust. Little crusts like epithelioma form upon the wings of the nose and when picked off leave a raw surface with no tendency to heal.
Crusty formations upon the ears.
The teeth break down, lose their enamel surface; the dentine is made up largely of the silicate of lime and the surface of the tooth becomes rough, loses its shiny appearance and caries sets in.
This often takes place at the margin of the gum; ulcers form on the tip of the fangs. The teeth suffer when it is cold or damp; toothache in wet weather, and the teeth are yellow, decay rapidly, and the gums settle away from. them.
All the neuralgias and toothaches are better in a warm room and from hot drinks. Abscesses about the gums and face, better by warmth. Severe pain in the jaw, rending, tearing at night, better from heat; these pains often end in abscesses about the teeth. Sometimes relieved by pressure unless the part is extremely sore from inflammation.
The tongue takes on inflammation of gouty character; inflammation with threatening abscess, it fills the whole mouth; rending, tearing pains, worse at night and better from heat.
Throat: In the throat and neck we have inflammation and swelling of all the glands, external and internal, all at once or singly.
Quinsy with great pain in the tonsils, one or both; threatening suppuration. Inflammation of the parotid, sublingual and much less frequently the submaxillary and cervical glands; painful, tumid and hard, with pain in the neck, shoulders and head, even in acute inflammations. But then we have the opposite state of affairs. In an old chronic case broken down with suffering the symptoms are worse after a bath, he wants warmth, dread the cold, is always shivering.
But when in the neck there is an acute inflarnmation the very opposite is present; he suffers from flushes of heat, an irregular, flushing fever, cold extremities while the upper part of the body is hot, sweat about the head and neck, sensation of heat and suffocation in a warm room. This will be present in quinsy and abscesses of the glands of the neck, if acute. Silica here shows its relation to Puls. The latter in its chronic manifestations is overburdened with heat, but in an acute trouble is chilly. They are reversed as to their acute and chronic states. Puls, in the beginning is chilly and sweating.
Silica is full of throat symptoms but is seldom indicated in acute forms because its pace is too low; it comes on after there has been a series of colds, such colds as are ameliorated a number of times by Bell. or other acute remedies but still continue to settle in the tonsils and in the glands of the neck.
Silica breaks up the tendency. There is a catarrhal state in the throat that is roused up by every cold into an increased flux, with hoarseness, settling back into the chronic state again; chronic catarrhs of the pharynx.
It competes with Natrum mur. in inveterate sore throat. Stomach: Silica disturbs the stomach, causes hiccough, nausea and vomiting disturbs the liver.
All these symptoms are connected and are hard to separate. Decided aversion to warm food, desires cold things, wants his tea moderately cold, he is willing to have his food cold, dislikes warm food. Sometimes there is a decided aversion to meat, but if he does take it, he prefers cold, sliced meat. He likes ice cream, ice water, and feels comfortable when it is in the stomach; it is sometimes impossible for him to drink hot fluids, they cause sweat about the face and head and cause hot flushes. (Bar. c.)
Silica is disturbed by the extremes of heat and cold, easily affected, in changes even of a few degrees; he has complaints from being overheated; he gets overheated easily, sweats easily from a slight change in the temperature and comes down with a cold.
Case: A physician waiting on an obstetrical case, had a little difficulty in the last stage and he became overheated; putting on his overcoat and hat he went out on the porch to cool off and was taken down with asthma, violent cough, copious expectoration with gagging and vomiting which lasted him for months.
The acute remedies he had taken only palliated, but a dose of Silica cured him almost as quickly as he was taken down; he could not tolerate a warm room; the acute complaints of Silica are often worse in a warm room and from heat.
Silica has an aggravation from milk. Many times the infant is unable to take any kind of milk and, hence, the physician is driven to prescribe all the foods in the market if he does not know the right remedy. Natrum carb. and Silica are both useful when the mother's milk causes diarrhoea and vomiting.
The routinist is likely to give such medicines as Aethusa, entirely forgetting Silica. The latter, as well as Natrum carb., has sour vomiting and sour curds in the stool.
"Aversion the mother's milk and vomiting." "Diarrhea from milk." Put these two together.
Although the patient has an aversion to hot things and desires to eat cold things, yet in chest complaints cold water, ice cream and cold, things in general, increase the cough to gagging, and then the retching is dreadful; violent, retching, gagging cough. Retching from an endeavor to expectorate is usually controlled by Carbo veg., but Silica his it.
"Water brash, with chilliness, with brown tongue; nausea and vomiting of what is drunk, worse in the morning; water tastes bad; vomits after drinking."
The Silica stomach is weak, in a do-nothing state; old dyspeptics that have been vomiting a long time, especially those who have an, aversion to hot food, who cannot take milk, are averse to meat, where, the mental and bodily symptoms agree.
Silica was one of the greatest remedies for the chronic diarrhoea in the soldiers of our Civil War. It cured a fair percentage of those sick from sleeping on damp ground, eating all sorts of food until the stomach and bowels were prostrated, from long marches, from going into the South from the cold North, from becoming overheated. It is like Sulphur in these symptoms.
Silica has some pain in the stomach and bowels, but there is more soreness to pressure; colic and flatulence and tenderness to pressure; a chronic soreness in the stomach and if it goes on too long, a tubercular state comes on.
Abdomen: Abdominal pain relieved by heat; distension of the bowels with flatulence and rumbling.
Enlarged abdomen in children and adults (Bar. c.); tightness across the abdomen. Disturbed by the pressure of the clothes and worse after eating; the decided feature is the amelioration from heat.
Constipation from inability of the rectum to expel the faeces. It is seldom that the stool lies in the rectum without urging like Alumina; there is much urging to stool but inability to expel. The stool may be in small balls or large and soft or large and hard, but there is much straining and sweating about the head and great suffering while straining; the rectum becomes impacted, he strains until he is weak and exhausted, the stool slips back; and he gives up in despair.
The only way he can relieve himself is by some mechanical method. Great straining at stool belongs to many remedies, but especially to Alumina, Alumen, China, Natr. mur., Nux vom., Nux mosch., and Silica.
Silica has removed tape-worm, when the symptoms agree(Calc., Sulf.)
It has also cured fistulous openings. Patients who have a tendency to phthisis are subject to abscesses about the region of the rectum, that break inside or out and form complete or incomplete openings.
These seem to take the place of what would otherwise come, and if healed by operation or other external means, the tendency is to end in chest trouble, either in form of a fixed catarrh or tubercular infiltrations.
Silica is one of the remedies that turns the constitution into order and in one to five years the opening ceases to be necessary and it will heal. Surgeons heal it up at once, and for a time the patient is comfortable, but in a few years he breaks down.
Caust., Berb., Calc. c., Calc. phos., Graph., Sulph., etc., are suitable; in such cases. Silica here follows Thuja well.
Urinary : Suppurative conditions in the urinary tract, catarrh of the mucous membranes; old inveterate catarrh of the bladder with pus and blood in the urine; copious, stringy, deposits in the urine.
Prostatitis, suppuration, thick, fetid pus from the urethra. Gonorrhea, pus, or pus like discharge from the urethra, slight, shreddy discharge, bloody, purulent discharge. It is sometimes thick, or is curdy; this is from any mucous membrane.
Men: Abscesses along the penis, in the perineum, prostate gland, testes.
Chronic inflammation and induration of the testes with much pain; testes feel as if squeezed, sensitive, painful. Hydrocele in boys or adults.
In the male, impotence, weakness of the genitals after coition, easily exhausted, lacks power; exhausted if he has coition with anything like ordinary frequency; it takes him a week or ten days to rest up (Agar.).
Much sweating of the genitals with exhaustion, tired out in the spine, weak back. Involuntary discharge of urine at night; enuresis in little boys and girls.
Women: In women a prostrated condition of the sexual functions.
Serous cysts in the vagina, fistulous openings and abscesses about the vulva, which heal with hard nodules or do not heal at all; little oozing fistulae, offensive, cheesy discharge. They heal in little nodules and then break out again in the same nidus. Women who are subject to these abscesses.
Bloody discharge between the periods. In Silica there is very easy flow of blood from the uterus; a hemorrhagic flow comes on before the menses from excitement, and especially when nursing; when the child is put to the breast a flow of blood starts.
Notice the distinction between Calc. and Silica. Calc. has a tendency to flow during lactation, but not when the child is put to the breast.
Silica cures hydrosalpinx and pyosalpinx, with copious, watery discharge from the uterus. Sometimes a woman has a lump on one or the other side of the uterus, which steadily increases and all at once there is a flooding of watery, bloody, purulent fluid and the lump disappears, soon to fill up again and empty in the same way in a gushing flow.
Such are the manifestations of hydrosalpinx and pyosalpinx. Entire absence of the menses for months; amenorrhoea.
Serous, cysts in the vagina as large as a pea or an orange, projecting from the vagina or projecting upwards and flattened out in conformation with it. Many little cysts like hickory-nuts grouped together. Rhod. and Silica have cured these even when there is a paucity of other symptoms.
"Leucorrhea, profuse, acrid, corroding, milky, preceded by cutting around the navel, causing biting pain, especially after acrid food; during urination; in gushes; with cancer of the uterus. Hard lumps in the mamme."
Threatened abscesses of the breasts. If the remedy is given in time, it will abort the entire trouble. Where the remedy has come too late and suppuration is inevitable, Silica comes in for its share. There may be throbbing, tenderness, and weight, yet the remedy controls the pain, hastens the conclusion, and the opening comes naturally, discharges little and closes at once. As sure as an anodyne is given, a hot poultice applied, you will fail with your remedies.
There is too much blood in the part, and the application of a poultice increases the trouble; it causes an increased determination of blood to the part, and if suppuration takes place it causes more breaking down of tissue. Instead of a thimbleful of pus you will have cupfuls for days and half of the gland is destroyed
Women who are so weak they tend to abort, or no conception takes place. It would seem if the organs were tired out and unable to perform their functions.
The infant has all sorts of troubles. It grows up sickly; cannot tolerate its mother's milk or indeed any kind of food; vomiting and diarrhoea. A healthy child will digest even unwholesome milk.
Chest: The Silica cough is a dangerous one; the remedy suits the early stage of phthisis, when the lung is not extensively involved; it suits cough of catarrhal character when the symptoms agree.
If there is small abscess in the lung with no tendency to heal, it brings about repair, causes contraction of its walls. Inveterate cases of catarrh of the chest with asthmatic wheezing, overexertion. After violent exertion and overheating, gets in a draft, or takes cold from a bath, becomes chilled.
Humid asthma, coarse rattling, the chest seems filled with mucus, seems as if he would suffocate. Especially the asthma of old sycotics, or in children of sycotic parents. It competes with Nat. sul. in such cases. The patient is pale, waxy, anaemic, with great prostration and thirst.
Asthmatic attacks from suppressed gonorrhoea, with liability to develop complaints from over-exertion and over-heating, as in most sycotics.
Dry, teasing cough with hoarseness, threatening tuberculosis of the larynx, peculiar cracked voice from thickening of the laryngeal mucous membrane or tubercular involvement; soreness of the chest threatening miliary tuberculosis, with aggravation from cold and amelioration from warm drinks.
Pulmonary affections in stone-cutters. The fine dust causes chronic irritation. Silica establishes a suppuration and throws off these particles of stone.
Expectoration profuse, foetid, green, purulent; only during the day viscid, milky, acrid-mucus, at times pale, frothy blood.
Chronic tendency for colds to settle in the chest and bring on asthmatic symptoms. Chronic bronchitis; inflammation of the lungs with suppuration. Silica especially suits the later stages of pneumonia and the old, chronic complaints following pneumonia.
Slow recovery after pneumonia (Lyc., Sulph., Phos., Sil., Calc.). Flushes, rattling in the chest. Flushes in the face during the day (Sulph., Sep., Lach.), rattling like Ant. tart., flushes like Sulph. and Lyc.
Phthisis; thick, yellow, green, foetid sputa, more pronounced coldness than Calc., and head sweat, pains in the lungs, sore lungs, stitches.
In the extremities we have inflammation of the periosteum. Corns (Ant. cr., Graph.). Ingrowing toe-nails. Rheumatism of the soles of the feet. Cannot walk (Ant. cr., Med., Ruta, Sil.). Begins to sweat as soon as he falls asleep (Puls., Con.).
Epilepsy; aura in the solar plexus creeping into the chest and stomach.
Complementary to Calc., Puls., and Thuja.
Spigelia Anthelmintica
Pains: Spigelia is especially known by its pains.
It is indicated in persons who are debilitated from taking cold and who have become rheumatic, run down, victims of pain.
Hardly a nerve in the body escapes; shooting, burning, tearing, neuralgic pains; they are most marked about the eyes and jaws, neck, face, teeth, shoulders, burning like hot needles through the face and neck in any direction, stitching, tearing, worse from motion, from doing anything, even thinking, mental exertion, worse from eating.
Pains in the neck and shoulders are better from heat; those about the eyes are better from cold. Shooting, tearing pains in the extremities like hot wires.
Sometimes the pains are worse from lying down, but most commonly better from keeping still; worse from light, eating, motion, jarring; so sore in the painful region that any gentle exercise like going up or down
stairs, or riding in a carriage that jar, makes the pain unbearable.
The Spigelia patient is sensitive to cold, to atmospheric changes, he is a rheumatic patient, but the nerves a- re attacked by neuralgia.
Eyes: Violent pains about the eyes.
Routine practice limits the use of the remedy to this region. Worse from hard pressure though sometimes better from it, if gentle and prolonged, firm pressure, but any movement of the pressing hand aggravates. The part is turgesced and inflamed. Eyes red and engorged.
Chest: Neuralgic affections of the muscles of the chest.
Many of the Spigelia pains in the chest are attributed to the heart, but there is intercostal neuralgia; tearing pains shooting into the shoulders and neck, especially the left side and down the arm. Pains shooting hither and thither.
Irregularity of the heart. Painful complaints associated with valvular troubles, especially growing out of rheumatism. Pericarditis and endocarditis of rheumatic character. Thrusting pains in the chest like a knife, in the eye like a knife.
Mind: This remedy needs further proving, its mental symptoms are scarcely known.
"Weak memory; disinclination to work; restless and anxious, solicitude about the future; gloomy, suicidal mood; afraid of pointed things, pins, etc.; easily irritated or offended."
This is all that is thought worthy of admission into the Guiding Symptoms, showing that the mental state has not been well brought out.
Many complaints are manifested in the morning; tired in the morning and full of tearing pains.
Old anemic subjects where there has been a transfer of the complaints to the nerves; broken down, pallid, nervous, with neuralgia, palpitation, irregular pulse. Vertigo on rising; gets up with violent pains and dizziness. So nervous that she must "fly," full of excitement, cannot keep still, cannot keep control of herself.
Head: Pulsating and stitching in the head; sometimes better lying with the head high; worse from stooping, motion, and from noise.
Sometimes better from washing in cold water when the pain is about the eyes and head, but worse after washing; better while the cold water is applied. With these headaches and neuralgias there is stiff neck and shoulders, an apparent stiffness in that he cannot move on account of pain.
He sits in a chair as if transfixed, is aggravated from noise, light, from seeing things move in the room, which he must follow with his eyes.
"Fine burning, tearing pains in the brain." It seems to be in the brain, but is more likely in the nerves of the scalp.
"Violent pain in the left parietal bone on motion or walking or making a misstep; toward evening-violent pressure and pressing outward in the forehead, worse from stooping, worse from pressure with the hand; tensive tearing pain in the forehead, especially beneath the frontal eminence, extending towards orbitis."
Notice the intensity of the pains. Burrowing, tearing pain in the occiput, in the left side of the vertex and forehead, worse from motion, from loud noise, and when he speaks loudly or even on opening the mouth slightly; better when lying down.
Pressive pain in the right side of the forehead, involving the right eye, in the morning in bed, but still more after rising; pain deeply seated, unaffected by pressure, very acute on motion, on suddenly turning the head, the brain seemed to be loose; worse from every joy, step, or straining at stool.
When moving the muscles of the face, there is a sensation as if the head would burst. Sensation as if a band were about the head. Neuralgic pain settles in and above the left eye, or below it, from cold in damp, rainy weather; hyperesthesia of the filaments of the fifth pair.
On the pain first beginning there is not so much hyperesthesia, but as it goes on this increases and the eye becomes congested. I have seen the pains so severe that they produced perfect prostration, cold sweat, vomiting.
The Hepar patient is so sensitive to pain that he becomes unconscious; faints with the pain. Cham. feels pain with such intensity that he gives way to violent frenzy, irritability, and outbursts of anger.
The Spigelia patient suffers intensely and the pain leaves its mark, the part becomes red and inflamed and sensitive. The head pains are worse from warmth; better temporarily from cold; the pains in other regions are the reverse.
The Phos. head and stomach symptoms are better from cold; the chest and body are better from warmth. In Ars. the head is often better by washing in cold water, while the patient himself is sensitive to the cold and wants warmth in the rest of his complaints.
Eyes again: Spigelia is full of visual symptoms; visual symptoms bring on complaints; at times he can do nothing but look straight ahead, for he has vertigo even when there is no pain, from looking downwards, every, thing goes round in a whirl.
Such a state is common to many people when they look down from a height, but Spigelia has it from looking down along his nose, so he sits and looks straight ahead.
Esophoria; exophoria disturbances in accommodation all sorts of tiny spasmodic conditions it is most difficult to fit glasses no settled focus, no fixed vision. Spigelia has from a mere neuralgic state what Ruta has from eye strain. Latent errors of vision.
Eyes that are always changing need a remedy. Stabbing pains in and around the eye, often radiating in every direction from one point. Eye-ball sensitive to touch. Eyes worse when thinking about them. Worse at night. Intolerable, pressing pain, worse on turning the eye, dizzy on attempting to move the eyes, must turn the whole head to see.
Pain radiates to the frontal sinuses and head. Sensation as if the eye were too large for its orbit. I remember a patient who had been traveling about from oculist to oculist, who had many visual troubles and no glasses would suit.
She had one sharp, stinging pain over the left eye day and night and she could only sleep when worn out. Lac fel. cured. Constant, fine, stinging pain over left eye was brought out by the provers of cat's milk.
This medicine has cured a pterygium, probably a false pterygium, that came from violent neuralgia, prolonged and lasting for months.
Chest: Stitching pains in the chest, worse from the least movement, breathing, sensation of tearing in the chest; trembling feeling in the chest when moving the arms or from any movement.
Can lie only on the right side with the head high. Rheumatic troubles especially in the left side of the chest. Feeling as if the heart were compressed with a hand. Purring feeling over the region of the heart, wave-like motion not synchronous with the pulse.
Waving palpitation not synchronous with the pulse. Trembling of the carotids. Acute pericarditis with anxiety and weight in the praecordium. These troubles following a rheumatic attack, at its close or many months after the fever has subsided. Spigelia is seldom indicated in rheumatism of the heart in phlegmatic persons who do not feel intensely.
When a rheumatic affection attacks the venous side of the heart, and there is a sense of stuffiness, of fullness through the whole body, limbs swollen, but do not pit on pressure, face mottled, it is a serious case and may end in Bright's disease and death.
Spongia Tosta Mind: The mental symptoms of Spongia show that it is a heart remedy.
When a remedy produces the anxiety, fear, and dyspnoea found in Spongia, it will most likely turn out to be a cardiac remedy, unless these conditions are connected with irritation and inflammatory diseases of the brain.
In this drug we find without any cerebral symptoms, marked anxiety, fear of death, and suffocation, associated with palpitation and uneasiness in the region of the heart. It is especially related to cases where there is pain and a sense of stuffiness and fullness in the cardiac region, in the chest, with dyspnoea, anxiety, fear of death, feat, of the future, fear that something dreadful is going to happen.
Wakens at night in great fear and it is some time before he can rationalize his surroundings (Aesc., Lyc., Samb., Lach., Phos., and Carbo veg.).
Spongia is closely related to Aconite, which also excites the heart, brings on anxiety, fear, and restlessness, fear of death, predicts the hour of death, but this is associated with a marked febrile excitement. Spongia has febrile excitement in a minimum degree.
It is much deeper in its action than Aconite. Its cardiac diseases tend to develop slowly, with actual tissue changes, enlargement of the heart, it takes on a steady growth and the valves become changed, do not fit, hence, there are blowing and whizzing sounds, regurgitation with the mental symptoms. The two are similar in croup, but Spongia is deeper, slower in onset, taking several days for its development.
Cough: Aconite from exposure to a dry cold wind takes a cold to-day and, of course, comes down with croup to night in the first sleep. Before midnight has a dry spasmodic cough; hoarse cough; Spongia has taken a cold yesterday or the day before.
First there is roughness and dryness of the mucous membranes, sneezing. Both remedies have croup before midnight with dry, hoarse, barking cough, sawing respiration and dry air passages.
They are so similar that when Aconite only partially controls the condition and it returns the next night, or lasts on beyond midnight, Spongia becomes its natural follower. Spongia comes in because it was probably the remedy in the beginning.
Cases that grow worse each succeeding night, hoarse barking and crowing before midnight, though it also has a croup after midnight. It is a deep-acting remedy though its complaints sometimes come on suddenly.
Hepar is worse at night and in the morning. And when Aconite has apparently controlled, but the croup returns the next morning, Hepar comes in. Or if it comes on again the next evening with rattling Hepar will also be suitable.
Dry, with no rattling is Spongia. If the child wants to be covered or says that it is chilly, Hepar. If it says the room is too warm and kicks the covers off, it needs Calc. sul.
The Spongia patient is worse from a warm room, from heat. Wants to be cool like Iodine, but is better from warm drinks, like Ars., Nux, Lyc.
Glands: The tendency to affect the glands is striking.
As a matter of fact, all the glands are affected; they gradually enlarge and become increasingly hard. Glands that have undergone inflammation and, are increased in size become hard, or they take on hypertrophy.
Hypertrophy of the heart (Kalmia, Sepia, Naja). Spongia has cured endocarditis, cardiac croup and many other inflammatory diseases of the heart resulting from rheumatism. Hypertrophy of the thyroid, goitre, when the heart is affected and the eyes protruding.
Cervical glands enlarged; inveterate cases of enlarged testes; orchitis from a suppressed gonorrhea, a cold or other causes; gradually increasing hardness.
Chest: The whole respiratory apparatus is acted upon; cardiac dyspnoea and the most severe forms of asthma.
Dryness of the air passages with whistling and wheezing, seldom rattling, must sit up and bend forward; at times after great dyspnoea, white, tough mucus forms in the air passages, difficult to expectorate; it comes up and often has to be swallowed (Arn., Caust., Lach., Kali c., Kali s., Nux mos., Sep., Staph.)
Dyspnoea worse lying down.
Head and face: The modality is common to its other complaints; violent, basilar headache forces him to sit up in bed and keep still. Holding the head in the upright position relieves the dull pressure in the occiput.
There are many headaches. In the occiput, in the forehead, congestive headaches, but most of them are associated with goitre, cardiac affections and asthma; they are due, probably, to sluggish circulation in the brain.
Face distressed in croup; anxious; livid; pale and bloated; blue, pale with sunken eyes; red with anxious expression; alternating red and pale; cold sweat.
These symptoms are the natural effects of difficult breathing and are, therefore, not essential in the selection of a remedy. As primary symptoms, they would probably indicate Ars., but when due to cardiac difficulties, they are unimportant.
"Sore throat worse after eating sweet things.
Thyroid gland swollen even with the chin; at night, suffocating spells, barking cough, with stinging in the throat and soreness in the abdomen."
Throat: Enlargement of the tonsils. Difficult swallowing.
Spongia is the remedy when dyspnoea and cough are relieved by warm food; may be better from warm drinks.
Laryngeal troubles with great hoarseness, in individuals tending towards phthisis, with tubercular heredity, cachectic aspect, weak lungs, but no deposit of tubercle. But all at once hoarseness sets in.
There is a tendency for the larynx to become involved in phthisical patients that need Spongia. This patient takes an acute cold and it settles in the larynx with hoarseness. Look out for that patient, for there is a tendency for tubercles to deposit where there is inflammation, and the infiltration instead of being fibrinous may become tubercular. Tendency for the larynx to be first involved in phthisical patients.
In Spongia do not look for the exsudative, but the infiltrative form of croup. Hoarseness with loss of voice, great dryness of the larynx from a cold; coryza, sneezing, the whole chest rings, is as dry as a horn; voice hissing, croupy, nose dry.
There is very little accumulation of mucus, but at a late date ulceration begins and then there may be a copious expectoration of mucus. In proportion to the extent of rattling, this remedy is decreasingly indicated. Hepar has the coarse rattling with much mucus.
At times an adult takes cold and rawness of the larynx and trachea is the result. On going to bed she is taken with a spasmodic constriction of the larynx.
Laryngismus stridulous is commonly found in women. Ign., Gels., Lauroc. and Spongia. Ign. and Gels. will cure eight out of ten cases.
The larynx is sensitive to touch in croup, etc., like Phos.
Dry, spasmodic cough, troublesome cough; cold things taken into the stomach aggravate. (Veratr. is better from cold water, but the cough is worse.) If the room becomes too warm, there is a dry, tickling, teasing, croupy spasmodic cough.
In cardiac and asthmatic troubles it resembles Lach., in the rousing up from sleep in suffocation; after the sleep the dyspnoea is worse.
The Phos. dyspnoea is often increased after sleeping, with suffocation. Lach. has it in a marked degree; in phthisis when the patient is about to die, there is sweat on going to sleep; dyspnoea on going to sleep and on waking. Lach. palliates and must be repeated.
Cardiac affections accompanied with thick, green or yellow expectoration like pus and dyspnoea on falling to sleep so that he must keep awake as long as he can, fear of sleep in advanced chest troubles. Grindelia robusta will palliate such a case and if the condition is only catarrhal and not tuberculous, it will cure.
Study especially the cardiac symptoms.
"The symptoms of circulation are worse; from mental lassitude, from coughing, from lying on the right side, before menses, after lying down, sitting bent forward, from smoking, from going up stairs.
Awakens in fright and feels as if suffocating. Falling asleep early at night, suffocation awakens." I have mentioned these symptoms, but read them for emphasis.
Ebullitions, distended veins; dropsy in cavities of the body. Especially suits young persons of tubercular parents, who remain weak, are pallid and do not thrive. Tubercular diathesis.
Itching but no eruption. Seems always ready for an eruption to appear. Has only simplest herpetic eruptions. Itching all over and no visible eruption.
In acute endocarditis, the principal remedies are Spongia, Abrot., Sepia, and Kalmia. Naja in valvular diseases.
Squilla
Squilla was given in the olden times by the old school in all lung, bronchial, and kidney affections; pneumonia, asthma, scanty urine and dropsical affections.
Cough: Has a loose morning cough and a dry evening cough (Alum., Carbo veg., Phos. ac., Sep., Stram., Puls., Squilla).
Puls. and Squil, being strong here, but Squil. has a hard cough; coughs, gags, sneezes; urine escapes and quite frequently faeces; the patient coughs until be is covered with sweat; he gags and coughs and finally succeeds in raising two or three little lumps of white, tenacious mucus; it is a spasmodic cough caused by mucus in the trachea or a tickling, creeping sensation in the chest.
The loose morning cough is worse than the dry evening cough. Patient chilly cannot have the least draft; wants plenty of clothing and is very sensitive to cold; not so in Puls. Urine is generally copious, watery, colorless.
About 1 A.M. to 12 or1 P.M. there is the most dyspnoea from filling up of the chest with mucus; this same feeling returns during the hour, but it is from cardiac weakness.
Copious, colorless urine is one of its important symptoms and resembles Jgn., but Squil. is not a hysterical patient like Ign.
Quite similar to Can. Ind. or Gels. in brain affections, but Squil. has not many brain affections nor many febrile symptoms. Phos. has inflammation of the brain and when the dangerous turn comes this increase of urine is a bad sign.
Puls, tearful, then copious urine. Squil. copious colorless urine in diabetes; when this seems to disappear and chest symptoms appear, these troubles disappear and kidney troubles appear, these would disappear and dropsy comes up; when the urine would get copious again these dropsical symptoms would disappear and Squil. acts a long time.
There is a copious, colorless flow from the nose, more especially in the morning; the cough is similar to Tart. emet.
Squil. in its internal nature is quite like Thuja in regard to its spurting urine and its spasmodic cough; with the escape of urine there is more or less of escape of faeces of a dark brown or black fluid in frothy bubbles, very offensive, painless, involuntary.
Respiration difficult with stitches in the chest when breathing and coughing. Great dyspnoea, the child cannot drink; seizes the cup eagerly, but can drink only in sips; frequently obliged to take a deep breath which provokes a cough; shortness of breath on every exertion.
Chest: Pains in the chest aggravated in the morning. Dull rheumatic pains aggravated when exercising; ameliorated while at rest. Evening dry cough with sweetish expectoration. Great heat in the body. Follows well after Bry. Absolute lack of sweat is a characteristic.
Dry cough at 1 P.M. worse from cold water and cold air (Rumex). Bell. has cough at 1 P.M. worse from uncovering, red face, congestion in head. Lach. soon after going to sleep, which may be u P.M.
Nasal discharge acrid, corroding, worse in the morning; violent sneezing. Stool dark brown or black. Seldom much cough during day.
Pneumonia: Stitches when inhaling, jerking pains; always right side; catarrh of the chest and threatened pneumonia after hemorrhage from the lungs. Soreness in the chest, worse from motion. Bry. will often palliate and the case will go into Squilla.
Stannum Metallicum
Stannum is especially suited to persons who have long been growing feeble.
This is so striking that it may be said that some deep seated constitutional state must be present. There is a history of increasing weakness, cachexia, catarrhal conditions, and neuralgia dating back over years. There
is sensitiveness to pain and an increasing aversion to doing anything, aversion to business in a man, and in a woman, to going about her housework; always tired, all work becomes irksome.
The countenance becomes increasingly sallow, even to a waxy, cachectic aspect. Once who has been growing weaker and develops neuralgia of the face, eyes, stomach, and intestines; not the shooting, tearing pains often described, but a pain beginning gradually, increasing steadily and then diminishing gradually.
Pains: The pain sometimes begins with sunrise, increases until noon and gradually diminishes, and ceases with sunset. On the other hand, it may begin at any time, as often at 10 A.M. and increasing for ten or twenty minutes, then gradually diminishing, but especially worse at noon.
Cactus has a sun headaches, Kalmia has a similar headache, not so regularly increasing and diminishing, but especially worse at noon. Cactus has a sun headache. Natrum mur. has never been known to cause it, but has cured it especially when beginning at 10 A.M. and worse from 2 to 3 P- m. Sang. headache coming and going with the sun.
The phthisical tendency of Stannum is closely allied to the neuralgias. If these patients settle down into a neuralgic constitution, the deposit of tubercles is postponed, but most of them then seek palliation with the inevitable result of hastening the end. If the Stannum neuralgia is suppressed, we will see phthisis making its appearance, particularly phthisis pituitosa.
Nature seems to be able to throw off effects through mucous discharges. If the neuralgia is not permitted to, have sway the patient becomes oversensitive to cold, takes cold easily. When let alone every cold settled in the nerves and every draft caused neuralgias about the eyes, sensitive to every change in the weather, the hydrogenoid constitution of Grauvogl.
But when palliated in any way by Quinine and inappropriate homoeopathic remedies that have the tendency to, catch cold in the chest like Phos., he after a while does not get over his cold, but there is a continuous catarrh of the chest, and later he will die of miliary tuberculosis. Stannum is useful in warding off phthisis, and is a wonderful palliative in that disease.
The pain has been likened to the pulling of a string, gradually increasing and gradually letting up. The Puls. pain is somewhat similar in its first half; it gradually becomes intense, but suddenly lets up with a snap;
comes gradually and stops suddenly.
Remember what is said about the Bell. pain. It comes suddenly and reaches its intensity at once, where it may remain for hours, but ceases suddenly.
The Stannum pain is at times so severe that there is a throbbing pulsating intermingled with it, and the mind seems stunned.
"Headache every morning, over one or the other eye, mostly the left, gradually extending over the whole forehead and increasing and decreasing gradually, often with vomiting."
"Violent, glowing, beating pain." It is sometimes attended with burning. "Felt as if the head would burst with inward blows.
Neuralgia of the left eye gradually increasing from 10 A.M. to noon, then gradually decreasing, with lachrymation during pain.
Intermittent supra-orbital neuralgia from 10 A.M. to 3 or 4 P.M., gradually increasing and attaining its acme, and then again gradually decreasing, after the abuse of quinine."
This is when the body is weak, with sallow countenance and tendency to phthisis, full of pain, and the earlier history shows that instead of taking cold in the chest or nose, as others take cold, every cold settles in the nerves.
Finally he begins to take cold in the chest, with dyspnoea, violent, racking cough, gagging, retching, vomiting, and the most intense sufferings.
Copious, thick, yellow-green, bloody expectoration, which tastes sweetish (Phos.). Retching when coughing is marked; thick, white, yellow or green tenacious mucus. Cannot walk, cannot do anything without cough.
Always tired; it is an effort to work. Wakens in the morning with the chest filled with mucus, and coughs
and expectorates, and yet some remains; he gags, retches and vomits, and it strings out of the mouth tasting sweetish, sometimes salty or sour.
Voice: This great weakness is manifested in the voice; hoarseness, loss of voice; the vocal cords will not respond; a paralytic weakness. Talking makes him feel weak, especially in the chest.
"Hoarseness, weakness, emptiness in the chest on beginning to sing, so that she was constantly obliged to stop and take a deep breath; at times a few expulsive coughs removed the hoarseness for a few minutes.
Rawness in the larynx."
Rawness in the trachea and smarting all the way down when coughing. Irritation to cough, as from mucus in the trachea; or breathing, with cough either loose or dry, felt more while sitting bent over than when walking.
"Accumulation of great quantities of mucus in the trachea, easily thrown off by coughing.
Oppressed breathing from ascending, from the slightest movement when lying down, in the evening, from coughing."
"Cough in fatiguing paroxysms; epigastric region painful as if beaten; violent, shattering, deep, short, from time to time, as from weakened chest, with a hoarse.
Weak sound.
Cough caused by talking, singing, laughing, lying on the side and from drinking anything warm." "Sputa like white of egg; yellow, green pus; sweetish, putrid, sour or saltish during day.
Chest so weak that he cannot talk; empty feeling in the chest,"
This remedy is frequently indicated in cases where the routinist would prescribe Bry., etc., in low potencies to loosen the cough. Stannum is not dangerous in phthisis, and will palliate the case if it is incurable.
It will not rouse up the whole economy like Silica, but there may be an aggravation of the nervous symptoms; if there is anything to build on it will cause the patient to rally. If it brings back his old neuralgic pains, and you know he has not a long time to live, and seems to suffer much, Puls. is the natural antidote.
When a loose, easy cough is turned into one that is violent, dry and racking under Stannum, and seems to be inclined to be prolonged, Puls. will restore the loose cough. This is not a good action of the remedy; in incurable cases you can get the best results by not going too high.
Women: Another feature is seen in women.
If you ever meet with a case who has suffered with violent neuralgia and she says since the obliteration of these pains she has had a copious, thick yellow, green leucorrhoea, think of Stannum. There is great weakness, which seems to proceed from the chest. The leucorrhoea has saved her from consumption.
Menses too early and too profuse; bearing down in the uterine region; prolapsus uteri and vaginae. Paralytic symptoms; writers’ cramp; women cannot let go of the broom (Dros. cures most cases). "Constipation; stools hard, dry, knotty, or insufficient and green."
Inactive rectum, i. e., a paralytic state; even though there is much urging there is inability to pass the stool, which at times is soft. Colic better from pressure, lying on the stomach (Coloc., Cupr.); worse from motion; better from bending double.
"Very much exhausted from talking or reading aloud.
Great lassitude from walking; weariness of the whole body, especially when ascending stairs great sense of weakness in larynx and chest, thence all over the body trembling worse from slow exercise."
Staphysagria
Mind: The mental symptoms are very important, and the impressions made upon the mind and thence upon the body guide to Staphysagria as a remedy.
Excitable, easily aroused to anger, but seldom irascible, that is, easily disturbed and excited, but seldom manifests it.
Suitable in cases where complaints come from pent up wrath, suppressed anger, suppressed feelings. The person becomes speechless from suppressed indignation, anger with indignation. Complaints brought on by these causes; irritable bladder with frequent urging to urinate, lasting many days after suppressed wrath, after insults.
"Great indignation about things done by others or by himself; grieves about consequences."
A gentleman comes in contact with one beneath his station and an altercation takes place, an argument which ends in insult, and the gentleman turns his back on the other. He goes home and suffers; he does not speak it out, but controls it and then suffers from it.
He has sleepless nights and many days of fatigue, brain-fag; for days and weeks he cannot add nor subtract, makes mistakes in writing and speaking, has irritability of the bladder, colic, etc.
Loss of memory with a sense of weight between the eyes; it is difficult to say whether this is a feeling in the head or an effort to describe a dullness of mind. Feels as if a ball of wood were in the forehead, or as if the whole cerebrum were made of wood; it feels numb.
It is difficult to state whether it is a condition of the mind or head. Accompanying this sensation of a lump in the forehead is a feeling as if the whole back of the head were hollow; the patient may describe it as a feeling of numbness or a lack of sensation.
"Indifferent, low-spirited, dullness of mind after onanism."
Staph. cures these conditions when they are the result of sexual excitement, masturbation, excesses in venery, allowing the mind to dwell too much on venereal subjects. Thinking on sexual relations. These patients are irritable, easily fatigued, most excitable, and when they have to control their emotions they suffer intensely.
One who is in health can easily put aside a controversy, knowing that he has done what is right, but a Staph. patient when he has to control himself goes all to pieces trembles from head to foot, loses his voice, his ability to work, cannot sleep and a headache follows.
Many a time a man has come into my office with blue lips, trembling hands, pains about the heart and all over, and he thinks he is going to die. He tells a story of an altercation and pent up wrath, and Staph. stops his trembling and quiets him. Without it he would have sleepless nights, brain-fag, prostration and headache. This state belongs especially to those who have indulged in sexual excesses.
Now, the next step. The senses are in this same irritable state, so that the tips of the fingers are sensitive, the ears are sensitive to noise, the tongue is sensitive to tastes and the nun to odors; so sensitive that everything is painfully sensated.
Every little inflamed spot will have in its center sensitive points, little nerve spots; ulcers when touched cause the patient to go all to pieces and a convulsion threatens.
Hoemorrhoidal tumors are so sensitive that they cannot be touched. Little nerve tumors form in the skin, little polypoid growths the size of a wheat grain and denuded of epithelium, covered with moisture, red,
inflamed, blue, and a mere touch will throw the patient into convulsions and suffering for days and nights. A hypersensitive nerve growth will come out on the hand or on the back. Sometimes it turns back.
Women: Again, a little wart will come out, especially about the genitals and anus, little caruncular growths about the urethra and vagina, so sensitive that if nipped between the fingers the patient will go into spasms, especially if a woman.
Staph. suits all three of the miasms.
These nervous states run all through the complaints. Look for a case of Staph. where the whole mind and nervous system are in a fret.
The Staph. headache is a numb, dull pain in the occiput and forehead, especially in these nervous constitutions.
"Sensation as of a round ball in the forehead, sitting firmly there even when shaking the, head." Headaches from vexation and indignation.
Crusty, squamous eruptions on the scalp.
"Painful sensitiveness of the scalp, skin peels off, with itching and smarting, worse in the evening and from getting warm."
The scales are lifted up by a watery exudate and the denuded surface is extremely sensitive to touch.
New growths about the lids and balls of the eyes, extremely painful to the touch. Meibomian tumors (Con., Thuja), in irritable children (Kreos).
Another feature in Staph, is its action on the glands; scrofulous glands; glands of the neck enlarge; enlarged and indurated ovaries and testes; stitching, tearing pains in the glands everywhere. Hardness and chronic induration.
Stitching, tearing pains along the course of the nerves; in the heart, and as in such a nervous patient the mind is likely to be on the heart, the stitching pains in the intercostals are supposed to be in the heart. Stitching pains directly through the chest to the back.
Swelling of the tonsils after the abuse of Mercury. Chronic tonsilitis, tonsils are not large but hard from previous attacks of acute tonsilitis; strumous diathesis; cross and irritable.
"Pains come on after eating."
The Staph. patient has much difficulty in the bowels. Subject to chronic diarrhoea and to constipation. Colic, twitching, tearing pains in the abdomen. Diarrhoea from cold water, from eating, from indignation, anger, with flatulence of a terribly offensive odor like spoiled eggs.
"Chronic diarrhoea or dysentery of weakly, sickly children after anger; after being punished, after emotions." (Coloc. and Cham.)
Staph. and Coloc. resemble each other. In both, eating and drinking cause griping and stool, both have colic as if stones were squeezing; Staph. in the intestines, head and testes; Coloc. in the intestines and ovaries; both are worse from anger. Caust., Coloc. and Staph. follow each other like Sulph., Calc. and Lyc.
It often happens that nervous women soon after marriage are attacked with frequent and painful urging to urinate which becomes extremely troublesome and may last many days. Staph, is very comforting to the young wife.
Urinary and Genitals: Great teasing and tearing all night long bloody urine; involuntary discharge of urine, acrid and corroding, with burning, worse from motion.
Profuse discharge of pale urine with burning and urging. Burning during and after urination.
Staph. has cured enlarged prostate with frequent urging to urinate, especially in old men; continued teasing with dribbling.
"Frequent urging to urinate, with a scanty discharge in thin stream or discharge of urine in drops; may be followed by a sensation as if the bladder were not fully emptied."
The most distressing symptom of the male genitals is excitability, but there is also impotence, great weakness of the sexual organs; the sexual desire is greatly increased but there is impotence.
Useful in the results of secret vice, long practiced. "Seminal emissions followed by great chagrin and mortification, prostration, dyspnoea.
Effects of onanism or sexual excesses; loss of memory, hypochondriasis, taciturnity, face sunken, abashed look, nocturnal emissions, backache, weak legs, relaxed organs, deficiency of vital heat and tendency to take cold, deep sunken, red, and lusterless eyes, hair falls out; loss of prostatic fluid and impairment of sexual desire; dull and contusive pains in the testicles, voluptuous itching of the scrotum, atrophy of the testicles."
Think of the extremely nervous patient.
Dry, sensitive warts about the genitals, from sycosis or from the abuse of Mercury, which cause a tendency to warty growths. Moist red, offensive warts belong to Thuja.
The testes dwindle as well as become inflamed and swollen; genitals waste away.
Sensation as if there were worms crawling over him. Crawling, etc., in the female external genitals, Coff., Plat., Petrol., Apis, Tarent. hisp, the latter has. While outer parts feel as if insects were biting. and crawling, better from heat or cold.
In the female there is violent sexual excitement, nymphomania with extreme mental and physical impressions; mind has been dwelling too much on sexual subjects.
"Very sharp, shooting pains in the ovary, which is exquisitely sore to touch; pains extend along crural regions and thighs.
Menses irregular, late and profuse, sometimes wanting; first of pale blood, then dark and clotted.
Scorbutic diathesis, vegetations of the vagina; stinging, itching of the vulva."
Miscellaneous: Stitching in the region of the heart; trembling of the body with nervous excitement is an excellent indication for Staph.
Effects from loss of blood, shock, from surgical operations, injuries from sharp instruments, incised wounds. Stinging, etc., in surgical wounds, cuts; colic after lithotomy, urging to stool, qualmishness, worse from drinking.
Tetter on the hands, itches and burns in the evening after scratching; numbness in the tips of the fingers; arthritic nodosities on the fingers.
I remember a patient suffering from gouty nodosities; he had lived a life of peculiar continence, dwelling on his vices, broken down in body. Staph. brought out an eruption on his legs as high up as the knees that looked like a pair of trousers.
One continuous coat of crusts which lasted a year before it dwindled, but he was greatly improved in his body and his enlarged joints gradually improved. The eruption was yellow, crusty, tough, leathery, and, when lifted up by the moisture beneath, it had to be cut off like a bandage; he was practically crippled; new crops came out on the parts clipped off. It was with difficulty that be walked, for the crusts cut him.
Bone troubles, exostoses, inflammation of the periosteum.
Acute articular rheumatism of fast or debilitated men, with shifting pains. Mercurial bone diseases. ulcers, caries, injuries caused by sharp, cutting instruments. Nightly bone pains. (Asa f., Merc., Sil.)
Stramonium
Mind: When considering Stram. the idea of violence comes into mind.
One cannot look upon a patient who needs Stram., or who has been poisoned with it, without wondering at the tremendous turmoil, the great upheaval taking place in mind and body.
Full of excitement, rage, everything is tumultuous, violent; the face looks wild, anxious, fearful; the eyes are fixed ona certain object; face flushed, hot raging fever with hot head and cold extremities, violent delirium. In his anxiety he often turns away from the light, wants it dark, is aggravated especially if the light is bright.
High fever with delirium; the heat is so intense that it may be mistaken for Bell., but it is usually a continued fever, only at times remittent, while the intense fever of Bell. is remittent always.
Stram. is like an earthquake in its violence. The mind is in an uproar; cursing, tearing the clothes, violent speech, frenzy, erotomania, exposing of the person. These symptoms are found in continued fevers, insanity, cerebral congestion. It is useful in violent typhoids.
It is useful in mania that has existed for some time; attacks of mania coming on in paroxysms, appearing with more or less suddenness, so that a single attack would look like Bell., but the history differentiates. Bell. would hardly be more than a palliative in the first attack, and the second exhibition of it would do nothing.
When the delirium is not on, the patient has the appearance of great suffering, forehead wrinkled, face pallid, sickly, haggard. In head pains this anxious look, indicative of intense suffering from meningeal involvement.
"Delirium bland, murmuring; violent, foolish, joyful, loquacious, incoherent chattering with open eyes; vivid; merry, with spasmodic laughter; furious, raving, wild; attempts to stab and bite; with queerest notions; with sexual excitement; fear as if a dog were attacking him."
Strange ideas about the formation of his body, that it is ill-shapen, elongated, deformed; strange feelings concerning his physical state. All sorts of illusions and hallucinations. One must distinguish between these states. An illusion is an appearance in the vision or mind which the patient knows is not true.
A hallucination is a state that appears to be true. A delusion is a more advanced state, when the patient thinks it is true and cannot be reasoned out of it. Fear and great anxiety on hearing running water.
He sees animals, ghosts, angels, departed spirits, devils, and knows they are not real, but later he is confident of it. He has these hallucinations especially in the dark. At times he has an aversion to a bright light which is painful, and again he must sit and look into an open fire, but this may cause cough and other symptoms.
"Sings amorous songs and utters obscene speech.
Crazy with distress, jumps out of bed, acts as if the bed were being drawn from under him. Screams until he is hoarse or loses his voice.
Screaches and screams day and night with fever, with forms of mania.
Hasty, hurries with all his might if he wants to go to another place."
Violent laughter with sardonic expression on his face.
"Child awakens terrified, knows no one, screams with fright, clings to those near."
Hyosc. has wild maniacal delirium, but with very little fever. In Stram. there is considerable fever. In Bell. the fever is in the afternoon and evening, 9 P.M. to 3 A.M., and then a remission.
Violent convulsions involving every muscle of the body, opisthotonos, violent distortions, contraction of the limbs, biting of the tongue and bleeding from the passages. During spasms, covered with cold sweat; sometimes almost as cold as ice; cold sweat in mania; this feature is equaled only by Camphor.
Hysterical convulsions of long standing, associated with spinal trouble; worse from fright. Convulsions in nervous, excitable people brought on by fright.
Puerperal convulsions and insanity. It has the septic nature. Those cases going on for a while as melancholic, low spirited; she believes she has sinned away her day of grace, yet she has lived an upright life; sad; imagines strange things, does strange things, until finally violent delirium comes on; she screams aloud; exhorts people to repent; face red, and eyes flashing; exhorts and prays in incoherent speech. In such cases Stram. should be compared with Veratr.
In cerebral congestions, the delirium subsides into unconsciousness the patient has the appearance of profound intoxication; pupils dilated or contracted (in Bell. they are dilated).
Marked stupor, stertorous breathing, lower jaw dropped. So in typhoid and the low forms of fever, foetor, oozing of blood from the mouth and other passages.
Throat and mouth dry, tongue dry, swollen, so that it fills the mouth, pointed, red like a piece of meat, bleeding from the mouth, sordes on the teeth, lips dry and cracked; at times violent thirst yet dread of water.
Diarrhoea copious, involuntary; abdomen tympanitic, involuntary urination.
Basilar meningitis from suppressed ear-discharge. The Old School have no remedy for such cases. Forehead wrinkled, eyes glassy, staring, dilated pupils and scarcely any fever; awful pain through the base of the skull and there is a history of necrosis about the ear.
Violent headache from walking in the sun, and from the heat of the sun. Aggravated all day and at night the patient must sit up because of increased pain on lying down; he is worse from every motion on jar; eyes fixed and glassy, face flushed, but later it is pale, eyes fixed on a corner of the room, motionless; delirium, says strange things. Pain in the occiput.
High grade inflammation which it carries to the finish. Pus forms, abscesses with excruciating pain (Hepar, Merc., Sil., Sulph.). Violent catarrhal inflammations, vicious, septic states. Chronic abscesses, carbuncles, boils, abscesses in the joints, the left hip-joint is a special locality. You will often be able to abort a case of hip-disease, and even when pus is present or fistulous openings have formed it is very useful. Fullness, suppuration, and pain in the cartilages.
Stram. stands alone among the deep acting remedies, in its violence of mental symptoms. Stram. cures eye troubles and irritation of the brain from overstudy; in students who are obliged to do much night work to keep up with day lectures. The patient seems almost blind; there is much pain in the eyes in dim light, relieved in intense light. The mental symptoms, cough, headache, etc., are worse from light.
"Dryness of throat and fauces, not benefited by any sort of drink.
Swallowing difficult and impeded with stinging pain in the throat, with pain in the submaxillary glands with convulsions; particularly fluids from constriction of throat."
Choking on attempting to swallow water. It has done some good work in hydrophobia. (Hyosc., Bell., Canth., Hydroph.)
In old cases of suppuration of the lungs where the cough is worse from looking into the light, Stram. is often a great palliative and causes no aggravation.
Retention of urine, cannot pass it if he ceases to strain; old men who have lost power over the bladder, stream flows slowly, cannot make haste.
Cardiac affections with great constriction of the chest, mental irritability, delusions as to personal identity, inability to sleep in the dark, great anxiety when on a train going through a tunnel, pulse irregular, heart feeble.
Sleep full of dreams and turmoil.
Sulphur
Sulphur is such a full remedy that it is somewhat difficult to tell where to begin.
It seems to contain a likeness of all the sicknesses of man, and a beginner on reading over the proving of Sulphur might naturally think that he would need no other remedy, as the image of all sickness seems to be contained in it.
Yet you will find it will not cure all the sicknesses of man, and it is not well to use it indiscriminately any more than you would any other remedy. It seems that the less a physician knows of the Materia Medica the oftener he gives Sulphur, and yet it is very frequently given, even by good prescribers; so that the line between physicians’ ignorance and knowledge cannot be drawn from the frequency with which Sulphur is prescribed by them.
Aspect: The Sulphur patient is a lean, lank, hungry, dyspeptic fellow with stoop shoulders, yet many times it must be given to fat, rotund, well fed people.
The angular, lean, stoop-shouldered patient, however, is the typical one, and especially when he has become so from long periods of indigestion, bad assimilation and feeble nutrition. The Sulphur state is sometimes brought about by being long housed up and adapting the diet to the stomach.
Persons who lead sedentary lives, confined to their rooms in study, in meditation, in philosophical inquiry, and who take no exercise, soon find out that they must eat only the simplest foods, foods not sufficient to nourish the body, and they end up by going into a philosophical mania.
There is another class of patients in whom we see a Sulphur appearance in the face; dirty, shriveled, red- faced people. The skin seems to be easily affected by the atmosphere. He becomes red in the face from riding in the air, both in very cold and in damp weather.
He has a delicate, thin skin, blushing on the slightest occasion, always red and dirty looking, no matter how much he washes it. If it be a child, the mother may wash the face often, but it always looks as if it had been perfunctorily washed.
Hering called the Sulphur patient "the ragged philosopher."
The Sulphur scholar, the inventor, works day and night in threadbare clothes and battered hat; he has long, uncut hair and a dirty face; his study is uncleanly, it is untidy; books and leaves of books are piled up indiscriminately; there is no order. It seems that Sulfur produces this state of disorder, a state of untidiness, a state of uncleanness, a state of "care how things go,” and a state of selfishness.
He becomes a false philosopher and the more he goes on in this state the more he is disappointed because the world does not consider him the greatest man on earth. Old inventors work and work, and fail.
The complaints that arise in this kind of case, even the acute complaints, will run to Sulphur. You take such a patient and you will notice that he has on a shirt that he has worn many weeks; if he has not a wife to attend to him, he would wear his shirt until it fell off from him.
Cleanliness is not a great idea with the Sulphur patient; he thinks it is not necessary. He is dirty; he does not see the necessity of putting on a clean collar and cuffs and a clean shirt; it does not worry him. Sulphur is seldom indicated in cleanly people, but it is commonly indicated in those who are not disturbed by uncleanliness.
Odor: When attending the public clinic I have many times noticed that after Sulphur an individual begins to take notice of himself and puts on a clean shirt, whereas his earlier appearances were in the one same old shirt. And it is astonishing how the Sulphur patients, especially the little ones, can get their clothing dirty so fast.
Children have the most astonishing tendency to be filthy. Mothers tell you of the filthy things that little ones will do if they be Sulphur patients. The child is subject to catarrhal discharges from the nose, the eyes and from other parts, and he often eats the discharge from the nose. Now, that is peculiar, because offensive odors are the things that the Sulphur patient loathes. He is oversensitive to filthy odors, but filthy substances themselves he will eat and swallow. He becomes nauseated even from the odor of his own body and of his own breath.
The odor of the stool is so offensive that it will follow him around all day. He thinks he can smell it. Because of his sensitiveness to odors he is more cleanly about his bowels than anything else. It is an exaggerated sense of smell. He is always imagining and hunting for offensive odors. He has commonly such a strong imagination that he smells the things which he has only in memory.
The Sulphur patient has filthiness throughout. He is the victim of filthy odors. He has a filthy breath, he has an intensely foetid stool; he has filthy smelling genitals, which can be smelled in the room in spite of his clothing, and he himself smells them. The discharges are always more or less foetid, having strong, offensive odors. In spite of constant washing the axillae give out a pungent odor, and at times the whole body gives off an odor like that coming from the axillae.
Discharges: The discharges of Sulphur from every part of the body, besides being offensive, are excoriating. The Sulfur patient is afflicted with catarrhs of all mucous membranes, and the catarrhal discharges everywhere excoriate him. Often with the coryza the discharge excoriates the lips and the nose.
At times the fluid that remains in the nose smarts like fire, and when it comes in contact with the child's lip it burns, so acrid is it; almost like the condition under Sulphuricum acid, so red will be the parts that are touched by it.
There is copious leucorrhoea that excoriates the genitals. The thin feces cause burning and rawness around the anus. In women if a drop of urine remains about the genitals it will burn; very often it is not sufficient to wipe it away, it must be washed away to relieve the smarting.
In children we find excoriation about the anus and between the buttocks; the whole length of the fissure is red, raw and inflamed from the stool. From this tendency a keynote has been constructed, and not a bad one either, all the fluids burn the parts over which they pass," which is the same as saying that the fluids are acrid and cause smarting. This is true everywhere in Sulphur.
Skin: The Sulphur patient has all sorts of eruptions.
There are vesicular, pustular, furuncular, scaly eruptions, all attended with much itching, and some of them with discharge and suppuration. The skin, even without any eruption, itches much, itches from the warmth of the bed and from wearing woolen clothing.
Many times the Sulphur patient cannot wear anything except silk or cotton. The warmth of the room will drive him to despair if he cannot get at the itching part to scratch it. After scratching there is burning with relief of the itching. After scratching or after getting into the warmth of the bed great white welts come out all over the body, with much itching, and these he keeps on scratching until the skin becomes raw, or until it burns, and then comes a relief of the itching.
This process goes on continuously; dreadful itching at right in bed, and in the morning when he wakes up he starts in again and the eruptions itch and ooze. Crops of boils and little boil-like eruptions come out and this makes it useful in impetigo.
This remedy is useful in suppurations. It establishes all sorts of suppurating cavities, small abscesses and large abscesses; abscesses beneath the skin, in the cellular tissues and in internal organs. The suppurative tendency is very marked in Sulphur. The glands become inflamed and the inflammation goes on to suppuration.
Burning: Wherever there is a Sulphur complaint you will find burning.
Every part burns; burning where there is congestion; burning of the skin or a sensation of heat in the skin; burning here and there in spots; burning in the glands, in the stomach, in the lungs; burning in the bowels, in the rectum; burning and smarting in the hemorrhoids; burning when passing urine, or a sensation of
heat in the bladder. There is heat here and there, but when the patient describes something especially typical of Sulphur she says:
"Burning of the soles of the feet in the palms of the hands, and on the top of the head."
Burning of the soles of the feet will very often be noticed after the patient becomes warm in bed. The Sulphur patient has so much heat and burning of the soles at night in bed that he puts the feet out from, beneath the clothes, sleeps with the feet outside the covering. The soles and palms of the Sulphur patient when examined present a thick skin which burns on becoming warm in bed.
Many complaints come on from becoming warm in bed. The Sulphur patient cannot stand heat and cannot stand cold, though there is a strong craving for the open air. He wants an even temperature; he is disturbed if the temperature changes much.
So far as his breathing is concerned, when he has much distress he wants the doors and windows open. The body, however, he is frequently forced to have covered, but if he is warmly clad he is bothered with the itching and burning of the skin.
Time: As to time aggravations, nightly complaints are a feature.
Headaches begin after evening meal and increase into the night; he cannot get to sleep because of the pain. There is nightly aching and nightly thirst; nightly distress and symptoms of the skin coming on after becoming warm in bed.
"Intermittent periodic neuralgia, worse every 24 hours, generally at 12 A.M. or 12 P.M."
Midday is another time of aggravation of the Sulphur complaints. It has chills at noon, fevers increase at noon, increase of the mental symptoms at noon, headache worse at noon. Complaints that come once a week, a seven-day aggravation, is another peculiar condition of Sulphur.
Diarrhea: it is a common feature for a Sulphur patient to have a peculiar kind of diarrhoea which has been long known as "a Sulphur diarrhoea,” though many other remedies have a similar condition, viz.: diarrhoea coming on early in the morning.
The Sulphur diarrhoea belongs to the time between midnight and morning, but more commonly the time that he begins to think about rising.
The diarrhea drives him out of bed.
It is generally thin, watery; there is not much gushing, and it is not very copious, sometimes quite scanty, sometimes yellow faecal. After this morning stool he has, in many cases, no further trouble till next morning.
There are many people who go on year after year with, this urging to stool driving out of bed in the morning. The patient suffers from pain, griping, uneasiness, and burning soreness through the bowels. The stool burns while it is passing, and all parts that it comes in contact with are made sore and raw, and there is much chafing.
Desires and aversions: The Sulphur patient is very thirsty.
He is always drinking water. He wants much water.
He also speaks of a hungry feeling, a desire for food, but when he comes to the table, he loathes the food, turns away from it, does not want it.
He eats almost nothing, takes only the simplest and lightest things. There is a craving for stimulants, for alcohol, and an aversion to milk and meat; these latter make him sick and he loathes them.
One of the old men invented out of these things the keynote "drinks much and eats little."
This is true under Sulphur, but many other remedies have the same thing. As to the use of keynotes I would impress on you that it is well to gather together all the symptoms with their associations. It will not do to place much dependence on one little symptom, or even on two or three little symptoms. The symptoms of the whole case must be considered and then, if the keynotes and characteristics and everything else cause the remedy to be well rounded out and full, and to look like the whole patient, only then is it suitable.
There is emptiness occurring at 11 o'clock in the forenoon. If there is any time in the whole twenty-four hours that he feels hungry it is at 1 o'clock. It seems as though he cannot wait for his dinner.
There is this also about the Sulphur patient: he is very hungry about his customary mealtimes and, if the meal is delayed, he becomes weak and nauseated. Those that are accustomed to eat at about 12 o'clock will have that all-gone hungry feeling at 1 A.M. Those accustomed to eat about 1 or 1-30 will have it about 12 o'clock. The all-gone sensation is about one hour before the accustomed time of eating with many people.
Ina sort of condensed way a strong Sulphur group is this: an all gone hungry feeling in the stomach at 1 A.M., burning of the soles and heat in the top of the head.
These three things have been looked upon as a sine qua non of Sulphur, but they are scarcely the beginning of Sulphur.
Skin: There is an unhealthy condition of the skin in Sulphur aside from the eruptions.
The skin will not heal. Small wounds continue to suppurate; abscesses formed under the skin become little discharging cavities with fistulous openings, and these leak and discharge for a long time.
Sulphur produces an infiltration in inflamed parts, so that they become indurated and these indurations last for years. When the inflammation is in a vital organ, like the lungs, this infiltration cannot always be endured; it leaves infiltrations after pneumonia called hepatization.
Sulphur produces this same tendency in inflamed parts throughout the body and hence its great use in hepatization.
Sulphur is a very useful remedy when the patient does not react after a prolonged disease, because of a condition in the economy, a psoric condition. When a patient is drawing near the end of an acute disease he becomes weak and prostrated. The inflammatory state ends in suppuration and infiltrations; the patient is in a state of weakness, much fatigued and prostrated, and has night sweats.
He does not convalesce after a typhoid or other acute disease. There is slow repair and a slow, tired economy, and order is not restored after the acute disease. Sulphur often becomes very useful in such conditions. Old drunkards become debilitated and have violent craving for alcohol; they cannot let liquor
alone. They crave strong and pungent things, want nothing to eat, but want cold water and alcoholic drinks, They go on drinking till greatly exhausted and then their complaints come on. Sulphur will for a while take away this craving for drink and build him up.
The tissues seem to take on weakness, so that very little pressure causes soreness, sometimes inflammation and suppuration. Bed sores come on easily in a Sulphur patient, as there is feeble circulation. Induration from pressure is also a strong feature.
Sulphur has corns from pressure, callosities from pressure. These affections come easily. If a shoe presses anywhere on the skin a great corn or bunion develops. Where the teeth come in contact with the tongue and other parts of the buccal cavity nodules form and these little nodules in course of time commence to ulcerate.
It is a slow process with burning and stinging. They may go into cancerous affections. They may be postponed for a long time and afterwards take on a state of malignancy. Cancer is an outgrowth of a state in the body, and that state may come on from a succession of states. It is not one continuous condition, but the malignant state may follow the benign. Sulphur removes these states when the symptoms agree.
We notice a marked evidence of disturbance of the veins under Sulphur. It is a venous remedy, has much vein trouble. The veins seem to be relaxed and there is sluggish circulation. There is a flushed appearance of the face here and there from slight irritation, from the weather, from irritation of the clothing.
Tumefaction of the face. Sulphur has varicose veins; most marked of these are hoemorrhoidal veins, which are enlarged and burn and sting. Varices of the extremities. The veins even ulcerate, rupture and bleed. When going out of a cold into a warm atmosphere the patient suffers from enlarged veins, from puffiness of the hands and feet, from a sense of fullness throughout the body.
The Sulphur patient emaciates, and a peculiar feature is the emaciation of the limbs with distended abdomen. The abdomen is tumid, with rumbling, burning and soreness, and with the distended abdomen there is emaciation of all other parts. The muscles of the neck, back thorax and limbs wither, and the muscles of the abdomen are also wasted, but there is much distension of the abdomen itself. This condition of affairs is found in marasmus.
You will find a similar state under Calcarea; and, in women needing Calcarea, you will notice great enlargement, distension and hardness of the abdomen with shriveling of all other parts of the body.
Under Sulphur there are flashes of heat to the face and head, like those which women have at the climacteric period. The flash of heat in Sulphur begins somewhere in the heart region, generally said to be in the chest, and it feels as if, inside the body, a glow of heat is rising to the face. The face is red, hot and flushed, and finally the heat ends in sweat.
Flashes of heat with sweat and red face; the head is in a glow. Sometimes the patient will describe a feeling as if hot steam were inside the body and gradually rising up, and then she breaks out in a sweat. At times you will see a woman having little shiverings followed by flashes of heat and red splotches in the face, and then she fans vigorously; cannot fan fast enough, and she wants the doors and windows open.
Such is Sulphur as well as Lachesis and many others. When the flashes begin in the chest, about the heart, it is more like Sulphur, but when in the back or in the stomach it is more like Phosphorus.
Among other general aggravations we have an aggravation from standing in Sulphur. All complaints are made worse by standing for a length of time. Standing is the most difficult position for a Sulphur patient,
and there is an aggravation of the confusion of mind, dizziness, the stomach and abdominal symptoms, and a sense of enlargement and fullness of the veins and dragging down in the pelvis in women, from standing. The patient must sit down or keep moving, if on her feet. She can walk fairly well, but is worse when standing quiet.
An aggravation after sleep fits into many of the complaints of Sulphur, but especially those of the mind and sensorium. Most of the, complaints of Sulphur are also worse after eating.
The Sulphur patient is aggravated from, bathing. He dreads a bath. He does not bathe himself and from his state in general he belongs to "the great unwashed." He cannot take a bath without catching "cold."
Children's complaints. Dirty-faced, dirty-skinned little urchins, who are subject to nightly attacks of delirium, who suffer much from, pains in the head, who bad brain troubles, who are threatened with hydrocephalus, who had meningitis, need Sulphur.
Sulphur will clear up the constitutional state when remedies have failed to reach the whole case because they are not deep enough. If the infant does not develop properly, if the bones do not grow, and there is slow closing of the fontanelles, Calcarea carbonica may be the remedy and Sulphur is next in importance for such slow growth.
You would not suppose that the Sulphur patient is so nervous as he is, but he is full of excitement; easily startled by noise, wakens, from sleep in a start as if he had heard a cannon report or seen a "spook."
The Sulphur patient is the victim of much trouble in his sleep. He is very sleepy in the fore part of the night, at times sleeping till 3 A.M., but from that time on he has restless sleep, or does not sleep at all. He dreads daylight, wants to go to sleep again, and when he does sleep he can hardly be aroused, and wants to sleep late in the morning. That is the time he gets his best rest and his soundest sleep. He is much disturbed by dreadful dreams and nightmare.
When the symptoms agree, Sulphur will be found a curative medicine in erysipelas. For erysipelas as a name we have no remedy, but when the patient has erysipelas and his symptoms conform to those of Sulphur, you can cure him with Sulphur.
If you bear that distinction in mind you will be able to see what Homoeopathy means; it treats the patient and not the name that the sickness goes by.
The Sulphur patient is annoyed throughout his economy with surgings of blood here and there surging, with fullness of the head, which we have heretofore described as flashes of heat. It has marked febrile conditions and can be used in acute diseases.
It is one of the natural complements of Aconite, and when Aconite is suitable to the acute exacerbations and removes them, very often Sulphur corresponds to the constitutional state of the patient.
Sulphur is suitable in the most troublesome "scrofulous" complaints in broken-down constitutions and defective assimilation. It has deep seated, ragged ulcers on the lower extremities, indolent ulcers, ulcers that will not granulate. They burn, and the little moisture that oozes out burns the parts round about. It is indicated often in varicose ulcers that bleed easily and burn much.
In old cases of gout, Sulphur is a useful remedy. It is a deep-acting remedy, and in most instances it will keep the gout upon the extremities, as its tendency is outward from centre to circumference.
Like Lycopodium and Calcarea, when suitably administered in old gouty conditions, not where there is much organic change present, it will keep the rheumatic state in the joints and extremities.
Sulphur, like Silicea, is a dangerous medicine to give where there is structural disease in organs that are vital, especially in the lungs.
Sulphur will often heal old fistulous pipes and turn old abscesses into a normal state, so that healthy pus will follow, when it is indicated by the symptoms. It will open abscesses that are very slow, doing nothing, it will reduce inflamed glands that are indurated and about to suppurate, when the symptoms agree.
But it is a dangerous medicine to administer in advanced cases of phthisis, and, if given, it should not be prescribed in. the highest potencies. If there are symptoms that are very painful, and you think that Sulphur must be administered, go to the 30 th or 200 th potency.
Do not undertake to stop the night sweats that come in the advanced stages, even if Sulphur seems to be indicated by the symptoms; the fact is, it is not indicated. A remedy that is dangerous in any case ought not to be considered as indicated, even though the symptoms are similar.
In old cases of syphilis, when, the psoric state is uppermost, Sulphur may be needed. Sulphur is rarely indicated when the syphilitic symptoms are uppermost, but when these have been suppressed by Mercury and the disease is merely held in abeyance, Sulphur will antidote the Mercury and allow the symptoms to develop and the original condition to come back in order to be seen.
The great mischief done by allopaths is due to the fact that they want to cover up everything that is in the economy; they act as if ashamed of everything in the human race; whereas Homoeopathy endeavors to reveal everything in the human rue and to antidote those drugs that cover up, and to free those diseases that are held down.
It is true that many patients will not have Homoeopathy because they do not want their syphilitic eruption brought to view they do not want the evidences of their indiscretion brought to light but Homoeopathy endeavors to do that. Conditions that are in the economy will come out under proper homoeopathic treatment. Sulphur brings complaints to the surface, so that they can be seen. It is a general broad antidote.
Suppressions: It is a medicine often called for in the suppression of eruptions from cold and from drugs, and even from Sulphur. It is a great medicine to develop these things which have been covered tip, hence you will see Sulphur in all the lists of remedies useful for suppressed eruptions or for anything suppressed by drugs.
Even when acute eruptions have been suppressed, Sulphur becomes a valuable remedy. In suppressed gonorrhoea Sulphur is often the remedy to start up the discharge and re-establish the conditions that have been caused to disappear. Symptoms that have been suppressed must return or a cure is not possible.
Sulphur has been the remedy from the beginning of its history, from the time of Hahnemann, and on his recommendation, to be thought of when there is a paucity of symptoms to prescribe on, a latent condition of the symptoms due to psora. In this state it has been administered with so much benefit that the routine prescriber has learned the fact.
When apparently (superficially) well-indicated remedies fail to hold a patient, and symptoms cannot be found for a better remedy, it is true that Sulphur takes a deep hold of the economy and remedies act better after it.
This is well established from experience. You will find at times when you have given a remedy which seems well indicated, that it does not hold the case, and then you give the next best indicated remedy, and then the next, with the same result.
You will begin to wonder why this is, but you will see that, although the case does not call clearly for Sulphur, yet on its administration it so closely conforms to the underlying condition (and psora is so often the underlying condition) that it makes the remedies act better.
This is an observation that has been confirmed since the time of Hahnemann by all the old men.
Such things are only necessary when there is a paucity of symptoms, where after much study it is necessary to resort to what, seem the best measures, measures, justifiable to a certain extent, based upon observation and upon a knowledge of the conditions underlying the constitution of the whole race.
We know that underlying these cases with few symptoms there is a latent condition, and that it is either psora, syphilis or sycosis. If it were known to be syphilis we would select the head of the class of remedies looking like syphilis.
If known to be sycosis, we would select the head of the class of remedies looking like sycosis. Sulphur stands at the head of the list of remedies looking like the underlying psora; and so, if the underlying constitution is known to be psoric, and it is a masked case, Sulphur will open up the latent cause, and, even if it does not act on a positively curative basis, it is true that a better representation of the symptoms comes up. And as Sulphur is to psora, so is Mercurius to syphilis, and Thuja to sycosis.
In the coal regions of Pennsylvania, those who work in the mines and those living in the vicinity of the mines often need Sulphur. We know that the coal is not made up of Sulphur; there is a good deal in it besides; but those who handle the coal often need Sulphur. Persons who are always grinding kaolin and the various products that are used in the manufacture of china, and the workers among stone, especially require Calcarea and Silicea, but those who work in the coal mines often need Sulphur.
The patients look like Sulphur patients; they have the aspect, and even when their symptoms are localized and call for other remedies, you will get no good action from these remedies until you give them a dose of Sulphur, after which they go on improving.
Some believe this is due to the fact that there is so much Sulphur in the coal. We may theorize about these things as much as we have a mind to, but we do not want to fall into the habit of antidoting the lower potencies with the high.
Only use that method as a dernier ressort. When there are no symptoms to indicate the remedy, then it is time for us to experiment, and then it is justifiable only when it is carried on by a man of the right sort, because such a man keeps within the limit. He knows how to give his remedy. Such a man is guided by the symptoms in each case so far as symptoms speak out.
In inflammatory conditions a purplish appearance of the inflamed parts, a venous engorgement, is seen under Sulphur.
Measles, when they come out with that purplish color, very often require Sulphur.
Sulphur is a great remedy in measles.
The routinist can do pretty well in this disease with Pulsatilla and Sulphur, occasionally requiring Aconite and Euphrasia. Especially will Sulphur modify the case when the skin is dusky and the measles do not come out. This purplish color may be seen anywhere, in the erysipelas, in the sore throat, often on the forearms, legs and face.
The dreadful effects of vaccination are often cured by Sulphur. In this it competes with Thuja and Malandrinum.
Mind: In the mental state, which gives out the real man, shows forth the real interior nature, we see that Sulphur vitiates his affections, driving him to a most marked state of selfishness.
He has no thought of anybody's wishes or desires but his own. Everything that he contemplates is for the benefit of himself. This selfishness runs through the Sulphur patient. There is absence of gratitude.
Philosophical mania is also a prominent feature. Monomania over the study of strange and abstract things, occult things; things that are beyond knowledge; studying different things without any basis to figure upon; dwelling upon strange and peculiar things.
Sulphur has cured this consecutive tracing one thing to another as to first cause. It has cured a patient who did nothing but meditate as to what caused this and that and the other thing, finally tracing things back to Divine Providence, and then asking:
"Who made God?"
She would sit in a corner counting pins and wonder, pondering over the insolvable question of "Who made God?"
One woman could never see any handiwork of man without asking who made it. She could never be contented until she found out the man who made it, and then she wanted to know who his father was; she would sit down and wonder who he was, whether he was an Irishman, and so on.
That is a feature of Sulphur. It is that kind of reasoning without any hope of discovery, without any possible answer. It is not that kind of philosophy which has a basis and which can be followed up, reasoning in a series, reasoning on things that are true, but a fanatical kind of philosophy that has no basis, wearing oneself out.
Sulphur has an aversion to follow up things in an orderly fashion, an aversion to real work, an aversion to systematic work. The Sulphur patient is a sort of inventive genius. When he gets an idea in his mind he is unable to get rid of it.
He follows it and follows it until finally accidentally be drops into some thing, and many times that is how things are invented. Such is a Sulphur patient. He is often ignorant but imagines himself to be a great man; he despises education and despises literary men and their accomplishments, and he wonders why it is everyone cannot see that he is above education. Again, this patient takes on religious melancholy, not meditating upon the rational religion, but on foolish ideas about himself. He prays constantly and uninterruptedly, is always in his room, moaning with despair. He thinks he has sinned away his day of grace.
A patient needing Sulphur is often in a state of dullness and confusion of mind, with inability to collect the thoughts and ideas; lack of concentration. He will sit and meditate on no one thing continuously, making no effort to concentrate his mind upon anything. He wakes up in the morning with dullness of mind and
fullness in the head and vertigo. Vertigo in the open air. In the open air comes on coryza with this fullness in the head and dullness, so that there is a confusion of the mind.
In the books there is an expression that has been extensively used. "Foolish happiness and pride; thinks himself in possession of beautiful things; even rags seem beautiful.”
Such a state has been present in lunatics, and in persons who were not lunatics in any other way except on that one idea.
The Sulphur patient has an aversion to business. He will sit around and do nothing, and let his wife take in washing and "work her fingernails off" taking care of him; he thinks that is all she is good for.
A state of refinement seems to have gone out of the Sulphur patient. Sulphur is the very opposite of all things fastidious. Arsenicum is the typical fastidious patient, and these two remedies are the extremes of each other. Arsenicum wants his clothing neat and clean, wants everything hung up well upon the pegs, wants all the pictures hung up properly upon the wall, wants everything neat and nice; and hence the Arsenicum patient has been called "the gold-headed-cane patient,” because of his neatness, fastidiousness and cleanliness.
The very opposite of all that is the Sulphur patient.
"Indisposed to everything, work, pleasure, talking or motion; indolence of mind and body."
"Satiety of life; longing for indolence of mind and body."
"Satiety of life; longing for death."
"Too lazy to rouse himself up, and too unhappy to live."
"Dread of being washed (in children)."
Yes, they will cry lustily if they have to be washed. The Sulphur patient dreads water and takes cold from bathing.
As to its relationship, Sulphur should not be given immediately before Lycopodium. It belongs to a rotating group, Sulphur, Calcarea, Lycopodium.
First Sulphur, then Calcarea and then Lycopodium, and then Sulphur again, as it follows Lycopodium well. Sulphur and Arsenicum are also related.
You will very often treat a case with Sulphur for a while and then need to give Arsenicum for some time, and then back to Sulphur. Sulphur follows most of the acute remedies well.
The Sulphur patient is troubled is with much dizziness. When he goes into the open air or when he stands any length of time, he becomes dizzy. On rising in the morning his head feels stupid, and on getting on his feet he is dizzy.
He feels stupid and tired, and not rested by his sleep, and "things go round." It takes some time to establish an equilibrium. He is slow in gathering himself together after sleep. Here we see the aggravation from sleep and from standing.
Head: The head furnishes many symptoms.
The Sulphur patient is subject to periodical sick headaches; congestive headaches, a sensation of great congestion with stupefaction, attended with nausea and vomiting. Sick headache once a week or every two weeks, the characteristic seven-day aggravation.
Most headaches coming on Sunday in working men are cured by Sulphur. You can figure this out. Sunday is the only day he does not work, and he sleeps late in the morning and gets up with a headache that involves the whole head, with dullness and congestion. Being busy and active prevents the headache during the week.
Others have periodical headaches every seven to ten days, with nausea and vomiting of bile. Again he may have a headache lasting two or three days; a congestive headache. Headache with nausea and no vomiting or headache with vomiting of bile. The headache is aggravated by stooping, generally ameliorated in a warm room and by the application of warmth; aggravated from light, hence the desire to close the eyes and to go into dark room; aggravated by jarring, and after eating.
The whole head is sensitive and the eyes are red, and there is often lachrymation, with nausea and vomiting. Headaches at times in those who suffer constantly from great heat in the vertex; the top of the head is hot and burns and he wants cold cloths applied to the top of the head. These headaches associated with heat are often ameliorated by cold, but otherwise the head is ameliorated in a warm room.
The head feels stupid and sometimes he cannot think. Every motion aggravates and he is worse after eating and drinking, worse from taking cold drinks into the stomach and better from hot drinks. When the headaches are present the face is engorged; bright red face. Headaches in persons who have a red face, a dirty face or sallow, a venous stasis of the face; the eyes are engorged and the skin is engorged; the face is puffed and venous in appearance.
Sulphur is useful in persons who get up in the morning with headache, dizziness and red face; in persons who say they know they are going to have the headache some time during the day because the face feels very full and is red in the morning, and the eyes are red.
Before the headache comes on there is a flickering before the eyes, a flickering of color. Scintillations, stars, saw teeth, zig-zags are forewarnings of a headache. Some Sulphur headaches that I have known present a peculiar appearance before the eyes; a rhomboidal figure, obliquely placed, with saw teeth on the upper side and the body filled with spots.
Sometimes this figure is seen toward one side of the object looked at, sometimes on the other side, but it is seen equally distinct with both eyes at the same time.
These saw teeth are flashes of light, and the base of the figure grows increasingly darker until you get all the colors of the rainbow. Whenever he disorders his stomach he has this peculiar vision. Sometimes it comes in the morning after eating and sometimes at noon after eating. It comes also when be is hungry in the evening and delays his eating. These zig-zags come very often with that hungry all-gone feeling in the stomach.
We have the same state of affairs, similar appearance of zig-zags and flickerings in both Natrum muriaticum and Psorinum before the headache. They are warning of headaches. These zig-zags, flickerings, sparks, stars and irregular shapes appear before the eye periodically, and may last an hour or so. In the head there is much throbbing. Morning headaches and headaches coming on at noon. Headaches also, as mentioned before that begin after the -evening meal and increase into the night, hindering sleep.
Scalp: Upon the external head the itching is indescribable; constant itching, itching when warm in bed. It is worse from the warmth of the bed and yet it is also worse from cold. itching eruptions; scaly, moist and dry eruptions; vesicles, pimples, pustules and boils; eruptions in general upon the scalp. Much dandruff in
the hair, and loss of hair There is slow closing of the fontanelles.
"Humid, offensive eruption on top of the head, filled with pus, drying up into honey like scabs. Tinea capitis."
"Humid offensive eruption with thick pus, yellow crusts, bleeding and burning."
Hair dry, falling off, etc.
It has many symptoms, such as in olden times would be called scrofulous, but which we recognize as psoric. There is a tendency for every "cold" to settle in the eyes. Discharge of mucus and pus from the eyes.
Ulceration and thickening of the eyelids, lids rolled outwards or inwards, loss of eyelashes; red and disturbed condition.
Eyes: Now, if we would say "complaints of the eyes in a Sulphur patient," it would cover all kinds of eye troubles.
Sulphur has extensive eye symptoms. Eye symptoms with eruptions on the face and scalp, with itching of the skin, especially when warm in bed. Catarrhal eye symptoms that are made worse from washing.
When not only the eyes are aggravated by bathing, but the patient himself is aggravated from bathing and he dreads to bathe, and he has itching which is made worse from the warmth of the bed, and is subject to chronic sick headaches and has heat on top of the head, with such concomitants his eyes symptoms, no matter what will be cured by Sulphur. Sulphur has cured, cataract and iritis, inflammatory conditions and opacities, and all sorts of "hallucinations of sight" (coming with headaches)
"Flickering before the eyes" (as described)
"small dark specks; dark points and spots; black flies seem to float not far from the eyes; gas or lamp light seems to be surrounded with a halo," etc.
There are so many of these peculiar images before the eyes, but all have the Sulphur constitution. "Burning heat in the eyes, painful smarting."
Every "cold" settles in the eyes, i. e,, the eye symptoms, when present, are increased and, when he has no eye symptoms, these are brought on from every "cold."
Ears: The ears are subject to catarrh.
You have learned in the generals, that the catarrhal state is a very strong feature of Sulphur. No mucous membrane of the body escapes, all have catarrhal discharges, copious, sometimes purulent, sometimes bloody. The eyes and ears are no exception.
The catarrhal state goes on in a patient until deafness follows. Thickening of the mucous membrane and of the drum. All sorts of strange noises in the ear until the hearing is lost. After structural changes have taken place and deafness comes on even if there is no cure for the deafness, you may cure the patient.
When a patient wants to know if he can be cured of his deafness you can never tell him. Many of the troubles are in the middle ear, and as you cannot examine it, you do not know how much structural change has taken place. You can only say that if the patient can be sufficiently cured then it can be ascertained. If the structural changes are not very great they will disappear after the patient is cured.
If the internal parts are destroyed, if there is a dry, atrophic catarrh of the middle ear, you can hardly expect to restore that middle ear. It has been destroyed; the parts that are necessary for sensation no longer register sensation, because they have become atrophied. You can only talk to the patient about the prospects of curing him.
Do not entertain in your mind the idea of curing an organ. Keep that idea out of your mind as much as possible, and, when people want you to locate the disease in organs, keep quiet, because only the patient is sick,
Think as much as possible about the sick patient and as little as possible about the name or the pathological conditions of organs. So, when patients say,
"Doctor, can you cure my hearing?” answer them: "First, you must be cured. The first and most important thing is to cure you."
Cure the patient and then it will be seen afterwards what can be done for the ear, for the hearing. That keeps your mind in proper form, keeps you in right relation to the patient. If you were all the time talking of the ear, the patient would worry your life out about his ear.
"When are you going to do something for ear? When am I going to hear?"
Start out with the understanding that the whole patient is to be treated. Remember the patient first, and let him understand that. The idea of a patient going to a specialist for diseases of the ears should be discouraged unless a homoeopathist is at hand.
It is a disease of the whole body that is to be treated. There is no such trouble as an ear trouble considered apart from the constitutional state of the patient himself. Sulphur has "frequent stoppages of the ears, especially when eating or blowing one's nose."
"Sounds in ears." Inflarnmation of various kinds. Discharges from the ears in a Sulphur patient.
You see I have avoided saying that Sulphur is a remedy for the ears. Many times you will cure patients of these "local diseases" if you select remedies for the patients, when the local symptoms would never have led you to the remedy.
You would never have thought of Sulphur for the ear alone, or for the prolapsus of the uterus, yet the patient needs Sulphur, and, having given it, you are astonished to see how the organs are turned into order after the constitution of the patient has been made orderly.
Now and then pains that are located here and there in the body are prescribed at by the physician, and failure follows. He hunts a remedy through and through to find some particular kind of pain that resembles the pain which the patient has. You should treat the patient and not bother about trifling pains.
Leave it out if you want to, but get a remedy for the patient. If that pain is in the remedy well and good, but if not do not bother about it. Do not bother about the little symptoms. You may even leave out a most prominent keynote in treating the patient.
Sometimes that particular pain is the only symptom the patient wants cured, but if it is an old symptom, it will be the last thing to go away. Under such circumstances the patient will bother your life out wanting to know when that pain is going to be cured, but if you have knowledge of the matter you will not expect to relieve that pain the first time; if you do relieve it you know that you have made a mistake, for the later symptoms should all go away first.
It is sometimes necessary, in order to hold a patient, to say,
"That symptom must not be cured first, but these little symptoms that you do not care much about will go away first."
You will hold that patient for life simply because you have told the truth, simply because you have exhibited to her that you know. Such business is honestly acquired business.
Nose: The catarrhal affections of the nose are extremely troublesome in Sulphur.
"Smell before the nose as of an old catarrh,” and so troublesome is the Sulphur nose, so troublesome is this catarrhal state that with odors he is made sick. He thinks he smells his own catarrh, and thinks others also smell it. The smell of this old catarrh, or of filthy things, keeps him nauseated. He is subject to coryzas; constant sneezing, stoppage of the nose. Under coryza we read "fluent like water trickling from the nose."
All the nasal discharges are acrid and burning.
This is a state in Sulphur. Every time he takes "cold," it brings on a coryza. He cannot take a bath, he cannot become overheated, he cannot get into a cold place and cannot overexert himself without getting this "cold in the nose."
Changes of the weather establish a new attack, I have observed in numbers of those old people who are in the habit of taking large quantities of Sulphur in the spring for boils, and as a spring cleanser, that for the rest of the year they suffer from coryza and the various complaints of Sulphur.
If you can hunt out some of these old Sulphur takers, you will have a very good picture of Sulphur, interesting for the homeopathic physician to look upon. He is also subject to nose-bleed, dry ulcers and scabs in the nose.
Face: I have quite sufficiently described the general aspect of the face in Sulphur, but we must especially remember the venous stasis, the dirty appearance, the red spots, the sickly look, the appearance of false plethora. It is a face that changes from pale to red, a pallid face that becomes easily disturbed, flushed from
excitement, flushed in a warm room, flushed from slight stimulation, especially flushed in the morning. Eruptions upon the face.
Periodical neuralgias of the most violent character, especially on the right side of the face. Long and tedious right-sided neuralgias. Persistent neuralgias in those that live in a malarial climate, when the short-acting remedies given for the neuralgia, such as Belladonna and Nux vomica, have only for a short time mitigated the suffering. If upon studying the whole case you find he turns out to be a Sulphur patient, Sulphur will permanently cure the neuralgia.
Sulphur cures erysipelatous inflammation of the face. In Sulphur the erysipelas commences on the right side of the face and about the right ear, and there is considerable swelling of the right car, and it spreads slowly, moves with sluggishness and is unusually purple. The whole patient is an offensive, filthy patient; in spite of washing, his skin looks wrinkled, shriveled and like dried beef.
Sulphur is not so suitable in the cases that come on with rapidity and great violence, with vesicles and enormous blebs, but it suits those cases in which at first there is the appearance of a mottled dusky red spot on the face, and a little distance from it another spot and the another, and these, as it were, all run together, and after a week or so it develops into a sluggish erysipelatous state, and the veins seem to be distended, and he is passing into a state toward unconsciousness.
You will be astonished to see what Sulphur will do in such a case, which comes slowly as if there were a lack of vitality to develop it, a slow, sluggish, erysipelatous inflammation. Whereas, if it be Arsenicum, Apis or Rhus tox, it spreads with rapidity. Arsenicum and Apis burn like, fire and Rhus has blisters upon the erysipelatous patches.
The whole face in Sulphur is covered at times with patches of moist, scaly, itching, eczematous eruptions. Crusta lactea that involves the scalp and the cars, with moisture, thick yellow crusts, piling up, with much itching, which is worse when warm in bed. The child sleeps without covers. If there is itching in parts that are covered, when the parts become warm the itching increases. These eruptions are associated with eye diseases, catarrhal affections of the eyes and nose.
The Sulphur patient has thick incrustations upon the lips, scabby lips, chapped lips, cracks about the lips and corners of the mouth. The saliva oozes out of the mouth making red streaks. Eruptions with itching and burning about the lower part of the face. Herpetic eruptions about the mouth. All of these burn and become excoriated from the fluids of the mouth. Round about the under jaw there is swelling of the glands. Swelling and suppuration of the sub-maxillary glands swelling of the parotids. The glands of the neck are enlarged.
Teeth and Mouth: In the Sulphur constitution the teeth become loose; the gums settle away from the teeth and bleed and burn.
The teeth decay. There is a general unhealthy condition of the mouth and tongue. Foul taste and foul tongue. Ulceration of the mouth and burning in the ulcers. In the aphthae there is burning, stinging. White patches in the mouth.
Sulphur is a very useful remedy in sore mouth of nursing infants, and such as occurs in the mother during lactation. It has also deep-seated phagedenic ulcers that eat around the inner surface of the check. Peculiar little nodules form upon the tongue. and upon the sides of the mouth where the unhealthy teeth press.
When these nodules come along the edge of the tongue they are so painful that he cannot talk and cannot swallow. He must live on substances that he can take without having to move the tongue. Sometimes they involve the whole tongue, and have been called cancerous affections even when benign.
Throat: Sulphur is a wonderful medicine for chronic sore throat when the symptoms agree.
The old Sulphur patient suffers from a general catarrhal state, as has been said, and the throat symptoms are of that sort. There is a catarrhal state which goes on even to ulceration. The tonsil is enlarged, and of a purplish aspect lasting for weeks and months, a general sore and painfully sensitive condition of the throat; but it has also an acute sore throat. It is especially useful in inflammation of the tonsil with suppuration, when the aspect is purplish, venous, and not a bright red inflammation.
The purplish, dusky color is especially a Sulphur color. There is often burning in the throat, stitching, rawness, smarting, inflammation and difficult swallowing. It has cured diphtheria.
I have sufficiently covered appetite, desires and aversions under the generals. The Sulphur patients are commonly dyspeptics, patients who can digest almost nothing. They must live on the simplest forms of food in order to have any comfort at all; cannot digest anything like ordinary diet.
The stomach: is sensitive to touch with the all-gone hungry feeling before mealtimes.
The Sulphur patient cannot go long without eating; he becomes. faint and weak. Great heaviness in the stomach after eating but little, after eating meat, or after eating foods that require a healthy stomach to digest.
Then he becomes the victim of pain. He will describe the pains in his stomach as burning pains and great soreness; he has a morbid feeling in the stomach; smarting, and rawness in the stomach. He will describe this sensation as
"Pain in the stomach after eating. Sensation of weight in the stomach after eating," etc.
The Sulphur stomach is a weak stomach, is slow in digesting. There is acid and bilious vomiting, as a result of the disordered stomach. Sour taste in the mouth from the welling up of acids from the stomach.
The liver: is a very troublesome organ.
There is enlargement and induration, with much painfulness, pressure and distress. With congestion of the liver, the stomach also takes on its usual symptoms, or, if present already, they are aggravated. The patient becomes jaundiced, with sensation of engorgement or fullness of the liver, dull aching in the liver.
He is subject to gall stones; tearing pains in the region of the gall duct, coming periodically, attended with much increase of his sallowness.
The Sulphur liver patient is the victim. of chronic sallowness, which increases and decreases. When this patient takes "cold" it settles in the liver; every "cold," every bath he takes, every change of weather, aggravates his liver symptoms, and when these are worse he has less of other troubles. It localizes itself in attacks of bilious vomiting, in attacks of "bilious headaches,” as he calls them.
At times the stool is black as tar, at others it is green and thick, and there are times when the stool is white. These stools alternate and change about with the engorgement of his liver, and then he is subject to gall stones.
Abdomen: The Sulphur patient suffers from great distension of the abdomen; rolling in the abdomen; soreness in the abdomen.
He cannot stand because the abdominal viscera hang down so; they seem to be falling. There is rawness, soreness, distension and burning, with diarrhoea with chronic diarrhoea, and then this goes on to more serious trouble, towards tubercle in the abdomen. The mesenteric glands become in filtrated with tubercle. There is nightly itching with the eruptions upon the abdomen, the itching being worse when warm in bed. Shingles come out about the sides and seem inclined to encircle the body.
He is also a flatulent patient. There is much belching, much distension, much rumbling and passing of flatus. He has spells of colic without being flatulent; the wind is confined. Dreadful spells of colic, cutting, tearing pains relieved in no position; burning and smarting in the whole abdomen and soreness of the intestines.
Catarrh of the whole intestinal tract. That which he vomits is acid and smarts the mouth, and that which he passes by the anus is acrid and makes the parts raw. The liquid stool burns while it is passing, and there is
much burning when passing moist flatus. He is often called to stool, but while sitting at stool he passes only a little fluid or a little moisture with flatus, and that fluid burns like coals of fire, and the anus becomes raw.
The stool may be thin faeces, yellow, watery, mucous, green, bloody, excoriating. The stool is offensive, often sickening, of a penetrating odor which permeates the room, and "the smell of the stool follows, him around, as if he had soiled himself."
The diarrhea comes on especially in the morning and it is commonly limited to the forenoon. It drives him out of bed in the morning; as soon as he wakes up and moves in bed, he feels the urging to stool and must make great haste, or he will lose it; it is with difficulty that he can hold it until he reaches the commode.
The morning is the typical time, but a diarrhea that comes on any time after midnight, from midnight till noon, may be a Sulphur diarrhea. Very seldom would you -expect to cure with Sulphur a diarrhea that is in the habit of coming on during the afternoon. Sulphur has some evening aggravations in diarrhea, but these are exceptions; it is the morning diarrhoea that we look to Sulphur to cure.
Sulphur is a wonderful remedy in cholera and in those cases of diarrhea that occur in cholera times, when the diarrhoea begins in the morning. It is also of great value in dysentery, when the stool is bloody mucus with constant straining. As in Mercurius he must sit long at stool because of a feeling as if he could not finish. Such is the typical Mercurius state: a slimy stool with the sensation as if he could not finish.
Sulphur often cures this state after Mercurius fails. It is the natural follower of Mercurius when the latter has been misunderstood and given. In dysentery, when this tenesmus is of the most violent character, when the stool is pure blood, when it is attended also with much urging to urinate.
Mercurius corrosivus gives the quickest relief. If the tenesmus is less violent, and there is not much straining to urinate, or it is altogether absent, Mercurius solubilis is the more natural remedy. These medicines run very close to Sulphur in dysentery, but are more commonly indicated than Sulphur. In Sulphur patients of course Sulphur will be the suitable remedy in dysentery.
He is subject to hemorrhoids, external and internal; great bunches that are sore and raw, burning and tender, and that bleed and smart with the liquid stool.
The urinary symptoms: and those of the bladder and male sexual organs, combine to give a very important group in Sulphur.
There is a catarrhal state of the bladder, constant urging to urinate and burning and smarting while urinating. The urine scalds the urethra while passing and the smarting is so great that it lasts a long time after urination. It is indicated in broken-down constitutions, in old inventors, in old philosophers who have been leading sedentary lives, who suffer from enlarged prostate. burning in the urethra during and after the flow of urine, and a urethral discharge not unlike gonorrhoea, but really a chronic catarrhal state.
Mucus in the urine, sometimes a pus. In old cases of gleet, in old broken-down patients, when the ordinary gonorrhoea remedies, and the remedies especially fitted to the discharge itself, only palliate; when the patient himself is a Sulphur patient.
Such a patient has had a gonorrhoea and has been treated by remedies adapted to the new appearance, to the discharge itself, but a catarrhal state of the urethra follows, with burning in the urethra, swelling of the meatus, a red, swollen, pouty condition of the meatus, and only a drop collects, just enough to soil the linen, and this keeps up week after week, and sometimes for years; he will be cured of this discharge by allowing potentized Sulphur to act long enough.
Sulphur has cured patients with sugar in the urine, in the early stage of diabetes. Sulphur cures involuntary urination during sleep. It cures troubles brought on by taking "cold." Every "cold" in some patients settles in the bladder. This is like Dulcamara, and when Dulcamara will no longer hold, or when it has been suitable in earlier stages, Sulphur follows it well. Continuous smarting of urine and frequent urging; burning, stinging, smarting in the urethra for a long time after micturition.
Genitals: On the genitals there are many eruptions.
Itching of the genitals, worse from warmth of the bed; much sweat about the genitals; coldness of the genitals. In the male, impotency; the sexual desire is fairly strong, but he is unable to secure suitable erections; or there is discharge of semen before intromission, or too soon after intromission. There is an inflammatory condition around the glans and foreskin. Herpetic eruptions under the foreskin, itching and burning. This patient has much annoyance from itching eruptions on the genitals.
The prepuce becomes narrow and cannot be drawn back inflammatory phimosis; thickening or restriction of the prepuce. Inflammatory phimosis can be cured by remedies, if the phimosis depends upon some, trouble that is in itself curable. Congenital phimosis cannot be cured by remedies. The genitals are extremely offensive both to the patient and to the examining physician. The patient is likely to be very uncleanly; he does not bathe himself, and the genitals accumulate their natural filth. Discharge of prostatic fluid when at stool.
Under female sexual, organs we have sterility. We have irregularity in the menstrual flow, menstrual flow suppressed from the slightest disturbance. Haemorrhage in connection with the menstrual flow; uterine haemorrhage; prolonged uterine haemorrhage.
In an abortion you may have selected Belladonna, which war, suitable while the woman was aborting, and it may have overcome the present state; or you may have selected Apis or Sabina, which was suitable for the early state, and it either postpones or checks the haemorrhage for the time or hurries the expulsion of the
foetus; but the haemorrhage starts in again and with its return we have prolonged tribulation. In many of these cases we can do nothing until we put the patient on Sulphur.
If the symptoms are masked, Sulphur stands very high. When Belladonna has been given you will often have to follow it with Sulphur. Sabina, which has the most violent gushing haemorrhage in abortions, very commonly needs to be followed by Sulphur. In such hemorrhagic affections, however i.e, in a prolonged recurring haemorrhage, a chronic condition, not in the first or most exciting time, not in the time of the earliest gushing, there are two very frequently indicated remedies, M.: Sulphur and Psorinum.
The flow keeps coming back in spite of ordinary remedies, and in spite of remedies selected upon the group of symptoms related to the pelvis. In many instances we go to a haemorrhage and the pelvic symptoms are prominent and all other symptoms clouded; there is a gushing flow, the blood is hot, etc., and there are only a few symptoms; but the next time you see the woman she is quiet enough to give other symptoms, and in the course of a few days more symptoms come out, as the hemorrhagic state is an outcome of the chronic condition.
This is unlike measles. You do not have to look into the chronic state until the measles or scarlet fever or small-pox is finished; these are acute miasms. But the haemorrhage is a part of her constitutional state; it is not a miasm; and hence when it is violent, calling for a remedy, probably the best adapted will he the short acting remedies, such as Belladonna or even Aconite; but then look into the constitutional state for it is likely some remedy will have to follow the Aconite or the Belladonna, and commonly it is Sulphur; the acute remedy being suitable to the violent action and then followed by its complementary medicine.
Women needing Sulphur are full of hot flashes, such as they are likely to have at the climateric period, and here it competes with Lachesis and Sepia. Sulphur and Sepia are suitable in the most violent cases of dysmenorrhoea in girls and even in those of advanced age.
Most violent cases that have existed a long time, since the beginning of menstruation, in women who always needed Sulphur. If you select a remedy merely on the kind of pain, on the sensitiveness of the uterus, on the appearance of the flow, i.e., on the pelvic symptoms, you will make a failure. You must treat the patient, even if the pelvic symptoms do not fall under the generals; when the generals agree Sulphur will cure dysmenorrhoea even though you cannot fit it to the pelvic symptoms. The generals always precede and rule in every case.
Sulphur has violent burning in the vagina. Troublesome itching of the vulva. Great offensiveness from the genitals. Perspiration copious and foetid coming from about the genitals, down the inside of the thighs and up over the abdomen.
She is so offensive that the odors nauseate her, and this general state is true, it is not the imagination. Remember the over-sensitiveness to odors. Leucorrhoea copious, offensive, burning, sticky; it may be whitish or yellow; it is offensive, acrid, and causes itching about the part and excoriation.
There is much nausea during gestation, or only during the early period of gestation. In those women needing Sulphur, it will stop the nausea, and they will go into labor easily, with few protracted pains; they will go through their labor with only the contractions, and these comparatively painless. The only pains in such cases will be those from the pressure of the child's head. Labor is painful we know, but it is comparatively easy when the woman is upon a suitable remedy. Sulphur is indicated then in women who have suffered from the most dreadful agony in confinement; prolonged labor. Troublesome after-pains. Suitable also in swelling of the mammary glands.
Then we have septicemic conditions, with purulent lochia or suppression of the lochia. You may go to a case in which, on the third day, there has been a chill, the lochia has been suppressed, the woman has a high temperature and is covered from head to foot with sweat. As you put your hand under the covers you feel steam come up from the body so that you want to take your hand away, it is so hot. She is dazed and is sensitive over the whole abdomen.
You know now the meaning of the suppression of the lochia; you have a puerperal fever on hand. Study closely for Sulphur instead of hunting around among Aconite, Bryonia, Belladonna, Opium, etc. With these you will make a total failure in most instances, but Sulphur fits into just such a state and has cured many cases of puerperal fever.
If it is but a milk fever or mammary indisposition and the chill is only acute, then your short-acting remedies will do very well and even Aconite has been useful, but when it is a case of septicemia, Sulphur goes to the very root of it. When the feet burp, when there is a hungry feeling in the stomach, the night aggravation with sinking and exhaustion, and when throughout the body there is a sensation of steam rising or hot flashes, one after another, you must give Sulphur.
Now, on the other hand, if in such a case, with the hot sweat and other general features, you have one rigor following another in rapid succession and no end to them, you cannot get out of that case without Lycopodium, which goes as deeply into the case as Sulphur. When there is a continuous intermingling of little chillinesses and little quiverings throughout the body and the pulse has lost its proper relationship to the temperature, Pyrogen must be administered. If there is a purplish appearance of the body, cold sweat all over, if there are remittent or intermit-tent chills, with thirst during -the chill, and at no other time, and the face is red during the chill, you must give Ferrum, as no other remedy looks just like that.
When one side of the body is hot and the other side is cold and you find the woman in a tearful state, trembling with fear, nervous excitement and restlessness, give Pulsatilla, which also has a septic state and is sufficient to overcome the septic condition.
Sulphur is suitable in surgical fever when it takes this form of flashes of heat and steaming sweat. In these deep-seated septic states, somewhere from beginning to end, Sulphur will most likely be wanted. You may see in the earlier stages of that septic state a number of Bryonia symptoms, but Bryonia cannot take hold of that case. Remember that in a septic state you want to get ahead of it in the first twenty-four hours; you do not want to let it run on, and if Bryonia has only mitigated it in its beginning then it is too late for Sulphur.
Go to Sulphur at once. Now, another thing, even if you have made a mistake in giving Sulphur and you find it does not take hold of the case, it always simplifies it, does good and never spoils it. It gives you a good basis to begin on. It goes to the bottom and simplifies the matter, and, if you have mental and nervous symptoms left still you have overcome that violent septic state which must be met at once, and the remaining symptoms in many instances are simple. Sulphur is a general remedy to begin with in those cases where the symptoms are not perfectly clear for another.
Respiration: This remedy is full of difficult breathing, shortness of breath from very little exertion, copious sweat, so exhausted; asthmatic breathing and much rattling in the chest.
Every time he gets "cold" it settles in the chest or in the nose. In both these instances the catarrhal state hangs on and holds a long time; it seems never to be finished, always remains as a catarrhal state.
"Every cold he takes ends in asthma," calls for Dulcamara, but very often the fag end of that attack will remain and the physician has to give a deep-acting remedy. After Dulcamara has done all it can do, Sulphur comes in as its complementary remedy. Calcarea carb. has a similar relationship to Dulcamara.
The nose, the inner chest and lungs furnish us localities for much trouble. The patient has had pneumonia and it has gone on to the period of infiltration; you have taken the case in this advanced stage after Bryonia has overcome the threatening features, and now when the patient should rally he does not rally; he perspires all over, is tired and has a strange and singular consciousness that "there is something wrong in there; a load in there;” "difficult breathing; flashes of heat and yet not much fever; sometimes coldness alternating with flashes of heat. I have often heard them say, "
There is a great load in there, doctor. I cannot get rid of it."
Upon close examination you find there is hepatization and now comes the time for such remedies as Phosphorus, Lycopodium and Sulphur, and Sulphur leads them all.
When Bryonia has been sufficient for the earlier symptoms, or when Aconite has cleared them up, there has been too much for these remedies to relieve, then hepatization comes on. If this is confined to only a small area it will keep up quite a chronic course, but Sulphur will clear it up. If, however, it is a double pneumonia, or the hepatization involves a considerable portion of the lung, and the remedy given has not been sufficient, and the case is advancing towards a fatal issue, it may be that all at once at one, two or three o'clock in the morning, he begins to sink, his nose becomes pinched, his lips are drawn, he takes on a hippocratic countenance, is covered with cold sweat, be is too feeble in every part of his body to move; he only moves his head a little in a restless manner.
Unless you are called at once and give him a dose of Arsenicum he will die. You give the Arsenicum, and you have done well, but Arsenicum has no ability to remove the results of inflammation. But though it cannot cure that hepatized lung it acts as a vital stimulant; it warms up the patient and makes him feel he is going to get better; but, mark this, in twenty four hours he will die unless you follow the Arsenicum with the proper remedy.
You must not wait on your remedy too long in these cases. Just as soon as he rallies and the reaction is at its highest pitch, give him the antidote and natural follower of Arsenicum, which is Sulphur, and in twenty- four hours the patient will say,
"lam getting better."
As sure as you exist today, it will do just that thing. There are times when you will see clearly that Phosphorus is the medicine to follow Arsenicum with. If such a patient, rallying under Arsenicum, goes into a fever, if a hot fever comes on with burning thirst and he cannot get enough ice-cold water, you must follow it with Phosphorus, and it will do in that case what Sulphur will do in the other.
You will not see these cases in your own practice because you will not let your cases get into that state; if such cases have power enough to live when prescribed for properly in that state, they have power enough to let you break up the whole nature of the case in the beginning
But go back to that patient who had only a circumscribed hepatization and felt well enough to get up and go around. He has a lingering cough, and now six months or a year after the attack he says.
"Doctor, I have never been right since I had an attack of chest trouble. The doctor called it pneumonia."
He can tell you about the rusty sputum and the other little things that belong to pneumonia; that is all you need to know. He has had a chronic cough ever since that attack and now he has chilliness.
There is fibrinous infiltration, not a tuberculous state, but the remains of hepatization that nature could not cure. If that is allowed to go on be will go into catarrhal phthisis, asthmatic conditions of chronic bronchitis and troubles of various sorts, and finally he will die from these. Sulphur will very often conform to all of his
symptoms; it especially has the ability to clear up the lungs that were not properly cleared up at the time of
his illness.
Sulphur cures bronchitis. It cures asthmatic bronchitis when the symptoms agree. Sulphur has a most violent cough that racks the whole frame; it seems that the head will fly off; pain in the head when coughing; the head is jarred by the cough. Then he has expectoration of blood, bleeding from the lungs; in all of these cases threatening phthisis, when there is yet not too much deposit of tubercle, when there is only the beginning of tubercular deposit.
The low, stricken down constitution, the emaciated subjects that have inherited phthisis who have the all- gone hungry feeling in the stomach, heat on the top of the head and uneasiness from the warmth of the bed.
These cases would be better if they had plenty of eruptions come out upon the body; but as a matter of fact the skin has no eruptions; there is no relief; it is all going on in his internals and he is gradually breaking down.
Sulphur will in such instances rouse that patient out of his phthisical state and he will return to health, or, if be is too bad for that be may be kept for years from his troubles. Look out for it in the advanced state of phthisis. You have had sufficient said concerning its administration in such a condition. It increases the suppuration, and brings on little pneumonias wherever there is a tubercle; it tends to suppurate these out. Every cell that is incapable of carrying on its function will be sloughed out by Sulphur.
Back and limbs: The striking thing in Sulphur as to the back is pain in the back on rising from a seat, compelling him to walk bent, and he can only straighten up slowly after moving. The pain is principally in the lumbo-sacral region.
The extremities are covered with eruptions. Eruptions upon the back of the bands and between the fingers, and sometimes upon the palms; vesicular and scaly eruptions which itch; pustules, boils and little abscesses irregular erysipelatous patches here and there upon the extremities a dirty appearance of the skin.
Skin: Itching of the skin from the warmth of the bed.
Enlargement of the joints. Rheumatic affections; great stiffness of the joints; tightness in the hollow of the knees; tightness of the tendons, of rheumatic and gouty character. Cramps in the legs and soles of the feet. Burning of the soles of the feet in bed; he puts them out of bed to cool them of the soles cramp and burn and itch.
At times you will find the soles are cold, and then again burning, and these states alternate with each other. Distress of the body with coldness of the limbs, but after going to bed they burn so much that he must put them out. The corns, which he is a victim of and suffers from almost constantly, burn and sting in the warmth of the bed.
The skin of a Sulphur patient ulcerates and suppurates easily; a splinter under the skin will cause it to ulcerate; wounds heal slowly and fester. Every little prick of a pin festers as in Hepar.
The eruptions of Sulphur are too numerous to mention. They are of all sorts, but there are a few characterizing features in all, such as the burning, stinging and itching and the aggravation from the warmth of the bed.
The skin is rough and unhealthy. Upon the face are many "black-heads," acne, pimples and pustules. Sulphur is full of boils and abscesses in all parts of the body, squamous eruptions, vesicular eruptions, etc.
They are all present in Sulphur and they burn and sting.
Sulphuricum Acidum
The sensation of quivering all over the body and in the limbs without visible trembling is a very strong symptom of Sulphuric acid, and especially if it is associated with weakness that has been of long standing.

The discharges are excoriating. General sweat after eating. The symptoms predominate on the right side. It is often indicated in sour-smelling babies like Hepar, and it is as sensitive to touch and nearly as sensitive to cold. When it has cured the sensitiveness to cold the patient often becomes worse ‘and requires Pulsatilla, which is the complement and antidote.
Mind: Prostration of mind and body, with extreme sadness, weeps continuously.

Syphilinum
Whenever the symptoms that are representative of the patient himself have been suppressed in any case of syphilis, and nothing remains but weakness and a few results of the storm that has long ago or recently passed, this nosode will cause reaction and restore order and sometimes do much curing, and the symptoms that must always be present, that represent the disordered state of the economy will appear to guide to a restoration of health.
When a syphilitic patient has suffered from a course of typhoid he may be very slow in convalescing, but a single dose of Syphilinum high will cause him to eat and feel stronger and gain rapidly.
How does the old school treatment of syphilis differ from barbarism? one might well ask. The strong drugging by Mercurius and iodides so debilitate that all who pass through are invalids and weak; even then they are not cured of syphilis - if they were cured we could not cause to come back the symptoms that have been removed.
Syphilinum often does bring back the ulcers in the throat and the eruptions. When there are violent neuralgias of the head, in sides of head and over the eyes, great soreness in bones of legs and head, and the multitude of symptoms of nerve syphilis all nondescript, then it is that the patient will be made free from suffering, and given sleep, strength and appetite.
But the ulcers and eruptions will come back in some cases, and it is all the better if they do. It is by no means limited to patients who have had syphilis. It can be used like any remedy against the symptoms of the provings, or such as are similar to symptoms common to the disease or against the symptoms like the numerous verified clinical symptoms.
Many symptoms are worse at night in bed, many come on in the evening and last till morning. From sundown to sunrise marks the time of many violent pains and sufferings. Some are better from heat, and
some are better from cold air and cold applications, There is great prostration in the morning on waking. It has cured many cases of epilepsy. Epileptic convulsions after -menses. Sleeplessness, sometimes only one- half of the night, again the whole night. The blood feels hot flowing through the arteries during the night.
Wandering pains here and there all over the body. Pain in the periosteum, nerves and joints. Pains sometimes increase gradually and decrease gradually. Sharp pains here and there. Complaints worse in the cold weather of winter and heat of summer. Extreme emaciation. Abscesses. Paralysis of limbs. Caries of bone. Curvature of spine. Gummata. Dwarfish children. Curvature of bones. Enlarged glands. Offensive odor of the body. Soreness to touch in many parts, especially bones. It has often been observed that in syphilized invalids remedies act but a few days and must be changed.
This always calls for the nosode, when there is only great weakness and few symptoms it will act well.
When there is ulceration of legs, throat, mouth or other parts with no repair. Fistulous openings, exostoses, fissures, tubercles and warts have been cured promptly. When it has been used against the primary manifestations of the disease and in the earlier phenomena it has generally resulted in failure. It is seldom the best remedy for syphilis per se, but for marked and suppressed syphilis it seems to restore a sort of order and bring better reaction.
The author has many times observed that gummata in throat and anus will take on destructive ulceration in old broken down cases after Sulphur has been given, and that Syphilinum will restrain it and establish repair.
Sulphur often produces prolonged aggravation when there are many tissue changes in advanced cases of syphilis. Such changes are most likely gummata. The effort of Sulphur is to remove the results of disease, which the patient cannot stand. It often causes suspicion of latent syphilis when such aggravations are very severe after Sulphur high. Sulphur low will not be followed by such results. After such prolonged aggravations Syphilinum should be considered. Latent syphilis often exists where it is least expected. This nosode should be used only in high potencies.

After receiving a few doses of Syphilinum he took on new energy and became industrious and prosperous. Much vertigo. Aphasia. In some of these cases of brain syphilis. Sulphur and Causticum have caused prolonged suffering and weakness. Syphilinum will act favorably.

Thuja Occidentalis
The general appearance of the Thuya subject, if he has a characteristic picture, is that of a waxy, shiny face, it looks as if he had been smeared over with grease; and is often transparent, he is a sickly looking individual, looks as if entering upon some cachexia.
This is often the case in the sycotic, constitution and the cancerous cachexia, weakly, cachectic, yellowish, or often very pallid.
Skin: The skin manifests many symptoms. The perspiration is peculiar, it is sweetish honey, sometimes like garlic, strong and pungent.
A pungent odor emanates from the genitals, sweetish honey-like like odor to the sweat from the genitalia, he smells his genitals.
The odor is also like burnt horn, burnt feathers or burnt sponge. These peculiar strong odors are particularly present when there are fig warts upon the genitals such as Thuja cures.
The skin looks unhealthy everywhere about the body and there is a copious sweat on first going to sleep, like Arsenic. If you had only the waxiness such as Arsenic and Thuja produce, you might prescribe Arsenic. Arsenic is often the acute and Thuja the chronic. You remember that Arsenic is usually a chronic remedy.
Asthma: A peculiar asthmatic condition is found in sycosis and Arsenic appears to be indicated for the symptoms, but it only relieves, it does not control the predisposition, it acts like Aconite in acute diseases and only ameliorates for a moment. Asthmatic and many other sycotic conditions seem to call for Arsenic,
but it will do nothing but palliate, the constitutionality is not reached by Arsenic, its fundamental symptoms are not similar.
In syphilis and psora Arsenic acts a long time and eradicates the complaints, when similar to them, but it is not similar to sycosis. Arsenic does not go to the bottom of the trouble, but Thuja and Natrum sulph. will take up the work and cure. Natrum sulph. and Thuja bring back the primitive manifestation that has been suppressed for years.
Warts: The tendency of the Thuja patient is to throw out wart-like excrescences which are soft and pulpy and very sensitive, they burn, itch and bleed easily when rubbed the clothing. Horny excrescences that form on the hands and split open form upon a pedicle and crack around the base.
Cauliflower excrescences upon the cervix uteri, about the anus (like Nitricum acidum), about the labia majora and mucous membranes generally.
Horny excrescences, more upon the skin. Warts of a brownish color, especially if upon the abdomen the body; great brown spots, like liver spots, form upon the abdomen.
Zona around the chest, herpetic eruptions everywhere, here and there, like Sepia, herpes labialis and preputialis. Zona is a herpetic formation, great vesicular patches come out upon the body called "shingles", here we should compare Thuja, Rhus, Graph, Kali hydr., and Mezereum.
This condition is attended with a great amount of suffering and neuralgic pains. In cases that are sycotic, Thuya is especially a grand remedy.
You will have a class of cases where the warts have been caused to disappear by calomel, which makes them shrivel up and off, such is the old school treatment. Sometimes a patient comes to you with erratic symptoms and you may study for hours over these symptoms, and see very little order in them, you will realize that the leading features have been left out and that something is lacking.
Some one has applied Nitric acid, calomel or something else, and driven these fig warts away. These condylomata could not come without having some constitutional basis, these warts have a cause, and that cause seems to be less able to make the patient sick if he has the warts, he feels better when he has the warts. Strange to say; when these warts have been suppressed, we get symptoms of Nitric acid, Thuja, Mercurius and Staphysagria.
Thuja leads all medicines for symptoms coming from suppressed fig-warts.
Thuja is pre-eminently a strong medicine when you have a trace of animal poisoning in the history, as snake bite, small-pox and vaccination.
There are probably several varieties of urethral discharges, there is one that is sycotic, and when that has been suppressed, it produced a miasm with soreness in the bottom the feet and in the knees and particularly through the back and loins and sciatic nerves, in the knees and ankle joints.
Sometimes it affects the upper extremities, but particularly the lower. Most violent aggravation when keeping still, like Rhus, great aching that increases so long as he keeps still, he is very often compelled to keep the bed, and then he constantly moves and turns. An antisycotic must be selected.
While this group of symptoms would be cured by Rhus when the case is not sycotic, when these symptoms come from suppressed gonorrhoea Medorrhinum or Thuja will cure.
Thuja enters into this particular sphere and takes hold of this particular case where sycosis is at the bottom. Sometimes when the discharge has been suppressed, orchitis comes on and then Pulsatilla will be the remedy, and very seldom Thuja.
Thuja affects the left testicle with intense squeezing pain, but most generally you will find Pulsatilla the remedy.
As we continue to study Thuja, we see that it has a profound action upon the glands, stitching, tearing pains in the glands, the pains are as if the gland were being torn to pieces. That may be true of glands in general, but one particular gland, the ovary, is more affected than any other and especially the left.
Women: This is so true, that if you meet a violent pain in the left ovary, coming on at the time of menstruation and continuing during the flow and extending down the thighs, but may be in every direction, it increases as the flow comes on, stinging, tearing, burning, bursting pains, as if the parts were being torn out, make her cry aloud, she goes into a hysterical state. This a very strong Thuja group. It has the opposite of Zinc., and Lachesis, for in these, relief comes with the flow.
Many women suffer from grumbling pains in the ovaries all the time, they have a sense of the organ, which they should not feel; pain from taking cold or in change of weather; the increase of the pain in the left ovary is the first sign; sometimes the pain is so severe that the right one suffers apparently, from sympathy. Where the ovaries have been affected for some time there will be mental symptoms, a most violent irritability, jealous, quarrelsomeness, ugliness.
This irritability is likely to been shown towards individuals about the house, toward the husband and the mother; she is yet able to control herself among strangers and the doctor may not be able to find out about it, because she has in her nature a disposition to cheat; she wants to be alone and takes upon herself fixed ideas; that she is pregnant, or that an animal is in her bowels, she is followed, or that someone is walking beside her, thinks that soul and body are separated.
Now, these are fixed ideas, and there is no use trying to reason them out of her. It seems to her that she is very delicate, that she is made of glass and that she will break. The idea is that she will break, and not that she is transparent.
Associated with this conditions, we have violent, intense, tearing headaches, tearing in the eye, ameliorated by heat. The eye-ball pains are better from heat and the rest are better in the cool open air.
Pain localized in small spots. A nail driven in the head, side of head and forehead, like Ignatia and Anacardium. These pains are intensified into tearing pains, and affect the eye-ball, making it so sore that it can hardly be touched; worse from heat and worse from lying down; worse in a warm room and better in the open air.
Rheumatic head symptoms are worse in damp air. They are worse from sour things and also from stimulating and exciting things.
Crude drugs do not impress the vital force, so lastingly, but an individual who is thoroughly sensitive and properly sensitive, as sensitive of contagion, then if you undertake to prove by giving it night and morning, you will rivet upon him a life-long miasm.
If you have given a medicine, wait for the symptoms to come and go in the natural manner. To a great extent t, this is the tendency with sycosis, the tendency is rather outward.
We see in the proving of a drug what we see in disease. When a gonorrhoea is contracted, it goes through the prodromal period and then comes the disease, which, if let alone, has in its nature a tendency to eradicate itself from the economy, and then the patients do not suffer from lasting conditions.
In the old school, they always suppress the discharge, and there are those in the new school who do little better.
The frequent repetition by which one is exposed, would not increase the gonorrhea itself, because the susceptibility is satisfied.
The taking of more of the drug to prove it does not do so much harm, provided the one who is directing the proving realizes when the symptoms begin to rise, and then stops the drug.
Now if we go on with the proving by repeating the doses after the symptoms come on, we force the drug into the economy when he is already poisoned, and by this means we get a confusion in the symptoms, the drug disease engrafted upon that individual for life.
Many of the provings of Thuja give us that kind of confusion, so that we see only now and then symptoms cropping out that are striking; in fact, the great bulk of the Thuja provings has been wasted, because there is so much confusion in the great number of symptoms, while the earlier provings brought out many of the characteristics, the Vienna provings, to a great extent, confused the image of Thuja.
So that, by clinical experience only, we have been able to draw out the finer features of Thuja. It requires more than a school boy to do that. The new provings must be carried on in a different manner.
Catarrhal conditions: Thuja has some striking bowel symptoms; gushing, watery morning diarrhoea, like water coming out of a bunghole.
There is also a general catarrhal condition running through the body; catarrh of the nose, ears and chest. In the catarrh of the chest it produces an intense hacking cough, with expectoration in the morning of greenish mucus, sometimes a copious expectoration. It is often suited to old cases of pneumonia, in such individuals as have suppressed gonorrhoea, fig-wart gonorrhoea.
The kidneys and urinary symptoms are also striking; congestion and inflammation of the kidneys, sharp pain in the kidneys; burning urine; inflammation of the bladder and urethra that is not gonorrhoeal; pus from the bladder; paralysis of the bladder, must wait a long time for the urine to start; retention of urine, continuous urging to urinate, tearing in the urethra, feeling as if the urine were constantly running along the urethra, like Kali bich. and Petros.
In the urethral disease of sycotic character, Thuja leads all other remedies. In the non-sycotic variety, Cannabis sativa is sufficient, but those cases that have proved to the sycotic Cann. sat. left uncured, it ameliorated the burning during and after urination and the thick yellowish green discharge, but some other remedy had always to follow, when they were shown to be sycotic. It is not so with Thuja, because it is capable of finishing the case.
In the most violent cases, with bloody urine, extreme salacity, great torment, bloody, watery discharge from the urethra and bladder, no rest day or night, Cantharis comes in, it is capable of finishing the case in a few
days. Such a patient must be in excellent health, which is not generally the case. They are drinking men and smokers.
Tobacco is one of the most troublesome things you will run across, many cases will not recover promptly if they are tobacco users and great smokers, wine drinkers or convivial men, they run around a good deal mc and are high livers and with such you have a slow case on hand.
With the system so broken down front high living, you may not get a decided curative action until you have forced him to abandon his way of living. Put him on light diet, diminish his smoking, get rid entirely of the drinking, and put him ona perfectly bland living.
This is the first thing. If he is a man of family we have to contend with great mental distress, and not less so if a woman. So it may well be said, that usually the sycotic miasm is a troublesome one to begin with and one that will bother the young physician.
You cannot substitute the right method for a wrong one, which will make him a cripple for life.
The suppression of the disease, as usually tried, cannot be thought of by the sincere and earnest homeopath.
If he wants it checked suddenly, let him go somewhere else, but warn him what will take place, and he will have untold disease and suffering.
Tuberculinum Bovinum
I want to take up the study of Tuberculinum.
The preparation which I use is a little different from that which is generally found in the market. This preparation | procured through a Professor of Veterinary Surgery.
In Pennsylvania there came a time when a handsome herd of cattle had to be slaughtered because of tuberculosis. Through the Veterinary Surgeon of the Pennsylvania University I secured some: of the tubercular glands from these slaughtered cattle.
Dynamization: | selected from these the most likely specimen.
This was potentized by Boericke & Tafel as far as the 6th, and has since been prepared on the Skinner machine, the 30 th, 200 th, 1000 th and the higher potencies. This preparation I have been using for fifteen years. Many of my friends have been using if, as they have procured it from me.
From observing the effects of this preparation I have been gathering these notes in my inter-leaved Hering's Guiding'Symptoms, and, they now guide me in the use of Tuberculinum. I do not use Tuberc. merely because it is a nosode, or with the idea that generally prevails of using nosodes; that is, a product of the disease for the disease, and the results of the disease. This I fear is too much the prevailing thought in using nosodes.
In certain places it prevails and is taught that anything relating to syphilis must be treated with Syphilinum; that anything relating to gonorrhoea must be treated with Medorrhinum, anything psoric. must be treated with Psorinum, and anything that relates to tuberculosis must be treated with Tuberculinum.
That will go out of use some day; it is mere isopathy, and it is an unsound doctrine. It is not the better idea of Homoeopathy. It is not based upon sound principles. It belongs to a hysterical Homoeopathy that prevails in this century. Yet much good has come out of it.
It is hoped that provings may be made so that we may be able to prescribe Tuberc. on the symptoms of Tuberc. just as we would use any drug.
It is deep acting, constitutionally deep, because it is a product of disease from a very deep-seated constitutional condition, like Silica and Sulphur. it goes deep into the life; it is antipsoric; it is long acting, and it affects constitutions more deeply than most remedies; and when our deepest remedies act only a few weeks, and they have to be changed, this remedy comes in as one of the remedies-when the symptoms agree and brings a better state of reaction, so that remedies hold longer. It may well be considered a species of Psorinum.
One of the most prominent uses of this remedy is in intermittent fever. Some of our most stubborn cases of intermittent fever will relapse and continue relapsing, even when such remedies as Silica and Calcarea and the deeper-acting remedies have been indicated, have acted we have broken the fever, and in a few weeks, from exposure to cold, from sitting in a draft, from becoming fatigued, from mental exertion, from over- eating and from disordering the stomach this ague has returned.
Any of these circumstances will bring back these stubborn cases of intermittent fever when Tuberc. is needed. When a patient is traveling toward phthisis and he is exposed and intermittent comes out. He is of a feeble constitution and his complaints have a tendency to relapse, and remedies well selected do not hold long, though they act well at first, they must soon be changed-changing symptoms.
It is not an indication for Tuberc. when the well selected remedy fails to act. Well selected is a relative expression and involves too much of human opinion. It may be thought to be well selected when it is not related to the case. When, the well selected remedy has acted and the constitution shows a tendency to break down, and the well selected remedy does not hold, because of vital weakness and because of deep- seated tendencies; then it is that this remedy sometimes fits in.
Such a case is often tuberculous in inclination, even though no evidence is present, of a pathological character.
Burnett, dropped an idea, that has been confirmed many times. Patients who have inherited phthisis, patients whose parents have died of phthisis are often of feeble vitality. They do not throw off their inherited tendencies.
They are always tired. They take on sicknesses easily. They become anaemic; nervous; waxy or pale. These conditions are sometimes met, when the finer symptoms agree, although Burnett evidently used this medicine in a sort of routine way for this kind of constitution, which he called "Consumptiveness.” Persons who had inherited phthisis, who were debilitated and anaemic.
It seems from looking over the record of many cures that this remedy has been given many times for just that state on a paucity of symptoms, and if the records can be believed, it has many times balanced up to the constitution in that anaemic state, where the inheritance has been phthisis. It is not the best indication
for Tuberc., but where the symptoms agree in addition to that inheritance, then you may have indications for the remedy.
Tuberculinum Bovinum be given in 10 M., 50 M.. and 100 M. potencies, two doses of each potency at long intervals, all children and young people who have inherited tuberculosis may be immuned from their inheritance and their resiliency will be restored. It cures most cases of adenoids and tuberculous glands of the neck.
Mind: The nodes that have guided me to in use I will attempt to explain.
The mental symptoms that I have seen give way while the patient was under treatment, and the mental symptoms that I have seen crop out under the provings, and the mental symptoms that I have so often seen associated when the patient is poisoned by the tubercular toxines are as belong to many complaints and are cured by Tuberc.
Hopelessness in many complaints. Aversion to mental work. Anxiety evening, until midnight. Anxiety during fever. Loquacity during fever. Weary of life. Cosmopolitan. Tormenting, persistent thoughts during the night.
Thoughts intrude and crowd upon each other during the night. These I will say are the common mental features, and have often yielded when the remedy has been prescribed. Anyone who has inherited phthisis, anyone who has been in a state of debility, who has had intermittent fever with continual replases, and these mental symptoms are present, you may think of Tuberc. Loquacity during fever is a common feature in hectic fever when the patient, is decidedly affected by the toxines of tuberculosis.
A person gradually running down, never finding the right remedy, or relief only momentarily; has a constant desire to change, and travel, and go somewhere, and do something different, or to find a new doctor.
The desire to travel, that cosmopolitan condition of the mind belongs strongly to the one who needs Tuberc. It comes out so often in clinical experience; is found so often in the Calcareas and especially in Calc. Phos., always wanting to go somewhere. Such is the condition of those about to go into insanity, about to go into some lingering disease. Persons on the border land of insanity.
It is true that phthisis and insanity are convertible conditions, the one falls into the other. Many cases that are treated and cured, and phthisis of the lungs has just been turned aside, finally become insane. Persons who have been cured of insanity go into phthisis and die, showing the deep-seated character of their nature. The intellectual symptoms and the lung symptoms are interchangeable.
Head: Tuberculinum cures the most violent and the most chronic periodical sick headaches, periodical nervous headaches.
Coming every week; every two weeks; and the irregular periodicity coming under certain conditions, in damp weather, after overwork, from mental excitement, from overeating, disordered stomach. Tuberc. breaks up the tendency to this chronic periodical headache when the symptoms agree.
It has been observed in the hands of good prescribers that, when chronic constitutional headaches have been broken up sometimes the patient has a tendency to lose flesh and become feeble. An entire transformation scene takes place; a cough sets in; the headache has been removed, but the patient is feeble. Whenever that takes place Tuberc is a most useful remedy. A new manifestation comes; a new organ is affected.
Sore bruised feeling all over the body. Aching of the bones. Sore bruised condition of the eyeballs, sensitive to touch, and on turning the eye sideways. Persons who have long felt the weakness of tuberculosis, tubercular conditions, and are subject to cold sweat on the head. This was brought out in the provings of Calcarea, and those about to go into phthisis have many times been cured by Calcarea.
The relation ship between Tuberc. And Calc. is very close. They are interchangeable; that is, the one may be indicated for a while, and then the other. They are both deep-acting remedies - also Silica is closely related to Tuberc., on the same plane of action, going deep into the life in a similar way; Calcarea, Tuberc. and Silica, and the Silicates.
In the Guiding Symptoms is a record,
"Pain in the head, as if the head had a tight hoop of iron around it,” an iron band.
Headache, with frequent sharp cutting pains. Headache, worse from motion. In the Guiding Symptoms, "A sullen, taciturn, irritable" condition of mind.
"Screams in his sleep.
Is very restless at night.
Sister died of tubercular meningitis."
That symptom was given by Burnett. It has cured hydrocephalus.
Many years ago Doctor Biegler cured a case of tubercular meningitis with Tuberc. In many instances it has cured tubercular meningitis and tubercular diseases of the brain in the early stages. The face becomes red,
even to purple, during the chill, and during the heat. Aversion to all foods. Such aversion to meat that it becomes impossible to eat it.
Thirst during the chill and heat, for large quantities of cold water. It has cured tubercular meningitis with effusion, where the head was greatly enlarged. Craving for cold milk. Emptiness in the abdomen, with faint feeling. Anxiety in the abdomen and stomach, much like the Sulphur sensation described. An all gone, hungry feeling, that drives him to eat. This has been cured by Tuberc. after Sulphur had failed.
All know what a marked feature emaciation is in persons who are going into phthisis. The emaciation often begins before there is any sign of phthisis, gradually losing flesh. A gradually growing weakness, a gradually increasing fatigue.
This is a prominent place for Tuberc., if the symptoms agree. Always let that stand out boldly, IF THE SYMPTOMS AGREE, and WHEN THE SYMPTOMS AGREE. Of course it will be said that Tuberc. has cured when there are few symptoms this is granted, but should not be lauded as a clinical practice.
Bowels and rectum: It is a common feature of tubercular affections of the brain and of the meninges to suffer from constipation.
Stool large and hard; or, constipation alternating with diarrhoea. It is a well-known clinical fact. Constipation is a strong feature of Tuberc.
"Constipation, stool large and hard; then diarrhoea. Itching of the anus.
Sudden diarrhoea before breakfast, with nausea. Inguinal glands indurated and visible.
Excessive sweat in chronic diarrhea."
That symptom was brought out by Burnett. It was merely a clinical symptom. Burnett dwells on this phase of it;
"Tabes Mesenterica."
"Swelling on left side, also on right; complains of a stitch in side after running; languid and indisposed to talk.
Nervous and irritable.
Talks in his sleep; grinds his teeth. Appetite poor.
Hands blue.
Indurated and palpable glands everywhere. A drum belly.
Spleen region bulging out."
That was one of Burnett's clinical cases. That was cured by Burnett's Bacillinum. In most instances, I am informed, he used the Bacillinum 200 th.
It is acommon feature of Sulphur to be driven out of bed in the morning by a diarrhoea. It is a very common feature in cases of phthisis, and patients going into phthisis. In advanced stage of phthisis, driven out of bed with a diarrhoea; or, diarrhoea worse in the morning than at any other time in the twenty-four
hours. This is a common feature of phthisis that Tuberc. has cured, and it has been verified many times, although it is a clinical symptom.
General relaxation. Weakness and hanging down of the genitals. Relaxed scrotum. Menses too early, too profuse, long lasting. Amenorrhoea. Dysmenorrheea. Cough before, and during chill.
Suffocation; worn in a warm room. Tubercular deposits in apices of lungs (left).
The uterus sags down and is heavy at the menstrual period, a relaxation, as if the inner parts would come out.
Dry hacking cough before the evening chill (Rhus t.). and the hacking cough lasts sometimes during the chill, and sometimes during the fever, but be knows the chill is coming by the cough. The patient has been cured perhaps a number of times by remedies. Intermittent fever has been cured a number of times by remedies well selected.
The fever goes away promptly under the action of the remedy; but from slight exposure, as was mentioned, it comes back again. Now at the end of three, four or five weeks - often two or three - he says,
"I know my old chills are coming back again, because of the cough I have."
The previous remedies have not been successful. They are not deep enough acting, they are not long enough acting.
When the homoeopathic remedy is really and truly able to cure the diseased condition it will hold that case, so that when the symptoms come back again the same remedy will be indicated, and only a changed potency, perhaps will be necessary.
The same remedy is called for; but it is an indication for Tuberc, when at every coming back of the case it calls for a new remedy. Calcarea breaks up the case once, and the next time it comes back it calls for something else, and the next time for something else, and it keeps turning around.
Perhaps a number of times it calls for the same remedies again. Changing about. That very changing and unsatisfied symptom image is a strong indication for this medicine.
Respiration: Suffocation in a warm room.
Can find easy breathing only when riding in the cold wind. When phthisical patients find no comfort except riding in the cold wind - which is a rare symptom, but has been noticed. This was a symptom specially marked in the lamented Gregg, of Buffalo. He would ride out in the cold winds by the lake for hours. Arg. nit. many times relieved that, but it is a strong symptom of Tuberc. He finally died of tuberculosis.
Desire for deep breathing. Longs for the open air. Wants the doors and windows open. Sits in the room covered with a cold sweat, but wants the air, wants fresh air. When covered with cold sweat he cannot have the wind blowing on him because he takes cold, he is sensitive to it, but he wants the fresh air, he wants the open air. Especially when the tubercular deposits begin in the apex of the left lung, which is the indication that has been verified by quite a number of observers.
"Hard, dry cough. Hard, dry, shaking cough,” were symptoms noticed by Boardman - regardless of phthisis. The expectoration is thick, yellow, often yellowish-green in catarrhal conditions. Hacking cough in young girls, where there is a suppression of the menstrual flow of the first menses.
They come on once or twice or three times, and the patient is yellow, is puny, is tired, has a hacking cough, and a suspicious chest. If the tubercular deposits have not gone too far, Tuberc. may arrest the progress of the disease. Tuberc. often gives immunity if taken before the tuberculosis begins in those who have inherited it. It immunes the constitution.
Another marked feature recorded by Burnett was ringworms. Burnett was of the opinion that ringworms commonly formed upon those who had inherited phthisis. He thought it was a sign of approaching phthisis, that it was a very common feature of those who have inherited phthisis; and he used the Bacillinum 200 th. He used it somewhat as a routine remedy on every child with ringworm.
Patients who suffer from weakness in the evening. Rapid pulse in the evening. Every evening for years he has noticed the pulse has been rapid. Palpitation after the evening meal.
Jerking of the muscles or going to sleep, and during sleep. Rheumatic pain in the right elbow. Sore bruised condition of the bones and periosteum. Aching, drawing pains in the limbs during rest, better by walking. A strong feature of this remedy is that its pains and aches are better by motion. I have seen this aching distress in the limbs many times where Rhus has acted only temporarily or has failed; where Rhus seemed to be the remedy, but was not deep enough to hold its action.
Where Rhus was superficially indicated - or the deep action of the disturbance, the deep inheritance - the tired constitution, the chronic nature of the case prevents the action of Rhus, and Tuberc. cures these cases.
Especially in girls that are bookkeepers, and shopkeepers, who have inherited phthisical constitutions, who have aches and pains during damp weather, in rainy weather, during a storm, when the weather changes, when the weather becomes cold; then it is that Tuberc. cures after such remedies as Rhus have failed; these patients are better by motion, better by walking; worse during rest.
While sitting the pains become so severe that be is driven to travel, driven to walk. Aching, drawing pains in limbs during rest, better walking. Coldness of left foot and leg, evening in bed. Stitching pains in limbs during rest. Wandering pains in limbs - in joints. Pains all over the body, but mostly lower limbs.
Aching, drawing, tearing, as if in bones, and nerves, during rest; better walking. Pains in bones lower limbs. Stiffness on beginning to move. Sore bruised joints. Pains all ameliorated by heat. Drawing pains in thighs. Stitching pains in limbs. Restless. Stiffness of lower limbs, evening. Physical exertion aggravates. Complaints worse standing; must move. This is as marked in this remedy as in Sulphur.
Intermittent fever, with drawing in limbs during rest. Chill 7 P.M.
Chilliness, evening; better in bed. Chill 5 P.M., with thirst. Cough before chill, during chill, and vomiting during fever. Wants to be covered during all stages. Extreme heat, with chilliness. Relapsing intermittents
Drawing in the limbs in the evening before the chill, and during the chill. He knows the chill is coming on because of the drawing in the limbs. Chill at 11 o'clock at night. Must be covered up during all stages, the chill, the fever and the sweat. The chilliness extends into the fever and into the sweat if there is any uncovering.
Aching in the bones of the head, with soreness of the periosteum and these are better by traveling about, like Rhus. Better by motion worse keeping still.
Skin: Perspiration from mental exertion.
Perspiration stains the linen yellow. Heat and perspiration during sleep. We know what a common feature it is in phthisis to have night sweats. Formication in the skin.
This remedy has cured tubercular eruptions of the skin. This remedy has cured red purplish eruptions that are nodular in character; the patient wants to sit all the time by the fire - itching in cold air, better by going to the fire, worse from scratching. Sensitive to every change of the weather, especially to cold, and to damp weather, and sometimes to warm damp weather, and to rainy weather. Always worse before a storm.
Can feel every electric change in the weather. Becoming cold brings on all the symptoms pains, aches, distresses and sufferings. A large list of symptoms of patients that have been cured in all their varying conditions may be found by looking up the Guiding Symptoms.
Periodicity, then, is a strong feature of this remedy, and sensitive to weather changes. Fainting fits, Weakness after a short walk.
It has cured constitutional headaches, periodical headaches, that existed forty-five years. It cures even old people of these periodical complaints.
The pains will sometimes travel. Stitching; pinching, cramping, wandering; and always worse from cold, and from cold damp weather.
Valeriana
This remedy cures many nervous and hysterical phenomena in excitable women and children, and the complaints of the hypochondriac.
Great nervous excitability, exaltation, hysterical contractures, trembling, palpitation, sense of levitation, paroxysmal respiration, stitching pains, tension in the limbs, jerking, twitching, globus hystericus.
Sensation of something warm rising from the stomach, causing paroxysmal suffocation. All the nerves are in a fret. Oversensitiveness of all the senses; great nervous restlessness.
All these general symptoms come on during rest, and are relieved by motion and moving about. Fainting easily. Slight exertion brings on symptoms. Complaints change about, and pains wander from place to place.
It is a great remedy for the numerous nondescript nervous manifestations that come in spinal irritation when there is amelioration by motion and aggravation by much exertion. Exertion brings on headache in these cases. Stitching pains all over the body during rest.
The mental state is often ecstatic or hysterical. The mind undergoes rapid changes in disposition and ideas. The mental symptoms come on at night; sees images, animals and men. The mental state is one of extreme activity, tension, excitement, passes from one subject to another.

Veratrum Album
You will be astonished at the wonderful coldness running through this remedy.
Coldness: Hardly a group of symptoms will arise without this accompanying coldness. Coldness of discharges, coldness of the body. You would also wonder at the remarkable prostration attending the
various groups of symptoms, complete relaxation and exhaustion, coldness. Profuse sweat, vomiting and diarrhea.
Profuse watery discharges. These conditions occur without apparent provocation. In cholera or cholera morbus, it seems that the fluids run out of the body.
Lies in bed, relaxed prostrated, cold to the finger-tips, with corresponding blueness, fairly purple; lips cold and blue, countenance pinched and shrunken; great sensation of cold ness as if the blood were ice-water; scalp cold; forehead covered with cold sweat; headache and exhaustion; coldness in spots over the body; extremities cold as death. Full of cramps; looks as if he would die.
This state comes out during the menses, during colic with nausea, with mania and violent delirium, with headache, with violent inflammations. Is it any wonder that Hahnemann predicted that Veratrum, Camphor, and Cuprum would become remedies in the cure of cholera; he saw in their nature the ability to cure.
He saw the similitude. In cases of this sort which are characterized by superabundance of cramps, Cuprum is the simillimum. For those with coldness and blueness and scanty sweat, vomiting, and purging, Camphor is the remedy. These are called "dry cholera;" they sink down and die without exhaustive discharges. In proportion as there are coldness, blueness and scanty discharges, Camphor is indicated. In proportion as copiousness, blueness, and coldness are present, Veratrum is indicated. Secale has something of cholera in it. Podo. has exhaustive stools. Ars. anxious restlessness.
Mind: The mental symptoms are marked by violence and destructiveness he wants to destroy, to tear something; he tears the clothes from the body.
Always wants to be busy, to carry on his daily work. A cooper who was suffering from the Veratrum insanity would pile up chairs on top of one another. When asked what he was doing, he replied that he was piling up staves. When not occupied with this he was tearing his clothes, or praying for hours on his knees, and so loud that he could be heard blocks away.
Exalted state of religious frenzy, believes he is the risen Christ screams and screeches until he is blue in the face; head cold as ice, cold sweat, reaches out and exhorts to repentance. Exhorts to repent, preaches, howls, sings obscene songs, exposes the person. Fear and the effects of fear; fear of death and of being damned; imagines the world is on fire.
"Mania with desire to cut and tear everything, especially the clothes, with lewdness and lascivious talk.
Puerperal mania and convulsions, with violent cerebral congestion; bluish and bloated face; protruding eyes; wild shrieks, with disposition to bite and tear.
Loquacity, he talks rapidly.
She is inconsolable over a fancied misfortune; runs around the room howling and screaming or sits brooding, wailing and weeping."
Alternate states of brooding, screaming, and screeching. A few such remedies would empty our insane asylums, especially of recent cases.
Insanity is curable if there are no incurable results of disease. Full of despair and hopelessness with approaching insanity.
"Despair of his recovery, attempts suicide."
Insane people are not hopeless, those approaching insanity are but after they become insane, they think that everybody is crazy except themselves. Those bowed down by great grief and despair are likely to go into a state of violent mania. Veratrum carries them through the state of despair.
"Melancholia, head hangs down, sits brooding in silence."
Young girls go on for years with menstrual difficulties, and preceding each menstrual nisus is a state of despair; never smiles, the world seems blue, everything is dark; these are preparing for a marked state of insanity.
Veratrum is a remedy that would keep many women out of the insane asylum, especially those with uterine troubles. Girls at puberty suffer with dysmenorrhoea, hysterical mental states, diarrhea, and vomiting. During the menses they become cold as death, lips blue, extremities cold and blue, dreadful pains, sensation of sinking, mania to kiss everybody, hysteria with coldness at the menstrual period, copious sweat, vomiting, and diarrhoea, etc.
Head: Veratrum has troublesome headaches, neuralgic, of great violence, accompanied with coldness, vomiting of bile and blood, great exhaustion, profuse sweat.
Vomiting and retching after the stomach is empty; spasmodic retching and cramping of the stomach; you can see the effort to empty the stomach and every little while a mouthful of bile comes up.
Violent rush of blood to the head, congestion of the head with coldness of the extremities. Head feels as if packed with ice, feels as if ice lay on the vertex and occiput (Calc.). Tension in the head as if the membranes
were drawn tighter about the brain; compressive pains.
I remember a farmer who consulted me in the Summer. He had strange sensation when he drank water, as if it ran down the outside and did not go down the oesophagus. It was so marked that he I requested his friends to see if it did not run down the outside. Veratrum 2 M. cured him. No remedy has produced that sensation, but I figured it out by analogy.
Violent thirst for cold water and for ice. "All fruits cause painful distension of the stomach." "Vomiting forcible and excessive.
Nausea with weakness; is obliged to lie down; hysterical cramps in the stomach; cramps in the muscles of the abdomen like colic.
Gastric catarrh, great weakness, cold, sudden sinking."
Pains: Full of rheumatic and neuralgic pains in the extremities; worse from the warmth of the bed; they drive him out of bed at night into the cold room and be must walk the floor for relief.
You would naturally, suppose that heat would be comforting; so it is at times to the abdomen and other parts when there is coldness, but it aggravates the pains (Merc.).
"Painful paralytic weakness in the limbs.”
"Chill and heat alternating, now here, now there, on single parts.
Internal sensation of chilliness running from head to toes coming on when drinking." Many of the complaints of Veratrum are aggravated when drinking.
Burning while in cold sweat. In the chronic mental troubles, the skin is dusky and dry with the exception of that on the forehead. But in acute complaints where physical symptoms predominate, as in dysmenorrhoea, acute insanity, etc., there is profuse sweat.
Gnawing hunger in spite of nausea and vomiting. Empty, all-gone feeling in the abdomen after stool.
Zincum Metallicum
Zinc. has a full and substantial proving, including symptoms of every part of the body. It is an antipsoric, suitable in broken down constitutions, feeble constitutions; enfeeblement characterizes the whole proving.
The Zinc. patient is nervous and extremely sensitive, excitable, trembling, quivering, twitching of muscles, tearing pains along the course of the nerves, tingling, excited on the least provocation; oversensitiveness in one part and lack of feeling in another.
This extreme oversensitiveness is like Nux; which is inimical. The overworked and excitable persons belong to Nux and Zinc. Nux is sensitive to the higher potencies. Further, there is paralytic weakness, emaciation, prostration; full of brain and spinal symptoms.
Slowness: All the functions are slow; eruptions appear slowly.
The whole economy seems to be tired and feeble, so that when a girl approaches puberty and it is time for the menses to be established, but the flow does not appear, she goes into a decline; she begins to manifest choreic symptoms, jerking and twitching, soreness in the back of the neck, burning of the whole spine, creeping and crawling of the extremities, hysterical manifestations of all sorts.
Sensitive to every little noise, to people talking in the room, to crumpling of paper.
"Talking or listening is distressing; much talking of other people, even of those of who he is fond, affects his nerves and makes him morose."
Mind: Feeble children, feeble girls, mind feeble, memory poor.
Tendency to be docile, but when aroused irascible. If the child comes down with scarlatina or measles, it goes into a stupor. The eruption does not come out. There is a tendency to convulsions, drawing in the extremities, suppression of urine, rolling of the head from one side to the other, and from stupor it goes into complete unconsciousness; inability to throw eruptions to the surface.
Slowness again: The stomach is slow in digesting; sour vomiting.
The intestines are sluggish. The rectum becomes impacted. Difficult expulsion of urine; paralysis of the bladder and tedious constipation associated with spinal symptoms; urine slow in starting; can pass it only when sitting and in some cases only when sitting leaning back against the seat with hard pressure.
Back and limbs: Aching in the dorsal, lumbar, and sacral regions; better when walking and worse from rising from a seat. (In Rhus, the aching is in the sacral region, and better when walking and coming on while sitting. Calc., Rhus, Phos., Sulph. and Sepia have this in the highest degree. Zinc. occupies a lower grade in the aggravation when rising from a seat, as do Petr. and Ledum.)
Numbness of the soles of the feet, with cutting pain and soreness in the heel when stepping; fulgurating pains, stitching, stabbing, and tearing; tabes dorsalis.
Limbs paralyzed; paresis and finally paralysis of one or both sides jerking, trembling and prostration. Shocks and jerking during Sleep.
Trophic centers in a state of anaemia; emaciation throughout the body; the skin looks withered; the face pallid, wrinkled, unhealthy, sickly. Always chilly; sensitive to the cold. Full of neuralgic pains; tearing pains in all parts of the body when exposed to a draft; tension and drawing in various places.
Strange drawing about the eyes as if strabismus would come on; drawing in the muscles; neck drawn back; tension and drawing everywhere. When he comes to rest, the limbs want to draw up, hence, hysterical contractures; drawing the fingers all out of shape.
The mind is slow and the patient is weak and tired; weak memory; forgetful. "Repeats all questions before answering them."
When an individual does this it is to make the mind comprehend. He must first realize what it means and then answers. Such a symptom is found in typhoid, when the patient does not convalesce; in a child after brain affections.
Nervous prostration; waits a moment, looking blank, then, the face lights up and he answers. if you look at the Zincum patient and do not address him, you would not realize that he was so weak, but put a question to him and he stares at you in perfect amazement, then says, "Oh," and answers.
Zinc. is not suitable in those who are naturally feeble-minded, when the child is in a state bordering upon idiocy. Baryta carb. feeds such a mind. He rouses out of a semi-slumber and stares a moment without answering.
Stupor; aroused by every little noise, startles, twitches all over; but soon he goes beyond this, becoming less and less excitable, and finally passes into unconsciousness and cannot be aroused. You will find some deep- seated brain troubles that will try your patience.
Some cases go slowly and gradually into unconsciousness; rolling of the head for day s; eyes lusterless; body emaciated, involuntary discharges of faeces and urine in the bed; tongue dry and parched, so shriveled that it looks like leather, lips also; lice withered and each day looks older; paralysis of one hand or one foot, or it seems that the whole muscular system is paralyzed.
Screaming out in pain although not so shrilly as in Apis. A dose of Zinc. will sometimes bring this patient back to life. In a few days after the remedy there will be a jerking and quivering in the parts that were motionless, or its action will be shown in a copious sweat, much vomiting; sudden arousing that is alarming, for it looks like a threatened sinking, but this is the beginning of reaction.
Now, for days and nights while this little one is coming back to consciousness, the restoration of sensation in the parts is accompanied with the most tormenting formication, tingling, prickling, creeping, and crawling. The mother and the father and the neighbors will want something done for it, but if you antidote, the case will return to where it was before. This suffering is but the awakening to life.
It will go on in this way for a week or two and then will begin to show signs of falling back; it needs another dose of Zinc., which will again be followed by a sweat, vomiting, etc. You will see this in spinal meningitis. The early stage will be that of congestion, and Bell. may palliate, but with the onset of the symptoms enumerated above, Zinc. is the only remedy that will cure. The Bell. case will have flushed face, hot head, rolling of the head, flashing eyes, throbbing carotids. The Bry. case will be docile, stupid, purple, sleepy; ameliorated by quiet.
The Helleborus case will exhibit but little fever; cold extremities, tossing of the head, dilated pupils, unconsciousness, can hardly be aroused; rolling head from. side to side, but when the reflexes are abolished, Zinc. comes in.
After the relief from Gels., Bell., or Bry. give Zinc. Rugged little fellows who hang on for weeks in this state, emaciating and unconscious.
You must take the mother aside and inform her what will happen if the child returns to consciousness. If you do not, you may be turned out of the house. A person advanced in years cannot stand such an ordeal, but it is astonishing how the little ones can endure the prolonged congestion and inflammation.
After scarlet fever and badly treated meningitis; tubercular meningitis. I have carried these severe forms of brain disease through on Phosphorus, which has a picture somewhat like that of Zincum. There is no record of any recovery from tubercular meningitis, but a homoeopath can cure some of these cases, though it may take two or three months to go down and come up out of it, with two or three relapses.
Eyes: Among the eye symptoms we have a peculiar thickening and opacity of the conjunctiva, which is infiltrated, leathery, has yellow spots on it and the corners are thickened like pterygium. Dunham made a remarkable cure of pterygium. The report of the case in the Guiding Symptoms is as follows:
"Pterygium in right eye just encroaching on cornea; in left eye extending to the pupil from the inner canthus."
"Itching and stinging plain in inner angles of eyes with cloudiness of sight.
Much burning of the eyes and lids in the morning and in the evening with feeling of dryness and pressure in them."
Zinc. has cured distressing thickening of the lids, ectropion and entropion; granular thickening of the lids. In a severe case of entropion where the lashes were playing up and down the ball with lachrymation, great inflammation and redness, Zinc. removed the whole trouble. Violent photophobia; it seems as if the light would blind him. Zinc. and Euphr. are closely related in eye troubles.
Strabismus after brain troubles. Ever since scarlet fever, he had strabismus. She has much trouble with the menses; dysmenorrhoea.
Menses: But here is a striking symptom; no matter what the violent symptoms are pains in the ovaries, in the uterus, hysterical excitement; as soon as the menstrual flow appears there is relief.
Violent pains in the ovaries relieved by the flow. This is a great contrast to Cimicifuga, which has nervous excitement and hysteria during the flow, and the, more copious it is, the more violent are the pains.
The Lach. and Zinc. symptoms are worse before, and better with the flow, but in the former the pains all return when the flow slacks up again. Cimicifuga has at times an intermittent flow, then pain ceasing with each intermission, returning when the flow again appears.
The great nervousness of Zinc. is manifested in the feet. You will notice a child or a woman keeping one foot going all the time, cannot keep it still. Many medicines have nervous feet and many have relief of symptoms by motion of the feet. But this is marked in Zinc. A girl about twelve years of age had no congruity of symptoms and I could not find the remedy.
The mother said the child mortified her by keeping one foot constantly going in church. On asking why she did this, she replied that if she stopped she would lose her urine. Zinc. cured the whole patient. In the text we find double-lined the two words,
"Fidgety feet."
Zinc. has some striking heart symptoms. Constriction of the whole chest in weakly subjects.
