HOMOEOPATHIC MATERIA MEDICA 
by William BOERICKE, M.D. 

PREFACE TO THE NINTH EDITION 

In preparing the ninth edition of this work, I have 
followed the lines laid out for all the previous editions, 
namely, to present in a condensed form the homceopathic 
Materia Medica for practical use. 

The book contains the well known verified characteristic 
symptoms of all our medicines besides other less important 
symptoms aiding the selection of the curative remedy, All the 
new medicines and essentials of the published clinical 
experience of the school have been added. In its present 
compact form it contains the maximum number of reliable 
Materia Medica facts in the minimum space. 

I have tried to give a succinct resume of the 

William Boericke 
1849-1929, US symptomatology of every medicine used in Homeopathy, 

including also clinical suggestions of many drugs so far not yet 
based on provings, thus offering the opportunity to experiment with these and by future provings 
discover their distinctive use and so enlarging our armamentarium. 

I am aware that there is a difference of opinion about the advisability of further 
introduction of remedies, especially of such as seem obsolete or to some minds illusory. But it is 
not for the compiler to leave out information about any substance that has received the clinical 
endorsement from a reliable source. 

Our Materia Medica must include all substances which have been proved and which have 
been used with apparent efficacy. It rests with the individual student to judge for himself the accuracy 
and, reliability of such observation. In this connection, I cannot forego to avail myself 
of the high authority of that master of Homceopathy, Dr. Constantine Hering, favoring the 
introduction of all remedies capable of producing reactions in the body that may guide to their 
medicinal employment. "Homeopathy is essentially not only many-sided but all-sided. She 
investigates the action of all substances, whether articles of diet, beverages, condiments, drugs or 
poisons. She investigates their action on the healthy, the sick, animals and plants. She gives; a 
new interpretation to that ancient, oft quoted saying of Paul, Prove all things--a new meaning, a 
new application that acts universally. Elimination of the useless may gradually take place with 
the growth of accurate physiological and pathological knowledge." 

Again, imperfectly proved remedies necessitate the use of names of diseases at times 
instead of the component symptoms that alone are the legitimate guide to the choice of the 
curative remedy. Here, too, I have Hering as pioneer guide for the ligitimacy of this method, 
which he also followed in his great work, the Guiding Symptoms. He said that he used the 
disease designations not for the purpose of recommending the particular remedy for that disease, 
but to show the great variety of remedies that may be used for any form of disease when 
otherwise indicated. For the same reason I have included nosological terms in the 
symptomatology and Therapeutic Index, as this is a practical handbook for every-day service, 
and any aid for finding the curative remedy ought to be utilized. As Dr. J. Compton Burnett 
expresses it: 

"The fact is we need any and every way of finding the right remedy; the simple simile, the 
simple symptomatic similimum and the farthest reach of all-the pathologic similimum, and I 
maintain that we are still well within the line- of Homceopathy that is expansive, progressive, 
science fostered and science fostering." 

The dosage needs some apology. It is, of course, suggestive only; more often to be wholly 
disregarded. I have followed the lines of the earlier Homceopathists in this regard, and given 
what was then considered the usual range of potency, to which I have added my own experience 
and that of many observing practitioners. Every teacher of Materia Medica is constantly 
importuned by students to suggest the potency--something to start with at least. 

The book is in no sense a treatise, and must not be considered or judged as such. It is as accurate 
and reliable a compilation and the fullest collection of verified Materia Medica facts and clinical 
suggestions as it is possible to obtain within the compass of the volume. It supplements every 
other work on Materia Medica, and if used as a ready reminder of the essential facts of our vast 
symptomatology and as an introduction to the larger books of reference and record of 
provings, it will fulfill its purpose and prove a useful aid to the student and general practitioner. 
As such it is again offered with much appreciation of past endorsement to his professional 
brethren. 

I have been aided in seeing this edition through the press by the efficient help of Mr. F. O. 
Ernesty, who has lightened the labor of making the manuscript more acceptable to the printers, 
and I desire to express my hearty appreciation of this kind and helpful service.

Dose.--Five to ten drops of the tincture. 

ADRENALINUM 
An Internal Secretion of Suprarenal Glands 
(ADRENALIN) 
Adrenaline or Epinephrine, the active principle of the medulla of the suprarenal gland, (cortical 
secretion not as yet isolated), is employed as a chemical messenger in the regulation of the 
activities of the body; in fact, its presence is essential to the activity of the sympathetic nerve. 
Adrenaline action on any part is the same as stimulation of the sympathetic nerve endings 
thereto. Local application (1: 1,000 solution) to mucous membranes promptly induces transient 
ischemia, seen in a blanching, persisting several hours from conjunctival instillation. Its action is 
very prompt, efficient, evanescent, owing to rapid oxidation and therefore practically harmless, 
unless too frequently repeated, when atheroma and heart lesions--myocardial--in animals have 
been reported. Arteries, heart, supra-renal bodies and vaso-motor system are prominently 
affected. The main action of Adrenaline is stimulation of the sympathetic endings, notably the 
splanchnic area, causing constriction of the peripheral arterioles, with resulting rise in blood 
pressure. This is especially observed in stomach, intestines; less in uterus, skin; nil in brain and 
lungs. Furthermore, is noticed, s/owing of pulse, (medullary vagus stimulation), and 
strengthening of heart beat (increased myocardial contractility), resembling Digitalis; increased 
glandular activity, glycosuria; depression of respiratory center; contraction of muscular tissue of 
eye, uterus, vagina; relaxation of muscular tissue of stomach, intestines, bladder. 
Uses.--Its chief therapeutic use depends on its vaso-constriction action; therefore a most 
powerful and prompt astringent and hemostatic; and invaluable in checking capillary 
heemorrhages, from a// parts, where /ocal or direct application is feasible: nose, ear, mouth, 
throat, larynx, stomach, rectum, uterus, bladder. Hemorrhagic condition not due to defective 
coagulation of the blood. Complete b/oodlessness, ischemia, may be induced with impunity. 
Locally, solutions (1: 10,000-1: 1,000) sprayed or applied on cotton have been very efficient in 
bloodless operations about the eye, nose, throat, and larynx. 
Congestions of the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, also hay fever, have been markedly alleviated 
by warm spray of Adrenaline chloride, 1: 5,000. Here compare, Hepar 1x, which will start up 
secretions and so facilitate drainage. Werlhoff's disease, hypodermically, 1: 1,000. Externally, it 
has been used in neuritis, neuralgia, reflex pains, gout, rheumatism, as an ointment, 1-2 m of (1: 
1,000) solution, along the nerve trunk at point of skin nearest its origin which could be reached 
(H. G. Carlton). 
Therapeutically, Adrenaline has been suggested in acute congestion of lungs, Asthma, Grave's 
and Addison's diseases, arterio-sclerosis, chronic aortitis, angina pectoris, hemophilia chlorosis, 
hay fever, serum rashes, acute urticaria, etc. Dr. P. Jousset reports success in treating, 
homeopathically, cases of angina and of aortitis, sub-acute and chronic, when Adrenaline has 
been prescribed per os and in infinitesimal dose. The symptom guiding to this is, Sensation of 
thoracic constriction with anguish. This, with vertigo, nausea and vomiting have been produced 
by the drug. Abdominal pain. Shock or heart failure during anzesthesia, as it causes very prompt 
rise of blood pressure by its action on nerve endings in the vessel wall. 
Dose.--Hypodermically, 1-5 m (1: 1,000 solution, as chloride) diluted in water. Internally, 5-30m 
of 1: 1,000 solution. 
Caution.--On account of its affinity for oxygen, the drug easily decomposes in watery and dilute 
acid solutions. The solution must be protected from air and light. It must not be too frequently 
repeated, owing to cardiac and arterial lesions. For homeopathic use 2x to 6x attenuation.

AGARICUS MUSCARIUS 
Toad Stool-Bug Agaric 
(AGARICUS MUSCARIUS-AMANITA) 
This fungus contains several toxic compounds, the best known of which is Muscarin. The 
symptoms of poisoning do not develop at once, usually twelve to fourteen hours elapse before 
the initial attack. There is no antidote, treatment, entirely symptomatic (Schneider). Agaricus acts 
as an intoxicant to the brain, producing more vertigo and delirium than alcohol, followed by 
profound sopor with lowered reflexes. 
Jerking, twitching, trembling, and itching are strong indications. Incipient phthisis; is related to 
the tubercular diathesis, anzemia, chorea, twitching ceases during sleep. Various forms of 
neuralgia and spasmodic affections, and neurotic skin troubles are pictured in the 
symptomatology of this remedy. It corresponds to various forms of cerebral excitement rather 
than congestion. Thus, in delirium of fevers, alcoholism, etc. General paralysis. Sensation as if

2. More decided intoxication-great mental excitement and incoherent talking, immoderate gaity 
alternates with melancholy. Perception of relative size of objects is lost, takes long steps and 
jumps over small objects as if they were trunks of trees-a small hole appears as a frightful chasm, 
a spoonful of water an immense lake. Physical strength is increased, can lift heavy loads. With it 
much twitching. 
3. Third stage produces a condition of furious or raging delirium, screaming, raving, wants to 
injure himself, etc. 
4. Fourth stage-mental depression, languor, indifference, confusion, disinclination to work, etc.

Relationship.--Compare: Muscarine, the alkaloid of Agaricus (has much power over secretions, 
increasing lachrymal, salivary, hepatic, etc, but diminishing renal; probably neurotic in origin, 
stimulating the terminal fibers of the secretory nerves of all these structures, hence salivation, 
lachrymation and excessive perspiration. Atropin exactly opposes Muscarine. Resembles 
Pilocarpin in action). Amanita vernus-spring mushroom-a variety of Agar Phalloides-Death cup- 
active principle is Phallin, active like Muscarine. Amanita phalloides (Death Cup-Deadly 
Agaric). The poison is a toxalbumin, resembling the poison in the rattle snake and the poison 
excreted by the cholera and diphtheria germs. It acts on the red blood corpuscles, dissolving 
them so that blood escapes into the alimentary canal and the whole system is drained. The 
amount of this toxic principle is small, even handling of specimens and breathing of spores 
affects some people unpleasantly. The poison is slow in development. Even 12 to 20 hours after 
taking it the patient feels all right, but vertigo violent choleraic symptoms with rapid loss of

AURUM METALLICUM 
Metallic Gold 
Given full play, Aurum develops in the organism, by attacking the blood, glands, and bone, 
conditions bearing striking resemblance to mercurial and syphilitic infections; and it is just for 
such deteriorations of the bodily fluids and alterations in the tissues, that Aurum assumes great 
importance as a remedy. Like the victim of syphilis, mental states of great depression are 
produced by it. Hopeless, despondent, and great desire to commit suicide. Every opportunity is 
sought for self-destruction. Exostosis, caries, nightly bone-pains, especially cranial, nasal, and 
palatine. Glands swollen in scrofulous subjects. Palpitation and congestions. Ascites often in 
conjunction with heart affections. Frequently indicated in secondary syphilis and effects of 
mercury. This use of gold as an anti-venereal and anti-scrofulous remedy is very old, but has 
been well-nigh forgotten by the old school until rediscovered and placed on its scientific basis by 
homeopathy, and now it can never be lost again. When syphilis is implanted on the scrofulous 
constitution, we have one of the most intractable morbid conditions, and gold seems to be 
especially suited to the vile combination. Ennui. Ozena; sexual hyperesthesia. Arterio-sclerosis,
