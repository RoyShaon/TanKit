Aconitum napellus
 
 (acon.) 
 (Monkshood.) 
 (The freshly expressed juice of the plant at the time of the commencement of flowering 
mixed with equal parts of spirits of wine). 
 Although the following symptoms do not express the whole significance of this most 
valuable plant; still they reveal to the thoughtful homoeopathic physician a prospect of 
relieving morbid conditions in which traditional medicine has hitherto employed its most 
dangerous methods, e.g. copious blood-letting and all its complex would-be 
antiphlogistic treatments, often ineffectually, and almost always with disastrous 
consequences. 
 I allude to the so-called pure inflammatory fevers, in which the smallest dose of aconite 
enables us to dispense with all the traditional antipathic treatments; and relieves rapidly 
and without evil effects. 
 In measles, in purpura miliaris, and in the acute pleuritic fevers, c., its curative power is 
marvellous, when, the patient being kept rather cool, it is given alone, all other medicinal 
substances, even vegetable acids, being avoided, in the dose of a thousandth part of a 
drop of the decillionth development of power. 
 It is seldom that a second similar dose is required thirty-six or forty-eight hours after the 
first. 
 But in order to remove from our conscientious treatment all that routine practice which is 
only too apt to regulate its treatment in accordance with delusive names of diseases, it is 
indispensable that, in all morbid conditions in which aconite is given, the chief symptoms 
of the malady, therefore also of the acute disease, should be found accurately reproduced 
among the symptoms of aconite. 
 The effect is then astonishing. 
 It is precisely in the great acute inflammatory fevers in which allopathy chiefly plumes 
itself as alone able to save life by means of bold, frequent venesections, and imagines that 
here it is superior in curative efficacy to all homoeopathic treatment-it is precisely here 
that it is most mistaken. 
 It is precisely here that the infinite superiority of homoeopathy is manifest, that it needs 
not to shed a single drop of blood, that precious vital fluid (which the allopath recklessly 
draws off in streams, to the often irremediable disadvantage of the patient), in order to 
transform this dangerous fever into health in as many hours as the allopathic vitality diminishing treatment often requires months for the perfect restoration of those who are 
not carried off during the process by death, or, at all events, in the chronic after-affections 
artificially caused by the means employed. 
 In these acute cases of disease sometimes a homoeopathic intermediate remedy is 
required for the morbid symptoms remaining after twelve or sixteen hours' action of the 
first dose of aconite; but it is very rarely that a second dose of aconite is needed after this 
intermediate remedy. 
 By means of aconite carefully administered in this way in a disease of the above mentioned character all danger is removed even in four hours, and the excited circulation 
resumes its tranquil vital course from hour to hour. 
 Although aconite, on account of the short duration of its action (which in such small 
doses does not exceed forty-eight hours), might seem to be useful only in acute diseases, 
yet it is an indispensable accessory remedy in even the most obstinate chronic affections, 
when the system requires a diminution of the so-called tension of the blood-vessels (the 
strictum of the ancients). 
 On this subject, however, I cannot enter more fully in this place. 
 Its utility in such cases is shown by the symptoms it produces in the healthy subject, 
which are partially recorded in the following pages. 
 Aconite is also the first and main remedy, in the minute dose indicated above, in 
inflammation of the windpipe (croup, membranous laryngitis), in various kinds of 
inflammation of the throat and fauces, as also in the local acute inflammations of all other 
parts, particularly where, in addition to thirst and quick pulse, there are present anxious 
impatience, an unappeasable mental agitation, and agonizing tossing about. 
 It produces all the morbid states similar to those seen in persons who have had a fright 
combined with vexation, and is also the surest and quickest remedy for them. 
 In the selection of aconite as a homoeopathic remedy particular attention should be paid 
to the symptoms of the disposition, so that they should be very similar. 
 Hence it is indispensable after fright or vexation in women during the catamenia, which 
without this excellent soothing remedy are only too easily, often instantaneously, 
suppressed by such emotional disturbances. 
 For this purpose a single momentary olfaction at a phial containing a globule the size of 
a mustard-seed, moistened with the decillionth potency of aconite (which may be kept for 
this use for years in a well-corked phial without losing its curative power) is quite 
sufficient. 
 Most of the apparently opposite aconite symptoms recorded below are merely alternating 
states, and it may be curative by means of both but it is most so in respect of those which 
have a tonic character. 
 Vegetable acids and wine antidote its effects, and so do other medicines which 
correspond palliatively or homoeopathically to some of its troublesome symptoms 
(produced by too large a dose or unhomoeopathic selection).

 Ambra grisea 
 
 (ambr.) 
 (Ambergris, sometimes Ambra ambrosiaca, L.) 
 This substance, often adulterated on account of its high price, we can hope to get genuine 
only in first-class drug stores. 
 The true ambergris, developed in the intestines of the sperm whale, as was proved by 
SCHWEDJAUR, and probably a fatty excretion from its gall-bladder, is obtained of best 
quality from the sea, especially after stormy weather, off the coasts of Madagascar and 
Sumatra. 
 It consists of small, rough, opaque masses, which are lighter than water, of spongy 
consistence, and can easily be broken up into rough, uneven pieces, externally of a 
brownish-grey colour, internally permeated by yellowish, reddish, and blackish fibres 
intermingled with whitish, very odorous points, somewhat greasy to the touch, and of 
faint but very refreshing fragrance. 
 By the warmth of the fingers it becomes soft as wax, by the heat of boiling water it melts 
into oil, at the same time exhales a strong, very agreeable fragrance, and on heated metal 
burns quite away. 
 On applying a light to it it quickly takes fire, and burns with a bright flame. 
 Alcohol dissolves it very sparingly, but sulphuric ether dissolves it almost completely, 
and on adding alcohol a white wax-like substance is thrown down. 
 It feeble odour is much increased by this solution, as also by triturating it with other 
substances. 
 A grain of such genuine ambergris is triturated for an hour with 100 grains of milk-sugar 
in a porcelain mortar (every 10 minutes divided between 6 minutes of trituration and 4 
minutes of scraping). 
 Of this powder a grain is again triturated with another 100 grains of milk-sugar for an 
equal length of time, and in the same manner; and, lastly, of this powder so obtained one 
grain is again triturated with a similar quantity of milk-sugar, in the same manner, and 
also for an hour. 
 This furnishes a potentized millionth attenuation of ambergris, a small portion of a grain 
of which is not only sufficient for a dose for most homoeopathic purposes, but is often 
found to be quite too powerful; in which case its effects may be moderated by several 
small doses of camphor, but in many cases, according to the symptoms developed, by 
nux vomica, and in rarer cases by pulsatilla. 
 The duration of the action of such a dose is, in chronic cases, at least three weeks. (The 
symptoms indicated by the letters Gff. were observed by the State-councillor Freiherr von 
GERSDORFF.) 
 [None of the symptoms are derived from old-school sources. Ambra first appears among 
Hahnemann's medicines in the and edition.]

 Angustura vera 
 
 (Angustura Vera : ang.) 
 (Angustura or Augusturoe.) 
 (The best pieces of the bark of this South American tree, called Bonplandia trifoliata, are 
about one line in thickness, slightly bent, on their external convex side covered with a 
greyish-white, easily scraped off, fine coating; traversed by fine transverse furrows; on 
the inner concave surface of a bright brownish yellow, very friable, and cinnamon 
coloured and porous on the fractured surface; of a disagreeable spicy smell, and of a 
penetrating, somewhat hot, spicy bitter taste, the powder of which resembles rhubarb 
powder in colour; the decoction is not precipitated by a solution of sulphate of iron. Fifty 
grains of this powder digested in 1000 drops alcohol without heat so as to form a tincture 
are employed for medicinal after appropriate dilution). 
 For many years complaints have been publicly made about a substitution in commerce 
for this true angustura bark of a false bark, which displays dangerous and poisonous 
properties, and for many years the tree from which this false bark was derived was 
unknown. 
 Now the Brucea ferruginea is said to be the tree from which this false suspicious bark is 
derived; chemical investigation has shown that it furnishes the same alkaloid as nux 
vomica, ignatia, c. However, the above-described genuine angustura bark likewise 
possesses uncommonly great medicinal power, so that, when it is procured direct from 
the tree Bonplandia trifoliata at St. Thomas del Angustura, in South America, as it is 
now, without any doubt it can, like every other very powerful medicine, do great harm if 
given in immoderate does and in unsuitable cases. 
 In F.A.G. Emmert's Curgeschichte (Hufeland's Journ., August, 1815, p.75) a case is 
related where three tablespoonfuls of a decoction of five ounces of (presumably spurious) 
angustura bark, evaporated to five ounces of liquid, were given to a boy five and a half 
years old. 
 This unreasonable dose, which contained about an ounce and a half of angustura power, 
proved fatal, as we read with a shudder, in a couple of hours, with horrible sufferings. 
 This substance would in the same dose have a like effect not only on a boy but on an 
adult person. 
 In this fatal case described by EMMERT the boy presented the following symptoms : 
Trembling, soon passing into violent convulsions (aft. 1/2 h.) When the medical attendant 
touched the arm in order to feel the pulse tetanus suddenly ensued. 
 The eyelids were wide open. 
 The eyes were staring, projecting, and immovable. 
 Trismus, with wide separation of the lips, so that the front teeth were quite exposed. 
 Tension of individual facial muscles. 
 The limbs were stretched out to the utmost, stiff, and stark. 
 The spinal column and the head strongly drawn backwards. 
 The trunk was from time to time shaken by violent jerking along the back, as from 
electric shocks, and somewhat raised. 
 Cheeks and lips became blue. 
 Respiration intermitting. 
 After an attack that lasted six minutes the boy breathed with great effort, panting, with 
blueness of the cheeks and lips. 
 Great and frequent longing for coffee. 
 Even swallowing tepid water excited tetanic spasms. 
 Pulse 102, spasmodic, irregular. 
 The tetanus sometimes returned without perceptible cause, sometimes was excited by a 
noise, or by touching any portion of the body; he constantly called out that no one should 
touch him. 
 After the tetanus the eyes were closed, the forehead and face covered with sweat; 
blueness of the cheeks and lips; groaning without (acknowledged) pains. 
 The whole body became flaccid and relaxed; the eye dead-like convulsive breathing 
came back only after long pauses. 
 Death after an hour. 
 Half an hour after death the body was stiff and stark. 
 After twenty-four hours there was already a strong corpse-like smell outside and inside; 
on opening the veins cherry-coloured fluid blood was found. 
 The right lung was externally pale and bloated, internally full of blood; the left lung was 
externally blue, when incised blackish and very heavy from blood. 
 Besides the above other reports of the consequences of strong doses of angustura have 
been recorded, such as spasmodic twitchings, vertigo, anxiety, immobility of the muscles 
as from stiffening, and a report has been communicated to me by the late. 
 Dr. Würzner, of Eilenburg, relating to four persons, each of whom took from ten to 
twelve grains of the extract in the form of pills, in whom there occurred : Stiffness of all 
the muscles of the body, like tetanus; one fell to the ground suddenly, retaining his 
consciousness. 
 Closure of the jaws, trismus. 
 Very similar though slighter symptoms will be found in the following list of the effects 
of carefully selected pieces of angustura bark on the healthy body. 
 I have employed for homoeopathic purposes the smallest portion of a drop of the 
billionth dilution of the above-described alcoholic tincture, but have found that in some 
cases a still higher dilution would have been more suitable Camphor is not an antidote for 
its too violent effects, but coffee is.

 Argentum metallicum 
 
 (Argentum Metallicum : arg-m.) 
 (Silver.) 
 This metal in its pure state, as leaf-silver (argentum foliatum), from the supposed 
impossibility of its being dissolved in our juices-an impossibility that has no better basis 
than theoretical speculation-is said by the teachers of materia medica to be just as 
powerless as gold (which see). 
 At first I allowed myself to be deterred by these confident assertions from using it 
medicinally, and therefore employed only the solution of nitrate of silver (in the dose of a 
drop of the quintillionth dilution), when I had the opportunity of observing the few 
subjoined symptoms caused by it. 
 But, in spite of all the denials of theorists without experience, who always persist in 
regarding the stomach as a cooking or digesting machine, containing gastric juice which, 
judging by their trials in the vessels of their laboratory, they found to be incapable of 
dissolving either metallic gold or metallic silver, and therefore considered these 
medicines to be incapable of exciting any action upon us such as they do when 
chemically dissolved lege artis in the stomach, when they are methodice absorbed and 
introduced into the circulation of the blood; influenced by the reasons I have adduced 
respecting gold, I could not refrain from employing pure silver in the metallic state. 
 I therefore made experiments on the healthy body with leaf-silver, after triturating it for 
an hour to the finest powder, with a hundred parts of milk-sugar. 
 The few symptoms observed from it and set forth in the following pages furnish the 
homoeopathic physician, in silver under this form, with a curative instrument in many 
similar morbid states, which cannot be cured by any other medicinal agent, and for which 
the ordinary physician fails to find a remedy in all his therapeutics, clinical experience 
and voluminous prescription-books. 
 But I subsequently found that for homoeopathic use another hundred-fold attenuation, 
that is to say, a grain of powder containing 1/10000th of silver, may be a still too large 
dose. 
 The empirical reputation of nitrate of silver in the ordinary forms of epilepsy is not well 
founded, and seems to have arisen from the circumstance that in some varieties of 
convulsions, where copper is indicated, a salt of silver containing copper has been used. 
 But that pure silver, such as leaf-silver is, should be efficacious in the worst and 
commonest form of epilepsy, is not borne out by the primary symptoms as yet revealed 
from its administration. 
 R.BOYLE'S so-called diuretic pills, which contain nitrate of silver, and which are so 
much praised by BOERHAVE, are quite unsuitable for their purpose, not only on account 
of the perilous size of the doses, but also because silver, as the subjoined symptoms 
produced by it show, only increases the urinary secretion in its primary action 
(consequently the opposite of the diminished urinary secretion in dropsical diseases), 
whereupon, by means of the ensuing reaction of the vital force, the opposite of the end 
aimed at must take place, which is its permanent secondary action, to wit, a still greater 
diminution of the urinary secretion; a true antipathic and, for this case, injurious 
procedure. 
 Such hurtful mistakes must have hitherto been committed by the ordinary physicians, 
because they were unacquainted with the primary effects of the medicines, and knew of 
no way whereby they could learn them, and took no pains to discover the right way. 
 Indeed, for five- and-twenty centuries they have had no notion of primary and secondary 
actions, and knew not that the human organism develops as secondary action of 
medicines, as a permanent condition, the exact opposite of their primary action, and that, 
consequently, in order to effect any permanent cure, medicines to be really curative must 
be able to produce in their primary action the simile of the morbid state actually present, 
to allow us to expect from the reaction of the organism the opposite of the medicinal 
primary action (and of the disease similar to it), that is to say, the destruction and 
alteration into health of the deranged sensations and functions. 
 On the other hand, silver can cure permanently some kinds of diabetes when the other 
symptoms of the disease correspond in similarity to the other primary symptoms of the 
disease. [HAHNEMANN was assisted in this proving by - FRANZ, GROSS, HAYNEL, 
HARTMANN, HERRMANN, LANGHAMMER, MEYER, WISLICENUS. The 
following old-school authorities were consulted for the effects of nitrate of silver : 
HALL, THOM., Phys. Med. Journal, 1800, July, also in Duncan's Annals of Med., v, 
1801. KINGLAKE, London Medical and Physical Journal, 1801. MOODIE, Med. and 
Phys. Journal, 1804. No old-school writers are quoted for effects of metallic silver. The 
1st edit.gave 200 symptoms to silver, to this 2nd edit. 23 have been added.]

Arnica Montana

(arn.)
(Leopard's bane)
(The tincture is prepared from the fresh root.)
The following symptoms have been observed from this plant. It is particularly useful for morbid states resulting from falls, blows, contusions, and lacerations of the solid parts.
For external injuries, the expressed juice diluted with water, or a lotion made from the tincture (a few drops to a basin of water), is often helpful.
Internally, the decillionth potency is usually sufficient.
Its action is of moderate duration.
Camphor appears to be an effective antidote. Ignatia also often proves useful after it. Ipecacuanha, for vomiting of blood; Aconite, for fever with pain; Rhus tox., for pains in the limbs. Arsenicum is also sometimes needed.
After the abuse of Arnica, Cinchona is often serviceable.
Its use is contraindicated in cases with a tendency to loose stools or diarrhoea.
